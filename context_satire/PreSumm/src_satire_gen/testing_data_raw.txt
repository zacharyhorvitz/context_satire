as fear of a conflict with iran rises , democrats want to make clear that they will not support any offensive military action against the country unless there is prior authorization from congress . but they have already come to the realization that their message will have little practical effect , as the republican-led senate wo n't pass a duo of democratic measures . last week , the democratic-led house passed a bill that included a provision to repeal the post-september 11 authorization for use of military force , which the trump administration may use as a legal justification for a war with iran . this week , senate democrats have pressured majority leader mitch mcconnell to require congressional approval to fund any such conflict as an amendment to the annual , must-pass defense policy bill . source : for the last week , republican members of the oregon state senate have been in hiding , fleeing the state rather than be forced to vote on a climate bill that would put a hard cap on greenhouse gas emissions . the goal ? to run out the clock until the legislative session ends at the end of the month , robbing majority democrats -- and the democratic governor -- of a major priority . how did we get here ? source : on thursday , the supreme court showed how much difference who wins the presidency makes . armed with a five to four conservative majority thanks to president donald trump 's appointment of neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh over the past two years , the supreme court said it had no role to play in partisan gerrymandering -- a decision that amounts to a massive political victory for republicans , not just in the moment , but also likely for the next decade-plus . while the court did n't give republicans everything they wanted on thursday -- rejecting the addition of a citizenship question to the census that the trump administration had pushed for -- the ruling on line-drawing with political concerns as a primary motivation is an absolute game-changer for a party that has already reaped the considerable rewards of its ongoing domination at the state legislative level . what scotus said thursday was , essentially , if state legislators want to draw the lines of their own districts and those of their members of congress using political calculations , it 's not the court 's job to stop them .
the frenetic pace of presidential campaigning that has crested in the last few days -- in which the candidates or their surrogates hit 10 states -- wo n't end when voters go to the polls on tuesday . republican candidate mitt romney will campaign in two states on election day - ohio and pennsylvania - according to a romney campaign official . campaigning on election day , a senior romney adviser says , will help `` keep the energy going '' until the polls close . the idea is that the campaign is `` just going to keep working up until the polls close , '' said the same romney adviser . source : on the eve of the presidential election , mitt romney and president obama both made their emotional final appeals to voters . speaking in des moines , michelle obama delivered a passionate speech about the race and the president appeared to wipe away tears at what will be his final campaign event . on starting point this morning , obama campaign surrogate rep. jim clyburn discusses the emotional side of political campaigns and weighs in on how hurricane sandy may influence the election results . `` obama did a tremendous job reaching out to the other side time and time again , '' clyburn says . source : in the end , the etch a sketch did n't work . mitt romney , the multimillionaire who touted his business credentials as the republican presidential hopeful , failed to convince voters that he was the man to unseat president barack obama and jump-start the economy . `` we have given our all to this campaign , '' romney told supporters in his concession speech . `` i so wish that i had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country in a different direction , but the nation chose another leader , and so ann and i join with you to earnestly pray for him and this great nation . ''
the split screen told the story -- when mitt romney was speaking , president barack obama was looking down ; when obama was speaking , romney was looking at the president . `` it has killed jobs , '' romney said during wednesday 's debate about the politically charged health care law pushed by obama . `` obamacare , the congressional budget office has said , will cost $ 2,500 a year more than traditional insurance . '' romney looked at the crowd , moderator jim lehrer and even obama during the exchange . source : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is slated to talk later today at the united nations general assembly . ahmadinejad 's speech follows one from president obama , who yesterday laid out clear opposition to any encroachment on a nuclear iran . a mile away at the clinton global initiative gop nominee mitt romney kept up his attack on the president 's foreign policy . this morning , romney supporter and former mayor of new york city , rudy giuliani -lrb- r-ny -rrb- joins `` starting point '' to discuss obama 's foreign policy decisions . source : with 35 days till the election , president barack obama and mitt romney prepare to face off at the first presidential debate on wednesday . while the debate will focus on both economic and domestic policy issues , governor bob mcdonnell -lrb- r-va -rrb- argues that romney should concentrate on the economy , where he believes the republican candidate has an edge . mcdonnell also argues that questions on immigration will not hurt the republican candidate , stating that immigration is not `` an issue that is going to move a lot of voters . ''
president donald trump said on thursday that he would rather have a government shutdown fight over his immigration and border security demands before the midterm elections this november than afterward . `` i would personally prefer before , but whether it 's before or after , we 're either getting it or we 're closing down government , '' trump said . `` we need border security . we need border security . '' source : sharice davids , the attorney and former professional mixed martial arts fighter who won the democratic nomination for a house seat in kansas on tuesday , is the latest potentially history-making candidate in 2018 's midterm elections . if she defeats republican rep. kevin yoder in november , davids would join new mexico 's deb haaland as part of a class that 's expected to include the first native american women ever elected to congress . davids would also become the second-ever openly lesbian member of congress , after wisconsin sen. tammy baldwin . and she would be the first openly lgbt person to represent deep-red kansas , where pro-gay rights activists have spent years fighting bills they see as discriminatory on issues like adoption and participation in college campus groups , at the state or federal level . source : members of congress make fact-finding missions to learn about other countries and stay informed , but these outings can cause controversy if the trip is deemed excessive or unconnected with the task of governing . for example , the wall street journal reported in 2009 that lawmaker trips abroad at taxpayer expense had included spas , $ 300-per-night extra unused rooms , and shopping excursions . -lsb- 186 -rsb- lawmakers respond that `` traveling with spouses compensates for being away from them a lot in washington '' and justify the trips as a way to meet officials in other nations . -lsb- 186 -rsb-

the trump administration , under pressure from conservative lawmakers , appears increasingly open to changing legislation repealing and replacing obamacare in order to placate the right -- but that may guarantee at least this version of the bill is as good as dead in the senate . the political calculation is setting off a domino effect on capitol hill . just days to go before a thursday vote on the house gop bill , moderate republicans have already expressed deep reservations about making drastic reforms to the current health care system . making additional changes to satisfy conservatives is certain to strengthen opposition among centrist republicans . source : a new poll finds that many americans are not optimistic about what the gop health care bill will do to their coverage . although president donald trump and republicans in congress promise that their plan will cover more people and cost less , nearly half of americans do n't believe it , according to a kaiser family foundation poll released wednesday . and while many republicans are confident that defunding planned parenthood is the right move , the greater majority oppose that idea , it says . this is the latest poll on the legislation from the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation . source : older working class americans would get hit hard under the republicans ' proposal to repeal and replace obamacare . the congressional budget office analysis , released monday , found that a 64-year-old could see his premium on the individual market climb by as much as 25 % under the gop 's america 's health care act . that 's largely because insurers would be able to charge older enrollees more compared to what obamacare allows . older folks with lower incomes would really feel the difference since the refundable tax credits provided under the gop bill are not as generous for this group as obamacare subsidies .

'' the drama of that exchange overshadowed the two-hour debate that encapsulated a broad array of policy debates , and a clear divide on the stage between candidates like sanders and warren who want to see the party veer in a more leftist direction with `` medicare-for-all '' and the disappearance of private health insurance , and more moderate candidates like former colorado gov. john hickenlooper and colorado sen. michael bennet who worry that the democrats ' shift to left will endanger the parties chances of retaking the white house .

the origin of the discipline of developmental cognitive neuroscience can be traced back to conference held in philadelphia in 1989 co-funded by nichd & nimh , organized by adele diamond , that started the process of developmental psychologists , cognitive scientists , and neuroscientists talking with one another . to bridge the communication gaps , researchers were invited from different fields who were either using the same experimental paradigms to study the same behaviors or were investigating related scientific questions in complementary ways -- though they were unaware of one another 's work . they used different words to talk about their work and had different ways of thinking about it , but the concrete , observable behaviors , and the precise experimental conditions under which those behaviors occurred , served to make translation possible . participants were a small who 's who of leaders in developmental science , behavioral neuroscience , and cognitive science . source : it was n't until recently -lsb- when ? -rsb- that bilingualism had been accepted as a contributing factor to cognitive development . there have been a number of studies showing how bilingualism contributes to the executive function of the brain , which is the main center at which cognitive development happens . according to bialystok in `` bilingualism and the development of executive function : the role of attention '' , children who are bilingual , have to actively filter through the two different languages to select the one they need to use , which in turn makes the development stronger in that center . source : the medical school and hospital were renamed the duke university medical center in 1957 . the first african american student was admitted to the duke university school of medicine in 1963 . in 1969 , the first recorded studies of human 's abilities to function and work at pressures equal to a 1,000-foot -lrb- 300 m -rrb- deep sea dive were conducted . -lsb- 3 -rsb- in the 1990s , duke geneticists invented a three-minute test to screen newborns for over 30 metabolic diseases at once .

after 24 hectic hours , congress was back where it started tuesday night -- with republicans and democrats in the senate near a deal to end to the u.s. budget standoff , while house republicans ca n't agree among themselves . meanwhile the u.s. government is creeping closer to potentially defaulting on its debt , something the treasury department says will happen thursday if there 's no pact to hike the nation 's borrowing limit . to this point , the wall street bond-rating firm fitch has warned of a downgrade of gold-plated u.s. bonds , citing the default risk from `` political brinkmanship . '' the economic nightmare from the possible debt default could compound the pain tied to the ongoing partial government shutdown , which enters its 16th day on wednesday . source : president barack obama indicated a willingness wednesday to agree to a short-term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit , if republicans will accept it , a democratic lawmaker told cnn . the president signaled more `` give '' to the idea of a six-week deal to hike the debt ceiling during a private white house meeting with house democrats , said the lawmaker , who spoke on condition of anonymity . the revelation comes amid a stalemate that has republicans trying to use spending and debt limit deadlines as leverage to wring concessions from obama and democrats . the result of the political standoff has been a partial government shutdown that is in its second week and fears of a possible u.s. default on its debt that economists warn could cause another recession . source : the night before the rescheduled vote , president trump , in a final effort to negotiate with those opposing the bill , announced to the house republicans that the vote the following day would be their only chance to repeal the affordable care act , a goal long sought after by republicans in congress . -lsb- 77 -rsb- -lsb- 78 -rsb- the following morning the bill was brought to the house floor after being approved by the house rules committee for four hours of debate preceding the vote , which was expected in the afternoon . -lsb- 79 -rsb- it was reported that a couple hours before the expected vote , ryan made a sudden visit to the white house to meet with trump , in which ryan told trump that the bill did not have enough votes to pass in the house . -lsb- 80 -rsb- shortly after the time of the expected vote it was announced that the republicans were withdrawing the ahca from consideration , a decision made after ryan met with trump .

president donald trump is privately striking a less agitated tone on the russia investigation , sources say , even insisting he 'll soon be cleared in writing . but his new approach has some allies worried he 's not taking the threat of the probe seriously enough . trump has spent much of his first year in office so enraged by the federal investigation into russian meddling in last year 's election that lawmakers who work with him tried to avoid the issue entirely and his friends worried that trump might rashly fire the special counsel . but in recent weeks , trump has privately seemed less frustrated about the investigation , according to multiple sources who have spoken with the president . source : president donald trump 's private lawyers are slated to meet with special counsel robert mueller and members of his team as soon as next week for what the president 's team considers an opportunity to gain a clearer understanding of the next steps in mueller 's probe , according to sources familiar with the matter . while the lawyers have met with mueller 's team before and might again , the sources believe the upcoming meeting has greater significance because it comes after the completion of interviews of white house personnel requested by the special counsel and after all requested documents have been turned over . mueller could still request more documents and additional interviews . no request to interview the president or the vice president has been made , sources tell cnn . source : the white house repeated saturday that president donald trump has no intentions of firing department of justice special counsel robert mueller amid fresh speculation from a congresswoman that he would be doing so . `` as the white house has consistently said for months , there is no consideration of firing the special counsel , '' ty cobb , the white house special counsel , told cnn in a statement . cobb 's statement came in response to comments by california democratic rep. jackie speier , who repeated concerns friday that trump would fire mueller . `` i believe that the president wants all of this shut down , '' she speculated during an appearance on kqed in california .
the pug is a breed of dog with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly , short-muzzled face , and curled tail . the breed has a fine , glossy coat that comes in a variety of colours , most often fawn or black , and a compact square body with well-developed muscles . pugs were brought from china to europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in western europe by the house of orange of the netherlands , and the house of stuart . in the united kingdom , in the nineteenth century , queen victoria developed a passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of the royal family . source : pugs are one of several breeds that are more susceptible than other dogs to demodectic mange , also known as `` demodex '' . this condition is caused when parasitic mites , that are often present in a dog 's skin without causing symptoms , are allowed to do damage because their host has a weakened immune system . it is a problem for many young pugs , although not usually a major one , and is easily treatable , but some are especially susceptible and present with a systemic form of the condition . -lsb- 37 -rsb- this vulnerability is thought to be genetic and breeders will avoid producing puppies from adults who have this condition . source : pugs arrived in the united states during the nineteenth century and were soon making their way into the family home and the show ring . -lsb- 2 -rsb- the american kennel club recognized the breed in 1885 . the pug dog club of america was founded in 1931 and was recognized by the american kennel club that same year . in 1981 , the pug dhandys favorite woodchuck won the westminster kennel club dog show in the united states , the only pug to have won there since the show began in 1877 .

two steps forward , one step back . a surge of optimism on monday for a possible compromise to end the partial government shutdown and avoid a u.s. default as soon as this week got jolted by the sudden postponement of a white house meeting between president barack obama and congressional leaders . in a brief statement , the white house said the meeting announced earlier in the day was put on hold `` to allow leaders in the senate time to continue making important progress '' toward a solution . it was unclear if the development signaled a problem or was needed to give more time for talks between senate majority leader harry reid and his republican counterpart , mitch mcconnell , to finish an agreement that could win approval in the senate and the house . source : president barack obama and house speaker john boehner both want talks to continue on ending the partial government shutdown and avoiding a possible debt default -- a welcome development after weeks of acrimony , if not proof a breakthrough is near . spokesman for both leaders , who were trading pointed barbs until a few days ago , issued statements after a friday afternoon phone call , that `` we should all keep talking .

following the real breakaway of egypt from british colonialism in 1952 -lrb- a success for mb -rrb- , the organization had to focus on a new political goal . that goal was the establishment of an egyptian government ruled by sharia law -lrb- ghattas 1 -rrb- . in the wake of the egyptian revolution of 2011 , the muslim brotherhood had been vocal about its support of the overthrow of then longtime president hosni mubarak , in favor of islamist president mohamed morsi , which was eventually replaced by abdel fattah el-sisi -lrb- supreme commander of the egyptian armed forces -rrb- . considering the information that has been gathered about the muslim brotherhood 's origins and its long term goals in egypt and in the region -lrb- middle east and north african region -rrb- , the idea that the egyptian revolution was not a spontaneous civil demonstration but a well-planned and orchestrated move to change egypt 's political structure , in line of course of the muslim brotherhood 's long term plan to install a sunni islamist government in egypt . source : clashes broke out in downtown cairo on tuesday between supporters of deposed egyptian president mohamed morsy and those opposed to his rule , leaving at least one person dead , state-run media reported . the violence came more than a month after the military ousted morsy , which sent tens of thousands of his supporters -- primarily members of the muslim brotherhood -- into the streets . they have been staging daily sit-ins since . egypt explained : 6 key questions the fighting broke out in front of the ministry of religious endowments in the heavily populated giza neighborhood , leaving one dead and 11 wounded , state-run ahram online reported , citing unnamed security sources . source : a day after at least 580 died amid ferocious clashes between protesters and security forces , egypt 's government defended its actions in the face of sweeping condemnation -- insisting its troops fired in self-defense and were n't even responsible for many of the deaths . the violence stirred world leaders , some of them longtime egyptian allies , to sharply criticize the cairo government for going too far in its treatment of supporters of ousted president mohamed morsy , whom the military forced out of office several weeks ago . in addition to the hundreds killed , the egyptian health ministry reports more than 4,000 were injured wednesday in clashes that began when security forces moved in to break up protesters demonstrating in support of morsy , according to state tv . there is no disputing the violence was egypt 's worst since the 2011 revolution that ousted president hosni mubarak .

after riding into south carolina on a wave of seeming inevitability , mitt romney was dealt a series of blows here that culminated with a disappointing second-place finish in the state 's high-stakes primary . even before losing to newt gingrich by a large margin saturday night , romney 's team began to look ahead to florida , where the campaign hoped a big lead in fundraising and on-the-ground organization could help him regain his momentum . in a speech to supporters here on saturday , the former massachusetts governor hit his rivals harder than in any other high-profile speech he has given this cycle . romney takes a setback and second place in s.c. `` we can not defeat -lsb- president barack obama -rsb- with a candidate who has joined in that very assault on free enterprise , '' he said in a clear assault on gingrich , who has criticized romney 's private sector experience at a private equity firm . source : editor 's note : watch in america 's documentary about the race to capture the latino vote on cnn in october 2012 . by rafael romo , cnn senior latin american affairs editor chihuahua , mexico -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- in the town of colonia juarez , where houses look much like homes in the american southwest , there lives a family named romney . mitt romney 's great-grandfather led the first group of mormons to the state of chihuahua to flee religious persecution . mitt romney 's father george -- an auto executive , and michigan governor who also ran for president in the united states -- was born nearby , in a town called colonia dublan . source : with the release of his tax figures for the past two years , republican presidential hopeful mitt romney may be hoping to move the political debate on to other matters . the documents reveal he made $ 42.7 million over the past two years and paid $ 6.2 million in taxes , with an effective federal income tax rate of just under 14 % . but will the release of the figures do more to help him or harm him with american voters , many of whom are hurting in the long economic downturn , as he heads into florida 's primary and beyond ? romney 's decision to make the figures public follows challenges to do so from rival republicans -- among them former speaker newt gingrich , who has released his tax figures -- and his own disappointing showing in the south carolina primary .
secretary of state john kerry , defense secretary chuck hagel and joint chiefs of staff chairman gen. martin dempsey answered questions for 3 1/2 hours on tuesday at the first congressional hearing on president barack obama 's request for authorization to launch a military strike against syria over chemical weapons . the hearing by the senate foreign relations committee , which kerry used to chair , covered a range of issues about the proposed u.s. military response raised by legislators and people across the country . here are five things we learned from it : live blog of the hearing 1 -rrb- proposed senate resolution the top democrat and republican on the senate foreign relations committee worked out a joint proposal for authorizing military action in syria . democrat robert menendez , chairman of the panel , said he and bob corker , its ranking member , believe the plan `` reflects the will and concerns of democrats and republicans alike . '' source : president barack obama said wednesday that the world set a red line against chemical weapons use that he now seeks to apply to syria , while a senate committee approved a resolution authorizing the u.s. military attack that he is planning . by a 10-7 vote , the senate foreign relations committee passed the resolution that authorizes a limited military response , giving obama an initial victory in his push to win congressional approval . the measure now goes to the full senate for debate next week . the democratic-led chamber is expected to pass it , but the outcome is less clear in the republican-led house where top diplomatic and military officials made their case on wednesday for action . source : as a russian proposal to strip syria of its chemical weapons began to take shape , the white house eased off the gas on tuesday in its drive for congressional approval to strike the middle eastern country . president barack obama asked congressional leaders to delay votes on authorizing military action in syria while the diplomatic process works itself out , the president announced in a prime-time speech to americans . obama said he will continue talks with russian president vladimir putin and will send secretary of state john kerry to meet with his russian counterpart , russian foreign minister sergey lavrov , in geneva , switzerland , on thursday . the united states will also give u.n. inspectors the opportunity to report their findings about the suspected chemical attack that occurred august 21 , the president said .

'' source : the president and the vice president are elected together in a presidential election . -lsb- 17 -rsb- it is an indirect election , with the winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the electoral college . in modern times , voters in each state select a slate of electors from a list of several slates designated by different parties or candidates , and the electors typically promise in advance to vote for the candidates of their party -lrb- whose names of the presidential candidates usually appear on the ballot rather than those of the individual electors -rrb- . the winner of the election is the candidate with at least 270 electoral college votes . source : since 2002 , several cities have adopted instant-runoff voting in their elections . voters rank the candidates in order of preference rather than voting for a single candidate . if a candidate secures more than half of votes cast , that candidate wins . otherwise , the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated .

although no immediate announcement was made of the second continental congress 's vote for independence -- and so the bell could not have rung on july 4 , 1776 , related to that vote -- bells were rung on july 8 to mark the reading of the united states declaration of independence . while there is no contemporary account of the liberty bell ringing , most historians believe it was one of the bells rung . after american independence was secured , the bell fell into relative obscurity until , in the 1830s , the bell was adopted as a symbol by abolitionist societies , who dubbed it the `` liberty bell '' . source : michigan remained fairly reliably republican at the presidential level for much of the 20th century . it was part of greater new england , the northern tier of states settled chiefly by migrants from new england who carried their culture with them . the state was one of only a handful to back wendell willkie over franklin roosevelt in 1940 , and supported thomas e. dewey in his losing bid against harry s. truman in 1948 . michigan went to the democrats in presidential elections during the 1960s and voted for the republican candidate in every election from 1972 to 1988 . source : in contrast , the state supported democratic candidates in each presidential election from 1992 to 2012 . in 2012 , barack obama carried the state over mitt romney , winning michigan 's 16 electoral votes with 54 % of the vote . michigan 's two us senators are both democrats , while republicans held a majority of the state 's us house seats from 2011 to 2019 . as a result of the 2018 elections , the house delegation became evenly divided between democrats and republicans at seven members each .

'' copernicus was aware of the practice of exchanging bad coins for good ones and melting down the latter or sending them abroad , and he seems to have drawn up some notes on this subject while he was at olsztyn in 1519 . he made them the basis of a report which he presented to the prussian diet held in 1522 , attending the session with his friend tiedemann giese to represent his chapter . copernicus 's monetae cudendae ratio was an enlarged , latin version of that report , setting forth a general theory of money for the 1528 diet . source : in 1921 , outside winden , two men are building a passage into the cave that would later be used as the portal . one of them , a young noah , kills the other with a pick-axe on suspicions that he `` lost -lsb- his -rsb- faith '' . the younger noah is guided by his older self , a member of a group of time travellers called sic mundus , led by the disfigured and mysterious adam , who tells the older noah to retrieve the missing pages of claudia 's diary in preparation for an `` apocalypse '' that will occur on 27 june 2020 . source : born to henry and donna tiedemann , -lsb- 4 -rsb- mark w. tiedemann grew up an only child . he wrote several short stories , a few of which he submitted to major sf magazines of the day such as galaxy , worlds of if , the magazine of fantasy & science fiction , though none were accepted for publication . -lsb- 5 -rsb-

by the time president barack obama walked into a packed auditorium at the white house monday , his economic message for the day had already been eclipsed by the unfolding tragedy at the washington navy yard . and that was before the city 's mayor announced that 12 people and the gunman had been shot dead . as the white house shifted again into disaster-response mode , the president 's already-full plate got a lot fuller . and while the executive branch is more than capable of keeping multiple balls in the air , the topics obama has been looking to push for months are again receding into the background . source : the white house defended president barack obama from criticism that he was tone deaf in his reaction to the mass shootings at washington navy yard . obama : shooting a ` cowardly ' act for a second straight day , white house press secretary jay carney faced questions about a monday afternoon event that occurred as the situation at the navy yard was still unfolding . obama touched on the tragedy before forcefully criticizing conservative republicans who are threatening to shut down the government . obama pressures conservative republicans mccain to house republicans : do n't shut down government `` i understand that some republicans are trying to make something of this , '' carney said on tuesday in response to a question from cnn senior white house correspondent jim acosta . source : the national trauma inflicted by the massacre of 20 children and six adults at sandy hook elementary school prompted an emotional and fierce debate on gun control , but the drive this spring for stricter limits led by president barack obama fell short in washington . by summer , the issue had mostly faded on the political stage . it was replaced by troubling disclosures around national security leaks and u.s. surveillance , violent political turmoil in egypt , alleged chemical weapons use in syria , and another looming federal budget showdown . then , an armed , 34-year-old former veteran shattered the late summer calm on monday when he shot up the washington navy yard , killing 12 people before , he , too , died .

the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical , geographical , and political context in which it is used . american is derived from america , a term originally denoting all of the new world -lrb- also called the americas -rrb- . in some expressions , it retains this pan-american sense , but its usage has evolved over time and , for various historical reasons , the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america . in modern english , american generally refers to persons or things related to the united states of america ; among native english speakers this usage is almost universal , with any other use of the term requiring specification . source : the boston red sox are an american professional baseball team based in boston , massachusetts . they compete in major league baseball -lrb- mlb -rrb- as a member club of the american league -lrb- al -rrb- east division . the team have won nine world series championships , tied for the third-most of any mlb team , and they have played in 13 . their most recent world series appearance and win was in 2018 . source : the middle east is a transcontinental region which includes western asia -lrb- although generally excluding the caucasus -rrb- and all of egypt -lrb- which is mostly in north africa -rrb- . the term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term near east -lrb- as opposed to the far east -rrb- beginning in the early 20th century . the broader concept of the `` greater middle east '' -lrb- or middle east and north africa -rrb- also adds the maghreb , sudan , djibouti , somalia , afghanistan , pakistan , and sometimes even central asia and transcaucasia into the region . the term `` middle east '' has led to some confusion over its changing definitions .

the democratic party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the united states , along with its main rival , the republican party . tracing its heritage back to thomas jefferson and james madison 's democratic-republican party , the modern-day democratic party was founded around 1828 by supporters of andrew jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party.in its early years , the party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . since franklin d. roosevelt and his new deal coalition in the 1930s , the democratic party has promoted a social liberal platform . well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and southern conservative-populist wings ; following the new deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the south . source : head coach tim sheens took the decision not to throw carney into the deep end on his début , -lrb- due to his lack of game-time over the previous months -rrb- , to allow him time to adjust and to get himself well adapt to his new surroundings . source : the democrats -lrb- portuguese : democratas , dem -rrb- is a political party in brazil . it was founded in 1985 under the name of liberal front party -lrb- partido da frente liberal , pfl -rrb- from a dissidence of the defunct pds , successor to the arena , the official party during the military dictatorship of 1964 -- 1985 . it changed to its current name in 2007 . the original name reflected the party 's support of free market policies , rather than the identification with international liberal parties .
in 1936 , his new organization achieved national recognition by correctly predicting , from the replies of only 50,000 respondents , that franklin roosevelt would defeat alf landon in the u.s. presidential election . this was in direct contradiction to the widely-respected literary digest magazine whose poll based on over two million returned questionnaires predicted that landon would be the winner . not only did gallup get the election right , he correctly predicted the results of the literary digest poll , as well using a random sample smaller than theirs but chosen to match it . source : in 2012 , gallup 's final election survey had mitt romney at 49 % and barack obama at 48 % , compared to the final election results showing obama with 51.1 % to romney 's 47.2 % . -lsb- 49 -rsb- poll analyst nate silver found that gallup 's results were the least accurate of the 23 major polling firms silver analyzed , having the highest incorrect average of being 7.2 points away from the final result . -lsb- 50 -rsb- frank newport , the editor-in-chief of gallup , responded to the criticism by stating that gallup simply makes an estimate of the national popular vote rather than predicting the winner and that their final poll was within the statistical margin of error . newport also criticized analysts such as silver who aggregate and analyze other people 's polls , stating that `` it 's much easier , cheaper , and mostly less risky to focus on aggregating and analyzing others ' polls . source : in 2012 , gallup incorrectly predicted that mitt romney would win the 2012 u.s. presidential election . -lsb- 33 -rsb- following the results of the election , gallup spent six months reviewing its methodology . -lsb- 33 -rsb- the company concluded that its methodology was flawed as it made too few phone calls in eastern and pacific time zones , overestimated the white vote , and relied on listed landline phones that skewed the sample to an older demographic . -lsb- 33 -rsb-
the latest fighters in the opioid addiction epidemic are n't addicts-turned-activists , cops or even addiction counselors . they are health insurance companies . cigna , which insures about 14 million americans , has become the latest major health insurance company to take measures to combat the staggering opioid addiction numbers and deaths , targeting what many feel is feeding the problem : overprescribing of prescription painkillers such as oxycodone , hydrocodone and morphine . companies such as aetna and blue cross blue shield have taken similar measures over the past several years to prevent deaths and keep addiction numbers from going up . source : california 's health insurance exchange estimates that its obamacare premiums may rise 8 % on average next year , which would end two consecutive years of more modest 4 % increases . the projected rate increase in california , included in the exchange 's proposed annual budget , comes amid growing nationwide concern about insurers seeking double-digit premium hikes in the health law 's insurance marketplaces . any increases in california , a closely watched state in the health law rollout , are sure to draw intense scrutiny during a presidential election . republicans are quick to seize on rate hikes as further proof that president barack obama 's signature law is n't doing enough to hold down health care costs for the average consumer . source : prince and michael jackson . they were born the same year and rose to colossal fame in the 1980s . each defined a sound for a generation . they were both committed musicians who helped to integrate the world of mainstream music videos .

most cabinet ministers are from the house of commons rather than the house of lords . in particular , all prime ministers since 1902 have been members of the lower house . -lsb- 58 -rsb- -lrb- alec douglas-home , who became prime minister in 1963 whilst still an earl , disclaimed his peerage and was elected to the commons soon after his term began . -rrb- in recent history , it has been very rare for major cabinet positions -lrb- except lord chancellor and leader of the house of lords -rrb- to have been filled by peers . source : cantor met his wife , diana marcy fine , on a blind date ; and they were married in 1989 . -lsb- 10 -rsb- -lsb- 25 -rsb- -lsb- 84 -rsb- they have three children , evan , jenna , and michael , and live in wyndham , an unincorporated suburban community near richmond -lrb- though cantor was listed in the house roll as `` r-richmond '' -rrb- . contrary to her husband , she is a lifelong democrat , and is pro-choice and supports same-sex marriage . -lsb- 85 -rsb- source : by contrast , party leaders of the united states senate have often ascended to their position despite relatively few years of experience in that chamber , -lsb- citation needed -rsb- such as lyndon b. johnson , william f. knowland , and bill frist . former house majority leader eric cantor also had a comparatively quick rise to the post and was the youngest house majority leader in american history . -lsb- citation needed -rsb-
during the second presidential campaign debate with president barack obama in october 2012 , obama said that `` gov. romney feels comfortable having politicians in washington decide the health care choices that women are making . ... -lsb- gov. romney -rsb- suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage .

historically , many states , prior to achieving statehood , have sent non-voting delegates to the house . while their role has fluctuated over the years , today they have many of the same privileges as voting members , have a voice in committees , and can introduce bills on the floor , but can not vote on the ultimate passage of bills . presently , the district of columbia and the five inhabited u.s. territories each elect a delegate . a seventh delegate , representing the cherokee nation , has been formally proposed but has not yet been seated . source : the parliament act 1911 effectively abolished the power of the house of lords to reject legislation , or to amend it in a way unacceptable to the house of commons : most bills could be delayed for no more than three parliamentary sessions or two calendar years . it was not meant to be a permanent solution ; more comprehensive reforms were planned . neither party , however , pursued the matter with much enthusiasm , and the house of lords remained primarily hereditary . the parliament act 1949 reduced the delaying power of the house of lords further to two sessions or one year . source : the role of a revising chamber is to scrutinise legislation that may have been drafted over-hastily in the lower house and to suggest amendments that the lower house may nevertheless reject if it wishes to . an example is the british house of lords . under the parliament acts 1911 and 1949 , the house of lords can no longer prevent the passage of most bills , but it must be given an opportunity to debate them and propose amendments , and can thereby delay the passage of a bill with which it disagrees . bills can only be delayed for up to one year before the commons can use the parliament act , although economic bills can only be delayed for one month .
the ford model t -lrb- colloquially known as the tin lizzie , leaping lena , jitney or flivver -rrb- is an automobile produced by ford motor company from october 1 , 1908 , to may 26 , 1927 . it is generally regarded as the first affordable automobile , the car that opened travel to the common middle-class american ; some of this was because of ford 's efficient fabrication , including assembly line production instead of individual hand crafting.the ford model t was named the most influential car of the 20th century in the 1999 car of the century competition , ahead of the bmc mini , citroën ds , and volkswagen type 1 . ford 's model t was successful not only because it provided inexpensive transportation on a massive scale , but also because the car signified innovation for the rising middle class and became a powerful symbol of the united states age of modernization . with 16.5 million sold , it stood eighth on the top ten list of most sold cars of all time as of 2012 . although automobiles had been produced from the 1880s they were still mostly scarce , expensive , and often unreliable at the model t 's introduction in 1908 . source : on january 3 , 2017 , ford ceo mark fields announced that in a `` vote of confidence '' because of the pro-business climate being fostered in part by president-elect donald trump , ford has cancelled plans to invest $ 1.6 billion in a new plant in mexico to manufacture the ford focus . the ford focus will now be manufactured in the existing plant in mexico . instead , fields announced that ford will be investing $ 700 million in michigan , which it plans to use to create 700 new jobs . -lsb- 49 -rsb- also in 2017 , ford began development of a new mixed-use urban campus in the corktown neighborhood of detroit , with its purchase , renovation and occupation of the factory at michigan and rosa parks . source : the model c , the first car to be produced in canada , rolled out of the factory in late september 1904 . the company could produce two cars at a time and in its first full year of production , the company was able to produce 117 automobiles . the company 's first export sales were to calcutta , india . ford is still an important manufacturing enterprise in windsor .
in november 2008 , two things led to an explosion in popularity of the obama comic book character . one of obama 's advisers gave an interview to journalist jon swaine of the daily telegraph titled , `` barack obama : the 50 facts you might not know . '' in the interview , it emerged that obama collects `` spider-man and conan the barbarian . '' -lsb- 3 -rsb- then later that month , on november 4 , 2008 , obama became the first african-american to be elected president of the united states . source : the presidency of barack obama began at noon est on january 20 , 2009 , when barack obama was inaugurated as the 44th president of the united states , and ended on january 20 , 2017 . obama , a democrat from illinois , took office following a decisive victory over republican john mccain in the 2008 presidential election . four years later , in the 2012 election , he defeated republican mitt romney to win re-election . he was the first african american president , the first multiracial president , the first non-white president , and the first president to have been born in hawaii . source : the 2008 presidential campaign of barack obama , then junior united states senator from illinois , was announced on february 10 , 2007 , in springfield , illinois . -lsb- 1 -rsb- after winning a majority of delegates in the democratic primaries of 2008 , on august 23 , leading up to the convention , the campaign announced that senator joe biden of delaware would be the vice presidential nominee . -lsb- 2 -rsb- at the 2008 democratic national convention on august 27 , barack obama was formally selected as the democratic party nominee for president of the united states in 2008 . -lsb- 3 -rsb- he was the first african american in history to be nominated on a major party ticket .
in 1849 , walker stated in his annual report that several federal offices were placed in departments with which they had little to do . he noted that the general land office had little to do with the treasury and also highlighted the indian affairs office , part of the department of war , and the patent office , part of the department of state . walker argued that these and other bureaus should be brought together in a new department of the interior . -lsb- citation needed -rsb- a bill authorizing its creation of the department passed the house of representatives on february 15 , 1849 , and spent just over two weeks in the senate . source : in september 1789 , additional legislation changed the name of the agency to the department of state and assigned to it a variety of domestic duties . these responsibilities grew to include management of the united states mint , keeper of the great seal of the united states , and the taking of the census . president george washington signed the new legislation on september 15 . -lsb- 6 -rsb- most of these domestic duties were eventually transferred to various new federal departments and agencies established during the 19th century . source : the united states department of the interior -lrb- doi -rrb- is a federal executive department of the u.s. government . it is responsible for the management and conservation of most federal lands and natural resources , and the administration of programs relating to native americans , alaska natives , native hawaiians , territorial affairs , and insular areas of the united states . about 75 % of federal public land is managed by the department , with most of the remainder managed by the united states department of agriculture 's united states forest service . -lsb- 3 -rsb-
new orleans agreed to commission the waterworks project in 1811 , although latrobe was not ready to take on the project immediately and faced financial problems in securing enough investors for the project . his work on the united states capitol was completed shortly before the war of 1812 started , ending his source of steady income . during the war latrobe unsuccessfully tried several wartime schemes to make money , including some steamboat projects . in 1814 , latrobe partnered with robert fulton in a steamship venture based at pittsburgh . source : in 2009 , play was reported to have reunited , without original member anna sundstrand . two weeks before they were scheduled to go back into the studio , member rosanna munter decided not to continue with the group , saying in a statement she `` has worked hard on my own music , and i want to give it the chance to be heard .

dolphins have few marine enemies . some species or specific populations have none , making them apex predators . for most of the smaller species of dolphins , only a few of the larger sharks , such as the bull shark , dusky shark , tiger shark and great white shark , are a potential risk , especially for calves . -lsb- 121 -rsb- some of the larger dolphin species , especially orcas -lrb- killer whales -rrb- , may also prey on smaller dolphins , but this seems rare . source : oceanic dolphins or delphinidae are a widely distributed family of dolphins that live in the sea . thirty extant species are described . they include several big species whose common names contain `` whale '' rather than `` dolphin '' , such as the killer whale and the pilot whales . delphinidae is a family within the superfamily delphinoidea , which also includes the porpoises -lrb- phocoenidae -rrb- and the monodontidae -lrb- beluga whale and narwhal -rrb- . source : the killer whale or orca -lrb- orcinus orca -rrb- is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family , of which it is the largest member . killer whales have a diverse diet , although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey . some feed exclusively on fish , while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and other species of dolphin . they have been known to attack baleen whale calves , and even adult whales .
one criticism of the analogy is that while ponzi schemes and social security have similar structures -lrb- in particular , a sustainability problem when the number of new people paying in is declining -rrb- , they have different transparencies . in the case of a ponzi scheme , the fact that there is no return-generating mechanism other than contributions from new entrants is obscured -lsb- 161 -rsb- whereas social security payouts have always been openly underwritten by incoming tax revenue and the interest on the treasury bonds held by or for the social security system . -lsb- 162 -rsb- the sudden loss of confidence resulting in a collapse of a conventional ponzi scheme when the scheme 's true nature is revealed is unlikely to occur in the case of the social security system . -lsb- citation needed -rsb- private sector ponzi schemes are also vulnerable to collapse because they can not compel new entrants , whereas participation in the social security program is a condition for joining the u.s. labor force . source : a side effect of the social security program in the united states has been the near-universal adoption of the program 's identification number , the social security number , as the de facto u.s. national identification number . the social security number , or ssn , is issued pursuant to section 205 -lrb- c -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- of the social security act , codified as 42 u.s.c. § 405 -lrb- c -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- . the government originally stated that the ssn would not be a means of identification , -lsb- 91 -rsb- but currently a multitude of u.s. entities use the social security number as a personal identifier . source : the social security administration does not reuse social security numbers . it has issued over 450 million since the start of the program , and at a use rate of about 5.5 million per year . it says it has enough to last several generations without reuse or changing the number of digits . -lsb- 39 -rsb- however , there have been instances where multiple individuals have been inadvertently assigned the same social security number .
the white house office of the press secretary deals with the daily press needs of the president and manages their relationship with the news media . -lsb- 1 -rsb- the office of the press secretary deals with the president their relationship while the office of communications deals with strategic planning of how the president 's statements will be released to the public . -lsb- 1 -rsb- the leader of this office must be stable and usually serves for a relatively long amount of time . -lsb- 1 -rsb- in the 89 years that the press secretary has been a job , only 31 people have held the position . source : the white house press secretary is a senior white house official whose primary responsibility is to act as spokesperson for the executive branch of the united states government administration , especially with regard to the president , senior aides and executives , as well as government policies . the press secretary is responsible for collecting information about actions and events within the president 's administration and issues the administration 's reactions to developments around the world . the press secretary interacts with the media , and deals with the white house press corps on a daily basis , generally in a daily press briefing . the press secretary serves by the appointment and at the pleasure of the president of the united states ; the office does not require the advice and consent of the u.s. senate , though because of the frequent briefings given to the media , who in turn inform the public , the position is still a very prominent non-cabinet post . source : on july 21 , 2017 , spicer announced his intention to resign as white house press secretary . he made his decision known immediately after president trump appointed financier anthony scaramucci as white house communications director . in the weeks leading up to the resignation announcement , spicer had sought `` a more strategic communications role '' in the white house . -lsb- 15 -rsb- trump had reportedly been dissatisfied for some time with spicer 's performance as white house press secretary .

what looked last week like a game of political hot potato has become a high-stakes game of chicken , with continued operation of the federal government and possible wider impact on the overall economy hanging in the balance . in a move that makes a shutdown appear very likely , house republicans approved a spending plan early sunday morning that would delay obamacare for a year and repeal its tax on medical devices . the temporary budget resolution now goes back to the senate , where democrats have consistently said any changes to president barack obama 's signature health care law would be a deal-killer . on top of that , obama has already issued a veto threat . source : house republicans pushed through a spending plan early sunday morning that would delay obamacare for a year and repeal its tax on medical devices . the vote makes the chances of a government shutdown tuesday increasingly likely . that 's because passage of the amendments sends a temporary budget resolution back to the senate , where democrats vow to again block the anti-obamacare amendments . president barack obama has added a veto threat to that position . source : with a possible government shutdown in five days , house speaker john boehner on thursday signaled a shift in republican tactics with the focus now on negotiating a compromise on raising the federal debt ceiling next month instead of a short-term spending plan now . he and other gop leaders called on president barack obama to negotiate an agreement with them to increase how much the government can borrow to pay its bills in exchange for concessions they seek such as delaying the implementation of obamacare . however , obama later made clear that he rejected any political bartering on the debt ceiling . `` i will not negotiate on anything when it comes to the full faith and credit of the united states of america , '' he said .
on january 6 , 2015 , brat was one of 25 house republicans to vote against john boehner 's reelection as speaker of the united states house of representatives . boehner , who needed at least 205 votes , was reelected with 216 votes . -lsb- 55 -rsb- though brat supported boehner earlier , he reversed his support after the house gop leadership did not allow him to make an amendment to block a controversial executive order signed by president barack obama in a spending bill . -lsb- 56 -rsb- source : senator dick durbin -lrb- d-ill . -rrb- joins soledad this morning to discuss the outlook for president obama 's second term . on the negativity of glenn thrush 's comments to politico , hours after obama 's victory speech , he says , `` i believe that for the american people the campaign ended last night . the question is , on capitol hill , will the campaigns end today ? the solution to americans ' problems , regardless of who won last night , was both parties on capitol hill working together .

it is not known how long murdoch will remain as news corporation 's ceo . for a while the american cable television entrepreneur john malone was the second-largest voting shareholder in news corporation after murdoch himself , potentially undermining the family 's control . in 2007 , the company announced that it would sell certain assets and give cash to malone 's company in exchange for its stock . in 2007 , the company issued murdoch 's older children voting stock . source : murdoch moved to britain and rapidly became a major force there after his acquisitions of the news of the world , and the sun in 1969 and the times and the sunday times in 1981 , which he bought from the thomson family . both takeovers further reinforced his growing reputation as a ruthless and cunning business operator . his takeover of the times aroused great hostility among traditionalists , who feared he would take it `` downmarket . '' this led directly to the founding of the independent in 1986 as an alternative quality daily . source : on june 28 , 2012 , rupert murdoch announced that news corporation 's publishing operations would be spun off to form a new , publicly traded company . -lsb- 4 -rsb- -lsb- 5 -rsb- murdoch stated that performing this split would `` unlock the true value of both companies and their distinct assets , enabling investors to benefit from the separate strategic opportunities resulting from more focused management of each division '' . the move also came in the wake of a series of scandals that had damaged the reputation of multiple news corporation-owned properties . -lsb- 4 -rsb- -lsb- 6 -rsb- robert james thomson , editor of the wall street journal , was announced as the initial chief operating officer for the company ; while murdoch would not serve as ceo , he remained chairman and a shareholder of the new news corp. -lsb- 4 -rsb- -lsb- 7 -rsb- thomson promised that the new company would `` cultivate a start-up sensibility even though we already work for the world 's most established and prestigious diversified media and information services company '' , and would emphasize building new business models around its properties and content .
as his white house continued to struggle to get its story straight regarding the firing of fbi director james comey and the unwanted photo-op of the president and russian ambassador sergey kislyak on wednesday , donald trump took time out to troll longtime nemesis rosie o'donnell . on thursday afternoon , trump retweeted a two-word tweet the actress sent in december 2016 that read : `` fire comey .

donald trump descended the famous escalator in trump tower one year ago thursday to launch a presidential campaign that seemed so outrageous , provocative and unconventional that it was dismissed as reality television . a year later , trump is the presumptive republican nominee . his showman style -- with its brass-knuckled tactics , defiance of decorum and itchy-twitter-finger approach -- has created a new brand of politics that is entirely his own . now he is testing the limits of his persona during the general election campaign . source : republican donors who are still willing to give to donald trump are increasingly uneasy -- not just about the constant controversy surrounding the presumptive gop nominee but also the perceived total lack of infrastructure related to his nascent fundraising operation . the list of problems , according to donors and party officials , is both long and not easy to fix over the course of a short period . in many ways , it 's only natural . trump rolled through the primary haranguing the donor community , including some of the party 's top money men and women by name , as he pledged to self-fund his campaign . source : throughout his 2016 presidential campaign and his presidency , trump has repeatedly accused the press of intentionally misinterpreting his words and of being biased , calling them `` fake news media '' and `` the enemy of the people '' . -lsb- 314 -rsb- -lsb- 719 -rsb- in the campaign , trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage , elevating his standing in the republican primaries . -lsb- 317 -rsb- new york times writer amy chozick wrote in september 2018 that one of the reasons for trump 's appeal was his media dominance . to answer the question of why the u.s. public could not stop being enthralled by his actions , she wrote `` even in the so-called golden age of tv , mr. trump has n't just dominated water-cooler conversation ; he 's sucked the water right out , making all other entertainment from n.f.l.

'' source : donald trump has signed the pledge . the republican presidential front-runner met privately with republican national committee chairman reince priebus thursday afternoon , and soon after , came out to the lobby of trump tower to declare that he has signed a loyalty pledge . this means trump has promised to support the party 's eventual nominee -- whoever that may be -- and that he will not run as a third-party candidate . `` the best way for the republicans to win is if i win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up . source : republican leaders must be overjoyed ! donald trump has signed the `` loyalty pledge '' vowing that he will support the republican nominee in 2016 . i can understand why they are probably crazily high-fiving each other now . after all , polls have shown that if trump did run as an independent presidential candidate in 2016 , he would likely siphon off votes from the gop nominee and serve up a big , fat victory for the democrats .

president donald trump 's tweet on saturday about firing michael flynn from his position as national security adviser is garnering a lot of attention from critics -- with some calling it a possible admission of obstruction of justice . trump tweeted about flynn 's friday guilty plea , in which the former national security adviser said he lied to the fbi about conversations he had with russian ambassador to the united states sergey kislyak during the transition and disclosed that he is cooperating with special counsel robert mueller 's office . `` i had to fire general flynn because he lied to the vice president and the fbi , '' trump wrote . `` he has pled guilty to those lies . source : shortly after former trump national security adviser michael flynn pleaded guilty friday to lying to the fbi about conversations with russia 's ambassador , former fbi director james comey shared a justice-minded verse from the bible on twitter and instagram . '' ` but let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream , ' amos 5:24 , '' comey wrote , referring to the bible 's book of amos . comey tweeted the same biblical passage in november after president donald trump called the former fbi director a `` liar . '' comey , a united methodist and one-time sunday school teacher , said it 's his `` favorite scripture verse . '' source : special counsel robert mueller 's plea deal friday with president donald trump 's former national security adviser signaled that mueller is closing in on senior officials of the 2016 trump campaign , heightening the conflict between the two leading players in america 's post-election russia drama . trump tried to staunch the russia investigation on multiple fronts . an overriding question is whether the new revelations increase the chances that trump tries to get rid of mueller , as he did last may when he sacked fbi director james comey , who first led the investigation into possible trump campaign ties to russian interference in the election . or would the president attempt to get ahead of mueller by pardoning associates , including former trump national security adviser michael flynn , who on friday pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about conversations with russia 's ambassador and disclosed he is cooperating with mueller .

it looks like markets could start friday in the red and close out the week with a loss as uncertainty over the economic impact of political squabbling in washington continues to worry investors . u.s. stock futures were all lower . investors continue to fret over how washington will deal with a possible government shutdown and a debt ceiling that could keep the government from paying its bills . many expect congress will strike a last-minute deal to raise the debt limit , allowing the government to keep paying for things such as medicare and the military . source : there has n't been a government shutdown in more than 17 years , since the 28 days of budget stalemate in the clinton administration that cost more than $ 1 billion . now we hear dire warnings and sharpening rhetoric that another shutdown is possible and perhaps likely in less than two weeks when the current fiscal year ends . despite an escalating political imbroglio , the combination of how congress works and what politicians want makes the chances of a shutdown at the end of the month uncertain at best . in particular , a rift between republicans over how to proceed has heightened concerns of a shutdown in the short run , but remains a major reason why one is unlikely in the end . source : as the country spirals toward a possible government shutdown in less than a week , most americans , according to polls , are frustrated by the partisan stubbornness and do n't want that shutdown to happen . `` our country was founded on a great compromise , '' casey fos , a lawyer from new orleans suburb of covington , louisiana , tells cnn . in this showdown toward the shutdown , public opinion is a crucial factor , and the latest national surveys also suggest that democrats and republicans have numbers to bolster their arguments . shutdown showdown moves to senate a shutdown of the government would kick in if congress does n't hammer out a new spending plan by tuesday , the start of the new federal budget year .

pope francis , the current pope of the catholic church , succeeded pope benedict xvi in 2013 as the first pope from the americas , the first from the southern hemisphere , and the first pope from outside europe since the syrian gregory iii , who reigned in the 8th century . pope francis has been noted for his humility , emphasis on god 's mercy , concern for the poor and the environment , as well as his commitment to interfaith dialogue . he is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors . source : as pope , francis has repeatedly spoken about the need for the church to welcome and love all people , regardless of their sexual orientation . speaking about gay people in 2013 , he said that `` the key is for the church to welcome , not exclude and show mercy , not condemnation .

envy can be a painful emotion that can result from an unflattering social comparison of someone who is perceived to be a superior person . aristotle defined envy as the pain a person experiences at the sight of another person 's good fortune . while envy is seen to be negative , it is the driving force behind the `` keeping up with the joneses '' philosophy . this means that there is always something to work toward , and to never become complacent with life . source : john hallam was born , the son of a superintendent at london docklands , in 1941 in lisburn , county antrim , after the family were evacuated to northern ireland during the second world war . -lsb- 4 -rsb- on returning to england , he boarded at st albans school , before starting his working life in a london bank . despite having a talent for mathematics , he said he was sacked for getting the figures right without being able to explain how he did so . as a result , he ended up selling deckchairs on the south coast , where he eventually found acting work in repertory theatre . source : aristotle defined envy as pain at the sight of another 's good fortune , stirred by `` those who have what we ought to have .

after the release of a pennsylvania grand jury report on the decadeslong sexual abuse of more than 1,000 child victims by priests in six dioceses , there is horror and there are questions about what comes next . one question i 'm hearing and thinking about as a scholar of the catholic family is whether the report will lead catholic families or individuals to turn their backs on thousands of years of catholic teaching about human sexuality . even people who have close relationships with priests and bishops they have known and trusted for years might emotionally struggle with the idea that this church can continue to provide guidance on sexual morality . it 's not necessarily a logical response ; sexual abuse is a crime of power and exploitation . source : shaun dougherty , a survivor of childhood sexual abuse by a priest in pennsylvania , does n't have anything he 'd like to say to pope francis . `` what am i going to tell a pope ? '' he asked cnn 's erica hill wednesday morning , when she questioned if he had a message for the pontiff after the vatican declined to comment on the damning report about sexual abuse by priests and other clergy in the state . `` they 're supposed to tell me the morality , '' dougherty continued . source : a pennsylvania man reflected thursday on what he says two sexually abusive catholic priests `` stole '' from him -- and how his state 's lawmakers could stand up for survivors . `` they stole the most sacred thing that i had , and that was my catholic church , '' mike mcdonnell told cnn 's erica hill two days after the release of a damning grand jury report that shows more than 300 `` predator priests '' in six pennsylvania dioceses have been credibly accused of sexually abusing more than 1,000 child victims since the 1940s . `` an 11-year-old kid loved going to church with his parents . i could sing ` pange lingua ' in latin and in english , '' said mcdonnell , who publicly has accused and sued two priests in the diocese of philadelphia , which was not covered by the latest grand jury report .

tnt is valued partly because of its insensitivity to shock and friction , with reduced risk of accidental detonation compared to more sensitive explosives such as nitroglycerin . tnt melts at 80 °c -lrb- 176 °f -rrb- , far below the temperature at which it will spontaneously detonate , allowing it to be poured or safely combined with other explosives . tnt neither absorbs nor dissolves in water , which allows it to be used effectively in wet environments . to detonate , tnt must be triggered by a pressure wave from a starter explosive , called an explosive booster . source : tnt can be detonated with a high velocity initiator or by efficient concussion . -lsb- 21 -rsb- for many years , tnt used to be the reference point for the figure of insensitivity . tnt had a rating of exactly 100 on the `` f of i '' scale . the reference has since been changed to a more sensitive explosive called rdx , which has an f of i rating of 80 . source : trinitrotoluene -lrb- ; tnt -rrb- , or more specifically 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene , is a chemical compound with the formula c6h2 -lrb- no2 -rrb- 3ch3 . this yellow solid is sometimes used as a reagent in chemical synthesis , but it is best known as an explosive material with convenient handling properties . the explosive yield of tnt is considered to be the standard measure of bombs and the power of explosives . in chemistry , tnt is used to generate charge transfer salts .

the duties of the white house chief of staff vary greatly from one administration to another and , in fact , there is no legal requirement that the president even fill the position . however , since at least 1979 , all presidents have found the need for a chief of staff , who typically oversees the actions of the white house staff , manages the president 's schedule , and decides who is allowed to meet with the president . because of these duties , the chief of staff has at various times been labeled `` the gatekeeper .

watch out , `` make america great again , '' the delegates at the republican national convention are warming up to a new favorite slogan : `` lock her up . '' for a second night in a row , delegates on the floor of the convention chanted the phrase , directed toward presumptive democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton , who they say should face charges for setting up a private email server for official state business . the chant , which delegates began on the first night of the convention monday , was revived again tuesday when new jersey gov. chris christie began a speech by making a case against clinton . source : melania trump stepped onto center stage monday for the highest-profile speech of her life , but the moment was quickly overshadowed by controversy after it emerged that portions of the speech were plagiarized from michelle obama 's 2008 address to the democratic national convention . melania trump initially appeared to deliver the speech her husband needed to portray him in a softer light . she offered testimony about the character of her husband , donald trump , and said he would never let america down . the former fashion model , who rarely takes a leading role on the campaign trail , was the star attraction on the first night of the republican national convention . source : one of the craziest and most tumultuous presidential primary seasons in recent memory comes to a head monday as donald trump arrives in cleveland for the republican national convention . conventions are meant to be festive but tightly disciplined events , a rare moment when the republican party can control the program , reintroduce their candidate and launch him into the fall campaign with a bump in the polls . the political universe will be watching whether trump -- rarely known for his discipline -- can stick to his script . will he unite a party unraveled by his candidacy , or will he blow it apart ?

like the english and irish country houses it was modeled on , the white house was , from the start , open to the public until the early part of the 20th century . president thomas jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805 , and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the capitol followed him home , where he greeted them in the blue room . those open houses sometimes became rowdy : in 1829 , president andrew jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the white house . his aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey . source : clinton has identified two influential moments in his life , both occurring in 1963 , that contributed to his decision to become a public figure . one was his visit as a boys nation senator to the white house to meet president john f. kennedy . -lsb- 4 -rsb- -lsb- 13 -rsb- the other was watching martin luther king jr.

republican sen. lisa murkowski , a key swing vote on the nomination for supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh , suggested tuesday that deborah ramirez , whose accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior against kavanaugh were reported by the new yorker , should talk to congress . when asked by a reporter whether she believed the allegations against kavanaugh were credible , she responded : `` how can i base the credibility based on just what i read coming out of you all ?

'' source : the white house on wednesday stood by president donald trump 's mocking impression of christine blasey ford , with press secretary sarah sanders defending it as `` stating the facts .

despair after the assassination of dr. martin luther king , jr. in april 1968 contributed to riots in north omaha , including one at the logan fontenelle housing project . -lsb- 150 -rsb- for some , the civil rights movement in omaha , nebraska evolved towards black nationalism , as the black panther party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s . organizations such as the black association for nationalism through unity became popular among the city 's black-american youth . this tension culminated in the cause célèbre trial of the rice/poindexter case , in which an omaha police department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call . source : nebraska -lrb- listen -rrb- is a state that lies in both the great plains and the midwestern united states . it is bordered by south dakota to the north ; iowa to the east and missouri to the southeast , both across the missouri river ; kansas to the south ; colorado to the southwest ; and wyoming to the west . it is the only triply landlocked u.s. state . nebraska 's area is just over 77,220 square miles -lrb- 200,000 km2 -rrb- with a population of almost 1.9 million people . source : in the late 19th century , many african americans migrated from the south to nebraska as part of the great migration , primarily to omaha which offered working class jobs in meat packing , the railroads and other industries . omaha has a long history of civil rights activism . blacks encountered discrimination from other americans in omaha and especially from recent european immigrants , ethnic whites who were competing for the same jobs . in 1912 , african americans founded the omaha chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored people to work for improved conditions in the city and state .
murray cantor , ibm distinguished engineer , wrote `` nate silver 's the signal and noise is an excellent description of how prediction works . however , he purposefully leaves out the mathematics . in 2012 , after his triumph of predicting the outcome of the last two presidential elections and selling his `` fivethirtyeight '' blog to the new york times , nate silver accomplished what is almost impossible . in his recent book the signal and the noise , he correctly describes the discipline of making predictions , without explicitly invoking the math . source : while blogging for the times , silver also worked on his book about prediction , which was published in september 2012 . at that time , silver began to drop hints that after 2012 he would turn his attention to matters other than detailed statistical forecasting of elections . as reported in new york magazine : '' ` i view my role now as providing more of a macro-level skepticism , rather than saying this poll is good or this poll is evil , ' he says . and in four -lsb- years -rsb- , he might be even more macro , as he turns his forecasting talents to other fields . source : new york magazine reported that executive editor jill abramson `` put on a full-court press '' to keep silver at the times and that `` for abramson , silver was a tentpole attraction for her favorite subject , national politics , and brought the kind of buzz she thought valuable '' , but the company 's ceo and president mark thompson `` confirmed that keeping silver was not at the top of his agenda '' . the article stated that `` the major reason silver left was because he felt it was thompson who had not committed to building his franchise . the mixed signals from thompson and abramson -- his lack of enthusiasm for committing resources to silver , her desire to keep a major star -- frustrated silver and his lawyer '' . -lsb- 63 -rsb-

during the early history of the university of cambridge , the title professor simply denoted a doctor who taught in the university , a usage that continues to be found in , for example , us universities . however , from the 16th century onwards in cambridge it was used to denote those holding `` chairs '' that had been founded by the university in a particular subject or endowed by a benefaction . source : the paleolithic or palaeolithic or palæolithic -lrb- -rrb- , also called the old stone age , is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers c. 99 % of the time period of human technological prehistory . it extends from the earliest known use of stone tools by hominins c. 3.3 million years ago , to the end of the pleistocene c. 11,650 cal bp.the paleolithic age in europe preceded the mesolithic age , although the date of the transition varies geographically by several thousand years . during the paleolithic age , hominins grouped together in small societies such as bands and subsisted by gathering plants , fishing , and hunting or scavenging wild animals . the paleolithic age is characterized by the use of knapped stone tools , although at the time humans also used wood and bone tools . source : baskerville wrote , `` the importance of the work demands all my attention ; not only for my own -lrb- eternal -rrb- reputation ; but -lrb- i hope -rrb- also to convince the world , that the university in the honour done me has not entirely misplaced their favours .

congress has alternated between periods of constructive cooperation and compromise between parties , known as bipartisanship , and periods of deep political polarization and fierce infighting , known as partisanship . the period after the civil war was marked by partisanship , as is the case today . it is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible . some political scientists speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades , but that an alternation of control of congress between democrats and republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies , as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution . source : the term congress can also refer to a particular meeting of the legislature . a congress covers two years ; the current one , the 116th congress , began on january 3 , 2019 , and will end on january 3 , 2021 . the congress starts and ends on the third day of january of every odd-numbered year . members of the senate are referred to as senators ; members of the house of representatives are referred to as representatives , congresswomen , or congressmen . source : the rough-and-tumble world of legislating is not orderly and civil , human frailties too often taint its membership , and legislative outcomes are often frustrating and ineffective ... still , we are not exaggerating when we say that congress is essential to american democracy . we would not have survived as a nation without a congress that represented the diverse interests of our society , conducted a public debate on the major issues , found compromises to resolve conflicts peacefully , and limited the power of our executive , military , and judicial institutions ... the popularity of congress ebbs and flows with the public 's confidence in government generally ... the legislative process is easy to dislike -- it often generates political posturing and grandstanding , it necessarily involves compromise , and it often leaves broken promises in its trail .

the washington free beacon says it hired intelligence firm fusion gps during the 2016 republican presidential primary . but the conservative news publication denies it had any knowledge or connection to the now-infamous dossier of allegations about president donald trump and russia written by ex-british agent christopher steele , who was commissioned by fusion gps . cnn reported in january that senior us intelligence officials briefed then-president barack obama and president-elect trump about the dossier just weeks before trump 's inauguration . earlier this week , cnn reported that the law firm that represented hillary clinton 's campaign and the democratic national committee hired the firm and entered `` into an engagement for research services that began in april 2016 and concluded before the election in early november .

of all the christological titles used in the new testament , son of god has had one of the most lasting impacts in christian history and has become part of the profession of faith by many christians . -lsb- 78 -rsb- in the mainstream trinitarian context , the title implies the full divinity of jesus as part of the holy trinity of father , son and the spirit . -lsb- 78 -rsb- however , the concept of god as the father of jesus and jesus as the one and only son of god is distinct from the concept of god as the creator and father of all people , as indicated in the apostle 's creed . -lsb- 79 -rsb- the profession begins with expressing belief in the `` father almighty , creator of heaven and earth '' and then immediately , but separately , in `` jesus christ , his only son , our lord '' , thus expressing both senses of fatherhood within the creed . source : christianity is an abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of jesus of nazareth . its adherents , known as christians , believe that jesus is the christ , whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the hebrew bible , called the old testament in christianity , and chronicled in the new testament . -lsb- 1 -rsb- it is the world 's largest religion with about 2.4 billion followers . -lsb- 2 -rsb- source : jesus -lrb- c. 4 bc -- c. ad 30 / 33 -rrb- , also referred to as jesus of nazareth or jesus christ , was a first-century jewish preacher and religious leader . he is the central figure of christianity . most christians believe he is the incarnation of god the son and the awaited messiah -lrb- the christ -rrb- prophesied in the old testament.virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that jesus existed historically , although the quest for the historical jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the gospels and on how closely the jesus portrayed in the bible reflects the historical jesus . jesus was a galilean jew who was baptized by john the baptist and began his own ministry .
some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy . supporters pointed out that clinton 's role in policy was no different from that of other white house advisors , and that voters had been well aware she would play an active role in her husband 's presidency . -lsb- 151 -rsb- bill clinton 's campaign promise of `` two for the price of one '' led opponents to refer derisively to the clintons as `` co-presidents '' or sometimes use the arkansas label `` billary '' . -lsb- 101 -rsb- -lsb- 152 -rsb- -lsb- 153 -rsb- the pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send hillary clinton into `` imaginary discussions '' with the also-politically-active eleanor roosevelt . source : pundits debated whether clinton would address the allegations in his state of the union address . ultimately , he chose not to mention them . hillary clinton remained supportive of her husband throughout the scandal . on january 27 , in an appearance on nbc 's today she said , `` the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president .

pope benedict 's main arena for pastoral activity was the vatican itself , his christmas and easter homilies and urbi et orbi are delivered from st peter 's basilica . the vatican is also the only regular place where benedict xvi traveled via motor without the protective bulletproof case common to most popemobiles . despite the more secure setting , pope benedict was victim to security risks several times inside vatican city . on wednesday , 6 june 2007 during his general audience a man leapt across a barrier , evaded guards and nearly mounted the pope 's vehicle , although he was stopped and benedict seemed to be unaware of the event . source : as regards `` tensions and conflicts in the church '' under pope francis , it has been suggested that `` the reason for the uneasiness is the pope 's emphasis on mission . there is a profound difference between a church that is a nest or a niche , in which one can find peace , tranquility and seeming stability , and a church that sees itself as missionary through and through -- always going out , reaching out to the margins . '' -lsb- 23 -rsb- pope francis from the start of his papacy has called for `` a missionary impulse capable of transforming everything , so that the church 's customs ... and structures can be suitably channeled for the evangelization of today 's world rather than for her self-preservation . '' -lsb- 24 -rsb- for francis , `` missionary outreach is paradigmatic for all the church 's activity '' and it is `` the entire people of god which evangelizes '' , called by their baptism to be missionary disciples . source : for the next couple of months , francis wandered as a beggar in the hills behind assisi . he spent some time at a neighbouring monastery working as a scullion . he then went to gubbio , where a friend gave him , as an alms , the cloak , girdle , and staff of a pilgrim . returning to assisi , he traversed the city begging stones for the restoration of st. damiano 's .

in the 2004 democratic presidential primaries , john kerry defeated several democratic rivals , including sen. john edwards -lrb- d-north carolina -rrb- , former vermont governor howard dean and retired army general wesley clark . his victory in the iowa caucuses is widely believed to be the tipping point where kerry revived his sagging campaign in new hampshire and the february 3 , 2004 , primary states like arizona , south carolina and new mexico . kerry then went on to win landslide victories in nevada and wisconsin . kerry thus won the democratic nomination to run for president of the united states against incumbent george w. bush . source : within the united states armed forces , according to an unscientific survey , the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections . -lsb- 340 -rsb- while 73 percent of military personnel said they would vote for bush , 18 percent preferred his democratic rival , john kerry . -lsb- 340 -rsb- according to peter feaver , a duke university political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the u.s. military , members of the armed services supported bush because they found him more likely than kerry to complete the war in iraq . -lsb- 340 -rsb- source : the 2004 democratic presidential primaries were the selection process by which voters of the democratic party chose its nominee for president of the united states in the 2004 u.s. presidential election . senator john kerry of massachusetts was selected as the nominee through a series of primary elections and caucuses culminating in the 2004 democratic national convention held from july 26 to july 29 , 2004 , in boston , massachusetts . kerry went on to lose the general election on november 2 , 2004 , to incumbent republican president george w. bush .
donald trump announced tuesday evening that his wife will hold a news conference `` over the next couple of weeks '' to address reports that she violated immigration laws when she first came to the u.s. trump said his wife would prove that `` she came in totally legally . '' the new york post last week published nude photos of melania trump in 1995 , quickly raising questions about whether the former model had obtained the appropriate visa to work as a model in the united states . the republican nominee floated the upcoming news conference just hours after he stoked yet another controversy by suggesting that gun owners could take action to stop rival hillary clinton from appointing judges who would infringe second amendment rights , should she be elected president . read : melania trump 's nude photos expose gap in her immigration story `` they said my wife , melania , might have come in illegally . source : republicans are freaking out about donald trump , but the candidate himself is insisting his campaign has never been in better shape . trump took the stage in daytona beach , florida , on wednesday with his presidential bid apparently floundering . republican leaders and even senior members of his own team expressed frustration with his political meltdown on tuesday . the gop nominee tried to stem the growing panic -- addressing the state of his campaign right at the top of his speech . source : donald trump escalated his attacks friday on hillary clinton 's character , just as top former government officials are questioning his own . the republican nominee , speaking in des moines , iowa , accused clinton of being `` unbalanced '' and `` unstable , '' called her a `` dangerous '' and `` pathological '' liar and warned voters in this swing state that a clinton presidency would lead to `` the destruction of this country from within .

another contributing factor for the company 's online dvd rental success was that they could offer a much larger selection of movie titles to choose from than blockbuster 's rental outlets . but when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007 , it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and tv-shows , just 1 % compared to its more than 100,000 different dvd titles . yet as the popularity kept growing , the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in june 2009 . one of the key things about netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch , which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service , by creating a switching cost , but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations . source : in 2014 , opinion blogger felix salmon wrote that netflix could n't `` afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch '' . -lsb- 256 -rsb- he cited as evidence the company 's loss of rights to stream several major movies . according to journalist megan mcardle , the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company ; specifically , she said that '' -lsb- netflix 's -rsb- movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place '' . -lsb- 257 -rsb- source : for some time , the company had considered offering movies online , but it was only in the mid-2000s that data speeds and bandwidth costs had improved sufficiently to allow customers to download movies from the net . the original idea was a `` netflix box '' that could download movies overnight , and be ready to watch the next day . by 2005 , they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service , and were ready to go public with it . but after discovering youtube , and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content , the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead , a project that was completed in 2007 .

as senate republicans , largely outside public scrutiny , hash out details over their health care plan , democrats are hammering them for what they say is a lack of transparency . seven years ago , republicans were complaining about obamacare negotiations -- an imperfect comparison , considering democrats held a number of bipartisan hearings and markups , a white house summit and president barack obama even addressed the gop caucus -- often tweeting their disgust at what they said was backroom deal-making . the man at the helm of the current effort to reshape america 's health care system repeatedly criticized the process through which obamacare was passed . in 2010 , current senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said : `` democrats on capitol hill are working behind the scenes on a plan aimed at jamming this massive health spending bill through congress against the clear wishes of an unsuspecting public . '' source : senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and senate minority leader chuck schumer engaged in dueling statements on friday over health care , one day after the two men expressed hope of more cooperation in a joint interview . the two leaders struck a tone of bipartisanship in a joint interview with cnn 's anderson cooper thursday night at the congressional baseball game , though they stressed they still had their policy differences . those differences were amplified friday when schumer sent a letter friday requesting an all-senators meeting in the old senate chamber next week . senate democrats have been blasting republicans for deliberating the health care bill behind closed doors , saying they 've only been learning of the ongoing negotiations through media reports . source : karen handel 's victory in the georgia special house election tuesday night has house republicans who recently voted for a deeply unpopular bill to repeal obamacare breathing a sigh of relief . and it will now offer some cover -- even political reassurance -- to senate republicans who are gearing up to cast similar votes next week . the democrat in the georgia race , jon ossoff , was unsuccessful in flipping a traditionally republican district in the atlanta suburbs previously represented by health and human services secretary tom price . had the 30-year-old first-time political candidate pulled off an upset , it would have dealt a major blow to the republican party 's already complicated efforts to gut obamacare .
clinton was u.s. secretary of state in the obama administration from 2009 to 2013 . during her tenure , clinton responded to the arab spring by advocating military intervention in libya . she was harshly criticized by republicans for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the 2012 benghazi attack . clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international sanctions against iran in an effort to force it to curtail its nuclear program ; this effort eventually led to the multinational joint comprehensive plan of action agreement in 2015 . source : a march 2 , 2015 new york times article broke the story that the benghazi panel had discovered that clinton exclusively used her own private email server rather than a government-issued one throughout her time as secretary of state , and that her aides took no action to preserve emails sent or received from her personal accounts as required by law . -lsb- 39 -rsb- -lsb- 40 -rsb- -lsb- 41 -rsb- at that point , clinton announced that she had asked the state department to release her emails . -lsb- 42 -rsb- some in the media labeled the controversy `` emailgate .

the rules of the senate provide that no senator may make more than two speeches on a motion or bill on the same legislative day . a legislative day begins when the senate convenes and ends with adjournment ; hence , it does not necessarily coincide with the calendar day . the length of these speeches is not limited by the rules ; thus , in most cases , senators may speak for as long as they please . often , the senate adopts unanimous consent agreements imposing time limits . source : on occasion , the senate may go into what is called a secret or closed session . during a closed session , the chamber doors are closed , cameras are turned off , and the galleries are completely cleared of anyone not sworn to secrecy , not instructed in the rules of the closed session , or not essential to the session . closed sessions are rare and usually held only when the senate is discussing sensitive subject matter such as information critical to national security , private communications from the president , or deliberations during impeachment trials . a senator may call for and force a closed session if the motion is seconded by at least one other member , but an agreement usually occurs beforehand . source : a `` hold '' is placed when the leader 's office is notified that a senator intends to object to a request for unanimous consent from the senate to consider or pass a measure . a hold may be placed for any reason and can be lifted by a senator at any time . a senator may place a hold simply to review a bill , to negotiate changes to the bill , or to kill the bill . a bill can be held for as long as the senator who objects to the bill wishes to block its consideration .

president donald trump shared highly classified information with the russian foreign minister and russian ambassador to the us in a white house meeting last week , the washington post first reported monday . two former officials knowledgeable of the situation confirmed to cnn that the main points of the post story are accurate : the president shared classified information with the russian foreign minister . the president did not directly reveal the source of the information , but intelligence officials told cnn that there is concern that russia will be able to figure out the highly sensitive source . there is some disagreement , according to one of the sources , as to how far the president went . source : the washington post published yet another bombshell report about our president monday . the story , citing unnamed us officials , alleges that donald trump gave visiting russian officials details of intelligence on isis and a plot to blow up planes using laptops -- information that had been given to the united states by an ally . russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov and its ambassador to the united states , sergei kislyak , were made privy to information so secret that the united states had not shared with its own allies , according to the news report -- but trump bragged about it to officials from a hostile government . cnn has not confirmed the washington post report or a new york times report that followed it . source : as news broke on monday evening that donald trump had , according to reports from the washington post and later the new york times , shared code word -lrb- highly classified -rrb- intelligence with the russian foreign minister during his visit to the oval office last week , the shock wave was felt far beyond the beltway . when washington wakes up on tuesday , leaders in middle eastern and european capitals -- and elsewhere around the world -- could be hours into re-evaluating their intelligence sharing relationship with the united states . and can you blame them ? two former officials knowledgeable of the situation confirmed to cnn that the main points of the post story are accurate , and if that is true , donald trump did n't just violate intelligence protocols -- he likely put the lives of members of the intelligence community serving an allied country at risk .

president donald trump continues to weigh phasing out a program that has protected young undocumented immigrants brought to the us as children -- with a decision to sunset the program possible as early as this week . the administration has been reviewing its options on the deferred action for childhood arrivals -lrb- daca -rrb- program for months -- opting to continue the obama administration policy when it took office despite trump 's bellicose campaign rhetoric . the review has intensified in recent weeks , as an ultimatum looms after labor day to force the administration 's hand . trump is said to be weighing two options on daca that would continue protections , but would prevent future applicants and possibly renewals of the two-year permits , according to a source close to the white house and congress . source : house speaker paul ryan on friday gave a major boost to legislative efforts to preserve protections for young undocumented immigrants -- and urged president donald trump to not tear up the program . trump told reporters friday he was still mulling the decision . the white house press secretary said a decision would be announced tuesday . responding to a question about deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca , on his hometown radio station wclo in janesville , wisconsin , ryan said congress was working on a legislative fix to preserve the program . source : president donald trump is expected to end a program that protected undocumented immigrants who came to the united states as children -- so-called `` dreamers '' -- from deportation , four sources familiar with the decision told cnn . two of the sources said the plan is to have a six-month delay in any action regarding the deferred action for childhood arrivals -lrb- daca -rrb- program to allow congress time to pass a fix through legislation that would allow the undocumented immigrants to stay in the country . the expected move -- which comes after weeks of white house deliberations about what to do in response to an ultimatum from 10 state attorneys general led by texas -- would satisfy trump 's base but upend the lives of nearly 800,000 people who were working and studying in the us . the daca program , which gave qualified applicants protections from deportation , is popular among democrats and moderate republicans , many of whom have introduced legislation in congress to try to protect the population permanently .

the justices of the supreme court practice politics as much as law -- and that will be clearer than ever when the issue of same-sex marriage comes before the court on tuesday . public opinion on same-sex marriage has turned upside down since the supreme judicial court in massachusetts first legalized the practice in 2003 . overwhelming opposition has turned into substantial majority support , especially among young people of all political persuasions . even the name of the issue has changed -- to marriage equality . source : a final source of cases is the referral power of the federal government . in such cases , the supreme court is required to give an opinion on questions referred to it by the governor-in-council -lrb- the cabinet -rrb- . however , in many cases , including the most recent same-sex marriage reference , the court has declined to answer a question from the cabinet . in that case , the court said it would not decide if same-sex marriages were required by the charter of rights , because the government had announced it would change the law regardless of its opinion , and subsequently did . source : supreme court justices appeared divided tuesday during historic arguments over the constitutionality of gay marriage , with justice anthony kennedy returning to a familiar role as the court 's pivotal vote . chief justice john roberts -- who shocked conservatives with his swing vote to uphold obamacare -- this time seemed to lean more closely to conservative justices . the arguments unfurled inside a packed courtroom on tuesday while supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage rallied outside -- with one protester even interrupting the arguments from within . related : how a cincinnati judge could shape the gay marriage case many questions on tuesday centered around the definition of marriage and whether the decision to authorize or ban gay marriage should be left to voters in individual states or decided by the judicial system .

republican front-runner donald trump on wednesday tried something new on twitter : defending another presidential candidate . trump took to his favorite social medium to show support for fellow gop presidential hopeful ben carson , who has been criticized for saying tuesday that he would have confronted the gunman who killed nine people at an oregon community college last week and `` not just stand there and let him shoot me .

on the day donald trump became president , black americans exhaled as michelle and barack obama got on that marine one helicopter and flew away from the white house unharmed . in 2008 , black americans quietly worried obama would be assassinated if he won the presidency , or killed before he could take the oath of office . while they may miss the presence of the first black family in the white house , there were more than a few fist bumps that they got out alive . it 's impossible to quantify , but author and professor michael eric dyson spoke for many when he wrote in the new york times in january : `` never far from the surface was the fear that some lunatic bigot might put an end to the life of this extraordinary man . source : chris whipple , author of the gatekeepers : how the white house chiefs of staff define every presidency , loosely describes the role of a white house chief of staff through his interview with former president barack obama : `` during the last days of his presidency , barack obama observed : ` one of the things i 've learned is that the big breakthroughs are typically the result of a lot of grunt work -- just a whole lot of blocking and tackling .

has david cameron 's decision to gamble the future of the united kingdom left his political career in ruin ? it was a move that backfired spectacularly and led to the dramatic announcement that he 'll quit as britain 's prime minister in the aftermath of the brexit vote -- an era-defining moment that will no doubt lead to him being remembered for generations to come as the man who took the country out of the european union . for a man who told members of the conservative party to stop `` banging on '' about europe in his first conference speech as leader , it is perhaps fitting that his reign comes to end with such symmetry . outside 10 downing street friday , cameron , who had defiantly championed the cause of the remain campaign , conceded that his position had become untenable after a night of drama . source : while the british people voted convincingly to leave the european union , a deeply polarized country has emerged . more than 30 million people from england , scotland , wales , northern ireland -- and even tiny gibraltar -- went to the polls , with 51.89 % of them deciding that britain would become the first country to withdraw from the 28-member bloc . yet 48 % of voters disagreed with that decision , leaving a remarkably clear picture geographically . london , scotland and northern ireland wanted to remain , while voters in wales and every english region outside of the capital backed the campaign to leave . source : following the vote by the british electorate in favour to leave the european union on 23 june , cameron announced that he intended to step down as prime minister following the conservative party conference in the autumn of that year during a televised speech on the morning of 24 june 2016 . cameron , who had campaigned in favour of the uk remaining in a reformed eu , said that he had informed the queen of his decision before going to the public . speaking outside of 10 downing street , he remarked that `` fresh leadership '' needed to come in to deliver brexit . -lsb- 3 -rsb- he officially resigned as prime minister of the united kingdom on 13 july 2016 , following the unopposed victory of theresa may at the conservative party leadership election on 11 july .

when lennon , mccartney , and harrison learned that martin and the engineers preferred replacing best with a session drummer for their upcoming recording session on 4 september 1962 , they considered using it as a pretext to permanently dismiss best from the group . eventually , after a very long delay , they asked epstein to dismiss best from the band . -lsb- 68 -rsb- epstein agonized over the decision . as he wrote in his autobiography , a cellarful of noise , he `` was n't sure '' about martin 's assessment of best 's drumming and `` was not anxious to change the membership of the beatles at a time when they were developing as personalities ... i asked the beatles to leave the group as it was '' . source : explaining why geoff britton , one-time drummer in his subsequent band , wings , `` did n't last long '' in that group mccartney said : `` it 's like in the beatles , we had pete best . he was a really good drummer , but there just was something , he was n't quite like the rest of us , we had like a sense of humour in common and he was nearly in with it all , but it 's a fine line , you know , as to what is exactly in and what is nearly in . so he ` left ' -lsb- 95 -rsb- the band and we were looking for someone who would fit .

michelle obama cast the presidential race as one between a positive role model for children -- in hillary clinton -- and a damaging one -- in donald trump -- in the marquee speech on the democratic national convention 's opening night . the first lady never mentioned trump by name , but leveraging her popularity , she made a rare , if not unprecedented , foray into partisan politics to knock the republican nominee . obama condemned `` the hateful language that we hear from public figures on tv , '' saying that `` our motto is , when they go low , we go high . '' and in a shot at trump 's `` make america great again '' campaign slogan , obama discussed raising her children in a white house that was built by slaves . source : hillary clinton on tuesday slammed the first day of the republican national convention as `` surreal , '' comparing it to the `` wizard of oz '' while avoiding mentioning melania trump 's plagiarism controversy . clinton , who did n't watch much of the convention proceedings because she was flying from minneapolis to las vegas , told public service employees at the afscme convention in las vegas that she made the comparison after hearing about delegate protests on the floor and some of the speeches . `` i kept thinking , ` what 's this like ?

the house of representatives voted 266-167 wednesday to approve a budget deal that raises the nation 's debt ceiling through march 2017 , potentially avoiding a fiscal crisis that could have ensued if the nation defaulted on its loans . the measure amounts to one final package crafted by house speaker john boehner with other legislative leaders and president barack obama , as boehner wraps up a tumultuous career leading the house and an even longer career in congress . the deal also clears the plate for gop speaker nominee paul ryan , who surprised some conservatives wednesday when he announced he would support the measure . the deal was approved as 79 republicans joined with 187 democrats to easily clear the number of votes needed to send the measure to the senate . source : congressional leaders and the white house reached a major deal monday to avoid a potential fiscal calamity , but not before many republicans were left fuming that their party leadership had given too much away to their democratic adversaries . the two-year agreement , which would raise domestic and defense spending by $ 80 billion and lift the national borrowing limit until march 2017 , could be voted on by the house as soon as wednesday -- the same day the gop is expected to nominate rep. paul ryan , r-wisconsin , to replace retiring rep. john boehner , r-ohio , as house speaker . the deal prompted a tense session among house republicans monday night in the basement of the capitol . the final details were ironed out late into the night monday , including cuts to the social security disability program and to medicare . source : as the constitution does not state the duties of the speaker , the speaker 's role has largely been shaped by traditions and customs that evolved over time . a partisan position from early in its existence , the speakership began to gain power in legislative development under henry clay -lrb- 1811 -- 1814 , 1815 -- 1820 , and 1823 -- 1825 -rrb- . -lsb- 13 -rsb- in contrast to many of his predecessors , clay participated in several debates , and used his influence to procure the passage of measures he supported -- for instance , the declaration of the war of 1812 , and various laws relating to clay 's `` american system '' economic plan . furthermore , when no candidate received an electoral college majority in the 1824 presidential election causing the president to be elected by the house , speaker clay threw his support to john quincy adams instead of andrew jackson , thereby ensuring adams ' victory .

the report concluded that former dci george tenet failed to adequately prepare the agency to deal with the danger posed by al-qaeda prior to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . -lsb- 176 -rsb- the report was finished in june 2005 and was partially released to the public in an agreement with congress , over the objections of current dci general michael hayden . hayden said its publication would `` consume time and attention revisiting ground that is already well plowed . '' -lsb- 177 -rsb- tenet disagreed with the report 's conclusions , citing his planning efforts vis-à-vis al-qaeda , particularly from 1999 . source : the dhs , like the military , is seen principally as a consumer of national intelligence , but its border and transportation security functions also produce intelligence . at present , however , there is no well-defined way for dhs to task intelligence collection agencies with its requirements . one proposal suggests using the ad/ms as a prototype , to create an ad/homeland security in the cia , and possibly an equivalent position in the u.s. justice department , which , through the fbi and other agencies , legally collects domestic intelligence . -lsb- 14 -rsb- this proposal is one of many to improve coordination and avoid intelligence failures caused by not `` connecting the dots '' , when the dots are held by different agencies . source : the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the united states , tasked with gathering , processing , and analyzing national security information from around the world , primarily through the use of human intelligence -lrb- humint -rrb- . as one of the principal members of the united states intelligence community -lrb- ic -rrb- , the cia reports to the director of national intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the president and cabinet of the united states . unlike the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- , which is a domestic security service , the cia has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering , with only limited domestic intelligence collection . though it is not the only agency of the federal government of the united states specializing in humint , the cia serves as the national manager for coordination of humint activities across the u.s. intelligence community .
the 2008 presidential campaign of ron paul , congressman of texas , began in early 2007 when he announced his candidacy for the 2008 republican nomination for president of the united states . initial opinion polls during the first three quarters of 2007 showed paul consistently receiving support from 3 % or less of those polled . in 2008 , paul 's support among republican voters remained in the single digits , and well behind front-runner john mccain . -lsb- 1 -rsb- source : ronald ernest paul -lrb- born august 20 , 1935 -rrb- is an american author , physician , and retired politician who served as the u.s. representative for texas 's 22nd congressional district from 1976 to 1977 and again from 1979 to 1985 , and for texas 's 14th congressional district from 1997 to 2013 . on three occasions , he sought the presidency of the united states : as the libertarian party nominee in 1988 and as a candidate in the republican primaries of 2008 and 2012 . paul is a critic of the federal government 's fiscal policies , especially the existence of the federal reserve and the tax policy , as well as the military -- industrial complex , and the war on drugs . he has also been a vocal critic of mass surveillance policies such as the usa patriot act and the nsa surveillance programs . source : the political positions of ron paul -lrb- r-tx -rrb- , united states presidential candidate in 1988 , 2008 , and 2012 , are generally described as libertarian , -lsb- 1 -rsb- but have also been labeled conservative -lsb- 2 -rsb- and constitutionalist . -lsb- 3 -rsb- paul 's nickname `` dr. no '' -lsb- 4 -rsb- reflects both his medical degree and his assertion that he will `` never vote for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the constitution '' . -lsb- 5 -rsb- this position has frequently resulted in paul casting the sole `` no '' vote against proposed legislation . the central tenet of paul 's political philosophy is that `` the proper role for government in america is to provide national defense , a court system for civil disputes , a criminal justice system for acts of force and fraud , and little else .
reports that the white house has a tentative plan to replace secretary of state rex tillerson that emerged thursday were an effort to express president donald trump 's deep displeasure and publicly shame his secretary of state , a source with direct knowledge of the white house 's thinking said thursday . the hope from the white house , the source said , is to push out the plan to replace tillerson and then `` wait for him to punch out . '' the news that the white house is seriously considering replacing tillerson with cia director mike pompeo comes as trump remains deeply frustrated with his secretary of state , another source familiar with the president 's thinking said . and the plan is not just being considered at the staff level , but by the president himself , the source said . source : the cousins went back to the farmhouse to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer . in the kitchen they found marks in the red paint on the underside of the mantelpiece above the aga cooker . di cook , a scenes-of-crime officer , took a paint sample from the mantelpiece on 14 august . this was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer . source : it was in july , just a handful of weeks after melania trump and her 11-year-old son , barron , had moved in to the white house full time , that the first lady started to think about something important on her agenda : christmas . with the entire white house to fill with some of the country 's most important holiday décor , trump , as she has done with other issues , began to research , ultimately landing on a theme for her first white house holiday season , according to east wing communications director stephanie grisham . on monday , the first lady will unveil `` time-honored traditions , '' which she personally designed , with a nod to the past 200 years of white house holidays . `` like many families across the country , holiday traditions are very important to us , '' trump said in a statement to cnn .
in what appears to be a brazen , racially motivated attack on a group of counterprotesters in charlottesville , virginia , over the weekend , one person died and many more were injured . on monday president donald trump finally denounced the white supremacists whose demonstration led to the attack -- joining politicians and commentators of all stripes who had already harshly and uniformly condemned the charlottesville attack as a racially motivated terroristic act . even conservative sen. ted cruz has tweeted that the attack should be prosecuted as an act of `` domestic terrorism . '' but sen. cruz should know that , because of the way congress has limited the reach of federal terrorism laws , the driver who plowed his car into the crowd ca n't actually be prosecuted for terrorism . source : attorney general jeff sessions vowed monday that the justice department will `` take the most vigorous action '' to protect americans against `` racism and bigotry '' in the aftermath of the tragedy in charlottesville , virginia , over the weekend . sessions said on cbs 's `` this morning '' that he and fbi director christopher wray will meet with president donald trump monday to discuss the violence that left one woman dead after white supremacists clashed with counter-protesters . the meeting was not originally on trump 's schedule . `` you can be sure this department of justice in this administration is going to take the most vigorous action to protect the right of people like heather heyer , to protest against racism and bigotry , '' sessions said on nbc 's `` today '' show . source : two days have passed since a white supremacist gathering here turned deadly , but tensions remained high monday reverberating beyond charlottesville . frustrations over the saturday rally along with reactions to president donald trump 's initial remarks , in which he blamed `` many sides '' drew protests outside trump tower in new york city . anti-racism rallies were held in several cities monday including in durham county , where protesters pulled down a monument of a confederate soldier , cheering as the statue toppled to the ground . meanwhile in charlottesville , the overt hostility that raged over the weekend between white nationalists and anti-fascist protesters continued outside a courthouse .
perhaps the most important action of obama 's first 100 days was the passage of the american recovery and reinvestment act -lrb- arra -rrb- to address the great recession . after much debate , arra was passed by both the house and senate on february 13 , 2009 . originally intended to be a bipartisan bill , congressional passage of the bill relied largely on democratic votes , though three republican senators did vote for it . -lsb- 34 -rsb- the lack of republican support for the bill , and the inability of democrats to win that support , foreshadowed the gridlock and partisanship that continued throughout obama 's presidency . source : after president trump announced his withdrawal of the united states from the paris agreement on june 1 , obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice : `` but even in the absence of american leadership ; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future ; i 'm confident that our states , cities , and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way , and help protect for future generations the one planet we 've got . '' -lsb- 494 -rsb- source : president obama 's 2011 state of the union address focused on themes of education and innovation , stressing the importance of innovation economics to make the united states more competitive globally . he spoke of a five-year freeze in domestic spending , eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest americans , banning congressional earmarks , and reducing healthcare costs . he promised the united states would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and be 80 % reliant on `` clean '' electricity . -lsb- 227 -rsb- -lsb- 228 -rsb-
bessell further maintained that in january 1969 thorpe called him to a meeting together with holmes , and that again thorpe put forward suggestions for eliminating scott . these were dismissed as impractical or ridiculous by bessell and holmes , who nevertheless agreed to give the matter further consideration . they hoped , said bessell , that if they stalled , thorpe would see the absurdity of his murder scheme and abandon it . holmes , who largely confirmed bessell 's account of the meeting , later justified this decision on the grounds that `` if we had simply said no , he might have gone elsewhere -- and that might have led to an even greater disaster . source : early in december 1968 bessell was summoned to thorpe 's office in the house of commons . according to bessell , thorpe said of scott : `` we 've got to get rid of him '' , and later : `` it is no worse than shooting a sick dog . '' -lsb- 61 -rsb- bessell said later that he was unsure whether thorpe was serious , but decided to play along , by discussing various ways of getting rid of scott 's body . thorpe supposedly thought that disposal down one of cornwall 's many disused tin mines offered the best option , and also suggested his friend david holmes as an appropriate assassin . source : as was the custom of the day , the medals were presented to the athletes during the closing ceremonies of the games . along with the two gold medals , thorpe also received two challenge prizes , which were donated by king gustav v of sweden for the decathlon and czar nicholas ii of russia for the pentathlon . several sources recount that , when awarding thorpe his prize , king gustav said , `` you , sir , are the greatest athlete in the world '' , to which thorpe replied , `` thanks , king '' . -lsb- 46 -rsb- -lsb- 47 -rsb- thorpe biographer kate buford , however , suggested that the story is apocryphal , as she believed that such a comment `` would have been out of character for a man who was highly uncomfortable in public ceremonies and hated to stand out .

controversial comments about rape and abortion also came from other republican legislators and legislative candidates . following todd akin 's comments , reporters at the pennsylvania press club asked pennsylvania republican senate candidate tom smith on august 27 , 2012 , how , considering his no-exceptions anti-abortion stance , he would tell a daughter or granddaughter who had been raped that she must keep the pregnancy . smith said that he had been in a similar situation because his daughter had become pregnant out of wedlock . he said that he was not equating the two situations but that a father 's position was similar . source : u.s. senate candidate richard mourdock said wednesday that he is sorry if he offended anyone by saying that pregnancies from rape are `` something that god intended to happen '' but accused democrats of distorting his comments for political gain . `` for those who want to kind of twist the comments and use them for partisan , political gain , i think that 's what 's wrong with washington these days , '' the indiana candidate said . `` i spoke from my heart ; i spoke with my principle ; i spoke from my faith . and if others want to somehow turn those words and use them against me , again , that 's what 's wrong with washington today . source : although indiana is usually considered a republican stronghold , mourdock lost the general election to democratic nominee joe donnelly after the media attention over his comment in a debate that `` life is that gift from god that i think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape , that it is something that god intended to happen .

secretary of state mike pompeo pinned the blame on iran for an attack at a saudi oil field in a pair of tweets saturday . drone strikes on crucial saudi arabian oil facilities have disrupted about half of the kingdom 's oil capacity , or 5 % of the daily global oil supply , cnn business reported earlier saturday . yemen 's houthi rebels took responsibility for the attacks but they are often backed by iran . but preliminary indications are that the attacks did not originate from yemen and likely originated from iraq , according to a source with knowledge of the incident . source : yemen 's houthi rebels have attacked saudi arabia 's oil facilities with drones , the houthi-run al-masirah news agency said saturday . a yemen armed forces spokesman was quoted by the agency as saying the houthis successfully carried out a `` large-scale '' operation with 10 drones targeting saudi aramco oil facilities in abqaiq and khurais . but preliminary indications are that the attacks saturday that disrupted about half of the kingdom 's oil capacity did not originate from yemen and likely originated from iraq , according to a source with knowledge of the incident . the same official said the damage was caused by an armed drone attack . source : a few days after the abqaiq and the khurais oil facilities in saudi arabia were attacked , members of congress sought information about the culprit and debated whether us military action would be necessary . vice president mike pence told a group of republican senators at lunch tuesday in the capitol that the us goal is to `` restore deterrence '' after the attacks , which caused oil prices to fluctuate , but he did not suggest any specific retaliatory measures , according to sen. lindsey graham . `` he said that the goal was to ` restore deterrence ' and he left it at that , '' said the south carolina republican . white house deputy press secretary hogan gidley told reporters that the trump administration `` ca n't say definitively '' that iran was behind the attacks , but that `` in all likelihood '' it was .

a polish joke is an ethnic joke used to mock the polish people in the english language based on negative stereotypes . a ` polish joke ' belongs to the category of conditional jokes , whose full understanding requires from the audience a prior knowledge of what a polish joke is . similar to all discriminatory jokes , so-called polish jokes depend upon the listener 's preconceived notions and their affective dislikes . -lsb- 1 -rsb- the relationship between these internalized negative stereotypes about the polish people and the persistence of ethnic jokes about them is not easy to trace , although they can be understood by many . source : according to wincenty kadłubek 's polish chronicle , the wawel dragon appeared during the reign of king krakus -lrb- lat . gracchus -rrb- . the dragon required weekly offerings of cattle , if not , humans would have been devoured instead . in the hope of killing the dragon , krakus called on his two sons , lech and krakus ii . source : the name of kraków is traditionally derived from krakus -lrb- krak , grakch -rrb- , the legendary founder of kraków and a ruler of the tribe of lechitians . in polish , kraków is an archaic possessive form of krak and essentially means `` krak 's -lrb- town -rrb- '' . krakus 's name may derive from `` krakula '' , a proto-slavic word -lsb- 17 -rsb- meaning a judge 's staff , or from `` krak '' , a proto-slavic word meaning an oak , once a sacred tree most often associated with the concept of genealogy . the first recorded mention of prince krakus -lrb- then written as grakch -rrb- dates back to 1190 , although the town existed as early as the 7th century , when it was inhabited by the tribe of vistulans .

as president donald trump urged yet another foreign government to investigate one of his political rivals -- this time in full view of cameras and microphones -- white house aides and allies of the president were bracing for a bitter standoff with congress . white house officials have begun attempts to piece together the timeline and circumstances surrounding the president 's now infamous call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky , one white house official said . meanwhile , white house lawyers were drafting a letter to lawmakers insisting that none of their requests would be fulfilled until the house formally votes to open an impeachment inquiry . the developments reflect the first outlines of an administration plan to confront the growing impeachment crisis , which has proceeded at rapid pace since details of the president 's conversation with ukraine emerged last week . source : assistant to the president became a rank generally shared by the chief of staff with such senior aides as deputy chiefs of staff , the white house counsel , the white house press secretary , and others . this new system did not catch on immediately . democrats kennedy and johnson still relied on their appointments secretaries instead , and it was not until the nixon administration that the chief of staff took over maintenance of the president 's schedule . this concentration of power in the nixon and ford white house -lrb- whose last chief of staff was dick cheney -rrb- led presidential candidate jimmy carter to campaign in 1976 with the promise that he would not appoint a chief of staff . source : richard nixon 's first chief of staff , h. r. haldeman , garnered a reputation in washington for the iron hand he wielded in the position -- famously referring to himself as `` the president 's son-of-a-bitch '' , he was a rigid gatekeeper who would frequently meet with administration officials in place of the president , then report himself to nixon on the officials ' talking points . journalist bob woodward , in his books all the president 's men and the secret man , wrote that many of his sources , including the famous deep throat , displayed a genuine fear of haldeman . -lsb- 11 -rsb- -lsb- 12 -rsb-

the israelites -lrb- ; hebrew : בני ישראל bnei yisra'el -rrb- were a confederation of iron age semitic-speaking tribes of the ancient near east , who inhabited a part of canaan during the tribal and monarchic periods . according to the religious narrative of the hebrew bible , the israelites ' origin is traced back to the biblical patriarchs and matriarchs abraham and his wife sarah , through their son isaac and his wife rebecca , and their son jacob who was later called israel , whence they derive their name , with his wives leah and rachel and the handmaids zilpa and bilhah . modern archaeology has largely shown that determining the historicity of the religious narrative is impossible , with many scholars viewing the stories as inspiring national myth narratives with little historical value . based on the archaeological evidence , according to the modern archaeological account , the israelites and their culture did not overtake the region by force , but instead branched out of the indigenous canaanite peoples that long inhabited the southern levant , syria , ancient israel , and the transjordan region through a gradual evolution of a distinct monolatristic -- later cementing as monotheistic -- religion centered on yahweh . source : the palestinian people -lrb- arabic : الشعب الفلسطيني , ash-sha ` b al-filasṭīnī -rrb- , also referred to as palestinians -lrb- arabic : الفلسطينيون , al-filasṭīniyyūn , hebrew : פָלַסְטִינִים -rrb- or palestinian arabs -lrb- arabic : الفلسطينيين العرب , ạl-flsṭynyyn ạl-ʿrb -rrb- , are an ethnonational group comprising the modern descendants of the peoples who have lived in palestine continuously over the centuries and who today are largely culturally and linguistically arab ; this definition includes those ethnic jews and samaritans who fit this definition . despite various wars and exoduses -lrb- such as that in 1948 -rrb- , roughly one half of the world 's palestinian population continues to reside in historic palestine , the area encompassing the west bank , the gaza strip and israel . in this combined area , as of 2005 , palestinians constituted 49 % of all inhabitants , encompassing the entire population of the gaza strip -lrb- 1.865 million -rrb- , the majority of the population of the west bank -lrb- approximately 2,785,000 versus about 600,000 jewish israeli citizens , which includes about 200,000 in east jerusalem -rrb- and 20.95 % of the population of israel proper as arab citizens of israel . many are palestinian refugees or internally displaced palestinians , including more than a million in the gaza strip , about 750,000 in the west bank and about 250,000 in israel proper . source : israel -lrb- ; hebrew : יִשְׂרָאֵל ; arabic : إِسْرَائِيل -rrb- , also known as the state of israel -lrb- hebrew : מְדִינַת יִשְׂרָאֵל -rrb- , is a country in western asia , located on the southeastern shore of the mediterranean sea and the northern shore of the red sea . it has land borders with lebanon to the north , syria to the northeast , jordan on the east , the palestinian territories of the west bank and gaza strip to the east and west , respectively , and egypt to the southwest . the country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area . israel 's economic and technological center is tel aviv , while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is jerusalem , although the state 's sovereignty over jerusalem has only partial recognition.israel has evidence of the earliest migration of hominids out
baltimore did not take president donald trump 's recent attack of the city lying down . instead , charm city was quick to stand up and fight back . trump lashed out at another prominent african american lawmaker on saturday , tweeting that his baltimore district is a `` disgusting , rat and rodent infested mess . '' the president 's tirade was directed at house oversight committee chairman elijah cummings , who represents maryland 's 7th congressional district in the house and recently lambasted conditions at the border . source : president donald trump launched a feud with the rev. al sharpton on monday , escalating a series of attacks on prominent black leaders and minority progressives . trump has recently called out minority lawmakers and leaders in an effort to define the democratic party and strengthen his base ahead of the 2020 presidential election . his morning tirade against sharpton , a longtime african-american activist , come after a weekend in which the president repeatedly assailed maryland democratic rep. elijah cummings , who is black , and the city of baltimore , parts of which lie in cummings ' district . source : president donald trump 's attacks on democratic rep. elijah cummings have n't gained as much internal support at the white house as his earlier attacks on the `` squad , '' according to administration officials . but there are no signs trump believes his strategy is wrong or is planning to pull back his attacks on the african american lawmaker from baltimore . one official confirmed that some aides express discomfort at the attacks , which do not appear to have been part of a larger strategy , during a monday staff meeting first reported by the new york times . instead , aides said trump has long expressed annoyance at cummings ' attempts to investigate members of the administration and identified baltimore as a target over the weekend .

tensions are building within the house democratic caucus over the judiciary committee 's march toward impeachment , with democrats again at odds over their messaging and strategy during a crucial time facing their majority . in the aftermath of corey lewandowski 's testimony this week , some democrats are openly questioning the wisdom of bringing forward the bombastic former trump campaign manager , whose contentious exchanges with democrats and stonewalling of their questions may have overshadowed a key aspect of his testimony : that president donald trump enlisted lewandowski to tell the then-attorney general to limit the investigation into his 2016 campaign . what has irked some democrats is the failure to hold lewandowski in contempt immediately during the hearing , according to democratic sources . that may soon change as the committee weighs holding him in contempt , source says . source : congress ' first efforts to impeach trump were initiated by democratic representatives al green and brad sherman in 2017 . -lsb- 7 -rsb- in december 2017 , an impeachment resolution failed in the house with a 58 -- 364 vote margin . following the 2018 elections , the democrats gained a majority in the house and launched multiple investigations into trump 's actions and finances . -lsb- 8 -rsb- speaker of the house nancy pelosi initially resisted calls for impeachment . source : the ukraine scandal raging around donald trump is forcing democrats to confront a fateful choice on impeachment that will not just shape the 2020 election but will echo down the ages . the facts of whether the president pressured ukraine to investigate his potential democratic general election opponent joe biden while a us military aid package was on the table are still obscured . trump supporters say there is so far no evidence that he offered a quid pro quo to the ukrainians and note that an intelligence community whistleblower who raised the alarm was operating with a second-hand knowledge of trump 's conversations . but if trump used his power to try to coerce a foreign leader into influencing us elections , it could precipitate the worst political crisis of a presidency that has been mired in notoriety from its first hours .

while clinging to armed struggle as the prime means , the plo no longer excluded peaceful means . therefore , the ten point program was considered the first attempt by the plo at peaceful resolution . in october 1974 , the arab league proclaimed the plo `` the sole legitimate representative of the palestinian people in any palestinian territory that is liberated '' , and also the un recognized the plo . from then , the diplomatic road was prepared . source : as the israeli advance on beirut pressed forward in the west , reaching khalde on 11 june . six miles south of beirut , the town was the last plo position in front of beirut airport . the israelis , who stood on the outskirts of beirut , advanced towards the airport , and engaged in frequent combat with plo and syrian units as israeli warplanes continued to bomb plo positions in beirut . the plo 's situation gradually grew worse as the israeli advance gained ground , threatening to trap the plo and a syrian brigade deployed with them in the city . source : in may 1999 , the five years interim period ended without reaching a comprehensive peace agreement , but elements of the oslo accords remained . the interim palestinian authority became permanent , and a dominant factor of the plo . the west bank remained divided into areas a , b and c. area c , covering some 60 % of the west bank , is under exclusive israeli military and civilian control . less than 1 % of area c is designated for use by palestinians , who are also unable to build in their own existing villages in area c due to israeli restrictions .

when vice president mike pence woke up tuesday in the west of ireland , he had a long commute ahead of him : the span of the entire island to dublin , where he was meeting with government officials . the reason for the journey : pence was staying at the golf property owned by his boss , president donald trump , in doonbeg . that 's 181 miles -- or an hour 's drive plus a 40-minute flight -- away from the government buildings where pence will conduct his official visit on tuesday . pence also happens to have family connections to the tiny irish village , surrounded by windswept atlantic coastline and bogland . source : house democrats are demanding documents on president donald trump 's promotion of his miami resort for next year 's g7 summit and vice president mike pence 's recent stay at trump 's ireland golf property that was hours away from where he conducted official business . the house oversight committee and the house judiciary committees this week sent a series of letters requesting documents and other information from the white house , the vice president 's office , the us secret service and the trump organization about the two matters . `` the committee does not believe that u.s. taxpayer funds should be used to personally enrich president trump , his family , and his companies , '' wrote oversight chairman , democratic rep. elijah cummings of maryland . the requests are part of the judiciary committee 's decision to broaden its probe into the president as the committee decides whether to bring articles of impeachment against trump . source : with fealty to president donald trump as his defining political trait , vice president mike pence is n't typically the man in the spotlight . but his latest european jaunt has been marked with unfortunate headlines and questions about how far he 's willing to go to please his boss . pence 's trip was meant to show off his ancestry and bolster a key us ally . now -- with one stop left -- the diplomacy has been overshadowed by ethics questions , and that ally , british prime minister boris johnson , is facing a political crisis of his own .
the republican party , also referred to as the gop -lrb- grand old party -rrb- , is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the united states ; the other is its historic rival , the democratic party . the gop was founded in 1854 by opponents of the kansas -- nebraska act , which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into certain u.s. territories . the party supported classical liberalism , opposed the expansion of slavery , and supported economic reform . abraham lincoln was the first republican president . source : representatives introduce a bill while the house is in session by placing it in the hopper on the clerk 's desk . -lsb- 111 -rsb- it is assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage . -lsb- 111 -rsb- drafting statutes requires `` great skill , knowledge , and experience '' and sometimes take a year or more . -lsb- 1 -rsb- sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction . source : ideas for legislation can come from members , lobbyists , state legislatures , constituents , legislative counsel , or executive agencies . anyone can write a bill , but only members of congress may introduce bills . most bills are not written by congress members , but originate from the executive branch ; interest groups often draft bills as well . the usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review .
from 1860 to 1912 , the republicans took advantage of the association of the democrats with `` rum , romanism , and rebellion '' . rum stood for the liquor interests and the tavernkeepers , in contrast to the gop , which had a strong dry element . `` romanism '' meant roman catholics , especially irish americans , who ran the democratic party in every big city and whom the republicans denounced for political corruption . `` rebellion '' stood for the democrats of the confederacy , who tried to break the union in 1861 ; and the democrats in the north , called `` copperheads '' , who sympathized with them . source : unlike the `` moderate '' , internationalist , largely eastern bloc of republicans who accepted -lrb- or at least acquiesced in -rrb- some of the `` roosevelt revolution '' and the essential premises of president truman 's foreign policy , the republican right at heart was counterrevolutionary . anti-collectivist , anti-communist , anti-new deal , passionately committed to limited government , free market economics , and congressional -lrb- as opposed to executive -rrb- prerogatives , the g.o.p. conservatives were obliged from the start to wage a constant two-front war : against liberal democrats from without and `` me-too '' republicans from within . -lsb- 44 -rsb- source : before 1948 , the southern democrats saw their party as the defender of the southern way of life , which included a respect for states ' rights and an appreciation for traditional southern values . they repeatedly warned against the aggressive designs of northern liberals and republicans as well as the civil rights activists they denounced as `` outside agitators '' , thus there was a serious barrier to becoming a republican . -lsb- 75 -rsb-

political polarization has gone from a polling data point to a punch line since the 2016 election . in this , the first major election since president donald trump came to power , the midterm elections are , to many experts , shaping up to be more than the names that appear on the ballots . at the heart of it , the midterms will likely be , at least in part , a way for voters to say : `` this is the kind of america i want . '' cnn opinion asked a diverse group of thinkers to weigh in . source : fivethirtyeight , sometimes rendered as 538 , is a website that focuses on opinion poll analysis , politics , economics , and sports blogging . the website , which takes its name from the number of electors in the united states electoral college , was founded on march 7 , 2008 as a polling aggregation website with a blog created by analyst nate silver . in august 2010 , the blog became a licensed feature of the new york times online . it was renamed fivethirtyeight : nate silver 's political calculus . source : furthermore , a basic intuition that silver drew from his analysis of the 2008 democratic party primary elections was that the voting history of a state or congressional district provided clues to current voting . this is what allowed him to beat all the pollsters in his forecasts in the democratic primaries in north carolina and indiana , for example . -lsb- 11 -rsb- using such information allowed silver to come up with estimates of the vote preferences even in states for which there were few if any polls . for his general election projections for each state , in addition to relying on the available polls in a given state and `` similar states , '' silver estimated a `` 538 regression '' using historical voting information along with demographic characteristics of the states to create an estimate that he treated as a separate poll -lrb- equivalent to the actually available polls from that state -rrb- .
a puisne justice of the supreme court is referred to as the honourable mr/madam justice and the chief justice as right honourable . at one time , judges were addressed as `` my lord '' or `` my lady '' during sessions of the court , but the court discourages this style of address and has directed lawyers to use the simpler `` justice '' , `` mr justice '' or `` madam justice '' . -lsb- 11 -rsb- the designation `` my lord/my lady '' continues in many provincial superior courts and in the federal court of canada and federal court of appeal , where it is optional . source : in 1986 , chief justice warren burger informed the white house of his intent to retire . reagan first decided to nominate associate justice william rehnquist to become chief justice . that choice meant that reagan would also have to choose a nominee to fill rehnquist 's seat as associate justice . -lsb- 36 -rsb- attorney general edwin meese , who advised reagan on the choice , seriously considered only scalia and robert bork , a fellow judge on the dc court of appeals . source : chief justice warren burger was renowned , and even vilified in some quarters , for voting strategically during conference discussions on the supreme court in order to control the court 's agenda through opinion assignment . indeed , burger is said to have often changed votes to join the majority coalition , cast `` phony votes '' by voting against his preferred position , and declined to express a position at conference . -lsb- 12 -rsb-
charles and david koch have been active in american politics since at least 1980 , when david koch was the libertarian party 's vice-presidential nominee . their political contributions began to attract widespread attention from media outlets in 2008 , when , through their family foundations , the brothers contributed to 34 political and policy organizations , three of which they founded , and several of which they directed . -lsb- 14 -rsb- they have since organized a network of an estimated 500 libertarian and conservative donors , -lsb- 15 -rsb- candidates , think tanks , and other groups . as an example of their influence , jane mayer noted house speaker john boehner 's appeal to david koch in 2011 when boehner needed votes to prevent a government shutdown . source : the political activities of the koch brothers include the financial and political influence of charles g. and david h. koch -lrb- 1940 -- 2019 -rrb- on united states politics . this influence is seen both directly and indirectly via various political and public policy organizations that were supported by the koch brothers . -lsb- 1 -rsb- -lsb- 2 -rsb- -lsb- 3 -rsb- -lsb- 4 -rsb- source : as of mid 2018 , the chief `` lieutenants '' of charles and david koch have encouraged media to refer to the `` koch network '' rather than the `` koch brothers '' in their reporting . the network was founded by charles and david koch and is made up of `` several hundred '' -lrb- another estimate is about 500 -rrb- -lsb- 54 -rsb- donors who pay a minimum of $ 100,000 each year , and work to influence american life in a conservative direction . -lsb- 55 -rsb- the network has been called `` one of the nation 's most influential political forces '' , -lsb- 54 -rsb- `` a shadow political party , complete with its own field offices and national voter database '' . in the two years up to 2018 it is estimated to have spent $ 400 million on `` policy and politics '' , and `` millions more on educational and philanthropic initiatives '' .
the senate took a bipartisan swipe at president donald trump on tuesday when it overwhelmingly approved a motion of support for nato . the 97-2 vote reflects the broad concerns on capitol hill over trump 's seeming ambivalence about the alliance and his commitment to it . the vote came the same day trump arrived in brussels , belgium , for a summit of nato nations and shortly before he heads to helsinki , finland , for a one-on-one session with russian president vladimir putin . before he landed in brussels , trump tweeted some of his concerns about nato : `` many countries in nato , which we are expected to defend , are not only short of their current commitment of 2 % -lrb- which is low -rrb- , but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made . source : for the second day in a row , the senate pushed back on president donald trump , showing stiff resistance to his key policy decisions on tariffs and nato even as the president is at a summit in europe wrestling with allies over those same issues . senators voted overwhelmingly wednesday calling on trump to get congressional approval before using national security as a reason for imposing tariffs on other nations , as he did recently with steel and aluminum levies against mexico , canada and the european union . the bipartisan 88-to-11 tally on the non-binding resolution sends a message to the white house about how frustrated senators are over trump 's disruptive moves on tariffs . however , future efforts to pass enforceable legislation likely face an uphill battle over trump 's objections . source : on the fourth chaotic day of fallout from president donald trump 's hugely consequential remarks regarding the us relationship to russia , congress did something rare : it took unified action . the senate overwhelmingly approved a proposal to oppose sending us officials to be interrogated by russian officials , though it 's unclear what if any concrete legislative options republican leaders in congress would take beyond statements and non-binding resolutions . the 98-0 vote came after the white house announced it now disagreed with the proposal from russian president vladimir putin to question former us ambassador to russia michael mcfaul and others , which the white house had up until thursday afternoon said it was considering . thursday 's vote was a rare sign of consensus to address the divisive fallout of trump 's highly controversial remarks earlier this week , where the us president appeared to back putin over the us intelligence community assessment that russia interfered with the 2016 us presidential election .

a day after a terrorist mowed down dozens of people celebrating bastille day in the coastal french city of nice , investigators dug into the life of the man they say was the killer : a 31-year-old delivery driver and nice resident who was born in tunisia . authorities said mohamed lahouaiej bouhlel drove a rented , refrigerated truck weighing about 20 tons into crowds along a roughly 2-kilometer stretch of promenade des anglais on thursday night , killing 84 people -- including 10 children and adolescents -- and injuring 202 others . the attack ended when police shot into the truck , killing bouhlel , french prosecutor françois molins said friday . of the injured , 52 were in critical condition , and 25 were in a coma , molins said . source : if there is one immediate lesson to be drawn from the third terrorist attack in france in 18 months , it is that little has changed beyond the techniques used to rain death and destruction on a population only barely healing from the last blow . sadly , it 's clear that the forces of law and order have developed little or no understanding of what is happening within the vast community of extremists who now seem capable of holding one of europe 's leading , yet most vulnerable , nations in their thrall . and worse yet , france continues to lack the coordination so desperately needed if the next attack is to be thwarted before it can be unleashed . barely 12 hours before a large truck ripped through the throng strung along nice 's promenade des anglais to watch the fireworks marking bastille day , france 's military might paraded in force down the champs-elysees in paris , past the viewing stand where president francois hollande sat with his cabinet and guests , including u.s. secretary of state john kerry . source : amid the terror , carnage and panic , it did n't take long for nice 's residents to open their doors and hearts as the city reacted to the deaths of over 80 people after a truck rammed into a crowd celebrating a national holiday . they did so by tweeting #portesouvertesnice which quickly started trending , with local newspaper nice matin one of the first to use the hashtag , which was retweeted over 3,000 times . a number of countries ' foreign offices also shared the hashtag , as did the nice twitter account . one twitter user , who has lived in nice for five years , told cnn -- he did n't want to be identified -- that after tweeting the hashtag six french people in their twenties came to his home for shelter .

'' source : robert pape 's exhaustive study of suicide terrorism found that `` al-qaeda 's transnational suicide terrorists have come overwhelmingly from america 's closest allies in the muslim world and not at all from the muslim regimes that the u.s. state department considers ` state sponsors of terrorism ' . '' -lsb- 47 -rsb- pape notes that no al-qaeda suicide attackers came from iraq . daniel byman 's study of state sponsorship of terrorism similarly did not list iraq as a significant state sponsor , and called the al-qaeda connection `` a rationale that before the war was strained and after it seems an ever-weaker reed .

the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical , geographical , and political context in which it is used . american is derived from america , a term originally denoting all of the new world -lrb- also called the americas -rrb- . in some expressions , it retains this pan-american sense , but its usage has evolved over time and , for various historical reasons , the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america . in modern english , american generally refers to persons or things related to the united states of america ; among native english speakers this usage is almost universal , with any other use of the term requiring specification . source : i am a black man , but the next time i fly , i do n't plan to avoid american airlines , despite the travel advisory the naacp released this week about possible discrimination against black people by that airline . it 's hard to be alarmed by the advisory , given the paucity of evidence the revered civil rights organization has so far presented -- and because we are living in volatile times during which profound questions about racial and other forms of inequality are popping up everywhere . the advisory seems trivial by comparison . during times like these , there 's only so much moral bandwidth available to highlight and combat wrongs where we can prove them . source : the united states of america -lrb- usa -rrb- , commonly known as the united states -lrb- u.s. or us -rrb- or america , is a country comprising 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . at 3.8 million square miles -lrb- 9.8 million km2 -rrb- , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of europe . most of the country is located in central north america between canada and mexico . with an estimated population of over 328 million , the u.s. is the third most populous country .
after four years of political campaigning for democratic candidates around new jersey , bradley decided in the summer of 1977 to run for the senate himself , coinciding with his retirement from the knicks . he felt his time had been well-spent in `` paying his dues '' . the seat was held by liberal republican and four-term incumbent clifford p. case . case lost the primary election to anti-tax conservative jeffrey bell , who , like bradley , was 34 years old as the campaign season began . source : on march 9 , 2000 , after failing to win any of the first 20 primaries and caucuses in the election process , bradley withdrew his campaign and endorsed gore ; he ruled out the idea of running as the vice-presidential candidate and did not answer questions about possible future runs for the presidency . he said that he would continue to speak out regarding his brand of politics , calling for campaign finance reform , gun control , and increased health care insurance . -lsb- 69 -rsb- -lsb- 70 -rsb- source : serious early speculation surrounded bill bradley , a u.s. senator and former nba player , who had long been considered a potential democratic contender for the presidency . in december 1998 , bradley formed a presidential exploratory committee and began organizing a campaign . -lsb- 2 -rsb- gore , however , had been considered the favorite for the democratic nomination as early as 1997 , with the commencement of president clinton 's second term .

after the federal government moved to washington , d.c. , the court had no permanent meeting location until 1810 . when the architect benjamin henry latrobe had the second u.s. senate chamber built directly on top of the first us senate chamber , the supreme court took up residence in what is now referred to as the old supreme court chamber from 1810 through 1860 . -lsb- 7 -rsb- it remained in the capitol until 1935 , with the exception of a period from 1812 to 1819 , during which the court was absent from washington because of the british invasion and the destruction of the capitol during the war of 1812 . -lsb- 6 -rsb- source : this development led to some comment . law school professor jeffrey rosen wrote that `` it 's a fascinating truth that we 've allowed religion to drop out of consideration on the supreme court , and right now , we have a supreme court that religiously at least , by no means looks like america '' . -lsb- 105 -rsb- source : the supreme court , it is noted , can not directly enforce its rulings ; instead , it relies on respect for the constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments . one notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832 , when the state of georgia ignored the supreme court 's decision in worcester v. georgia . president andrew jackson , who sided with the georgia courts , is supposed to have remarked , `` john marshall has made his decision ; now let him enforce it !

' pre-1949 films to united artists television for the modest sum of $ 21 million . `` this is our heritage , what we worked all our lives to create , and now it is gone , '' warner exclaimed , upon hearing of the deal . -lsb- 121 -rsb- shortly after doing this , jack took a long vacation in southern france . source : as a result of their financial problems , warner bros. took the next step and released the jazz singer starring al jolson . this movie , which includes little sound dialogue , but did feature sound segments of jolson singing , was a sensation . it signaled the beginning of the era of `` talking pictures '' and the twilight of the silent era . however , sam died the night before the opening , preventing the brothers from attending the premiere . source : despite these misgivings , the purchase ultimately proved very beneficial to the warner group . reprise flourished in the late 1960s thanks to sinatra 's famous `` comeback '' and the hits by sinatra and his daughter nancy , and the label also secured the us distribution rights to the recordings of the kinks and jimi hendrix . most importantly for the future of the company , the merger brought reprise manager mo ostin into the warner fold and `` his ultimate value to warner bros. would dwarf sinatra 's '' . -lsb- 24 -rsb- ostin 's business and musical instincts and his rapport with artists were to prove crucial to the success of the warner labels over the next two decades .
alan greenspan was the chairman of the federal reserve of the united states from 1987 to 2006 . he was appointed by president ronald reagan in august 1987 and was reappointed by president bill clinton in 1996 . he was , perhaps , the person most singly responsible for the housing bubble in the u.s. , although he said that `` i really did n't get it until very late in 2005 and 2006 . '' -lsb- 42 -rsb- greenspan stated that the housing bubble was `` fundamentally engendered by the decline in real long-term interest rates '' , -lsb- 43 -rsb- though he also claims that long-term interest rates are beyond the control of central banks because `` the market value of global long-term securities is approaching $ 100 trillion '' and thus these and other asset markets are large enough that they `` now swamp the resources of central banks '' . source : in september 2008 joseph stiglitz stated that greenspan `` did n't really believe in regulation ; when the excesses of the financial system were noted , -lrb- he and others -rrb- called for self-regulation -- an oxymoron '' . -lsb- 86 -rsb- greenspan , according to the new york times , says he himself is blameless . -lsb- 87 -rsb- on april 6 , 2005 , greenspan called for a substantial increase in the regulation of fannie mae and freddie mac : `` appearing before the senate banking committee , the fed chairman , alan greenspan , said the enormous portfolios of the companies -- nearly a quarter of the home-mortgage market -- posed significant risks to the nation 's financial system should either company face significant problems . '' -lsb- 88 -rsb- despite this , greenspan still claims to be a firm believer in free markets , although in his 2007 biography he wrote , `` history has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums '' as seen before the credit crisis of 2008 . source : in a cnbc interview at the end of july 2008 , alan greenspan said he believed the u.s. was not yet in a recession , but that it could enter one due to a global economic slowdown . -lsb- 27 -rsb-

before launching a military strike on a syrian government target , president donald trump said thursday that `` something should happen '' with regard to syrian leader bashar al-assad in the wake of this week 's chemical attack , which us officials say he perpetrated . `` i think what assad did is terrible . i think what happened in syria is one of the truly egregious crimes . it should n't have happened . source : two days after footage of a grisly chemical weapons attack on civilians made its way around the world , president donald trump decided to launch a military strike against the syrian regime responsible for the horrific attack . but while the decision to strike syrian government targets marked a sharp reversal in the president 's stance on syria -- one that called for a laser-like focus on isis and largely ignoring assad -- the sharp , 180-degree turn did n't happen over a matter of days . ` holocaust ' months earlier , during an off-the-record holiday gathering with reporters at his opulent mar-a-lago estate a week before christmas , trump spoke at length about the carnage of the syrian civil war , revealing that the issue was weighing on him as he prepared to take office . trump spokeswoman hope hicks authorized cnn on friday to report the contents of his remarks on the topic at the gathering , which cnn attended . source : in a policy shift that will make heads spin , the trump administration has in the space of a few days gone from a hands-off approach to the civil war in syria to launching of dozens of tomahawk missiles against a syrian air base near the city of homs . so why the dramatic pivot ? and what are the key takeaways from this development that has broken years of us reluctance to strike bashar al-assad directly ? chemical weapons attacks genuinely moved trump president donald trump does n't strike us as a sentimentalist , particularly when it comes to hapless citizens in foreign lands .
the australian democrats is a centrist political party in australia . founded in 1977 from a merger of the australia party and the new liberal movement , both of which were descended from liberal party splinter group , it was australia 's largest minor party from its formation in 1977 through to 2004 and frequently held the balance of power in the senate during that time.the party 's inaugural leader was don chipp , a former liberal cabinet minister , who famously promised to `` keep the bastards honest '' . at the 1977 federal election , the democrats polled 11.1 percent of the senate vote and secured two seats . the party would retain a presence in the senate for the next 30 years , at its peak -lrb- between 1999 and 2002 -rrb- holding nine out of 76 seats , though never securing a seat in the lower house . source : the democratic party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the united states , along with its main rival , the republican party . tracing its heritage back to thomas jefferson and james madison 's democratic-republican party , the modern-day democratic party was founded around 1828 by supporters of andrew jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party.in its early years , the party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . since franklin d. roosevelt and his new deal coalition in the 1930s , the democratic party has promoted a social liberal platform . well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and southern conservative-populist wings ; following the new deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the south . source : the democratic party -lrb- chinese : 民主黨 ; dp -rrb- is a centre-left liberal political party in hong kong established in 1994 . chaired by legislator wu chi-wai , it is currently the third largest party in the legislative council of hong kong , having seven seats and 89 district councillors . it is also the largest pro-democracy party in the legislature . the party was founded in 1994 as a merger of the united democrats of hong kong -lrb- udhk -rrb- and the meeting point -lrb- mp -rrb- .

last friday , north korea conducted a successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that appears capable of reaching american cities , including seattle , los angeles and chicago . this new development is a cause for concern , but not panic or rash aggressive action . the greater danger faced by both the us and the region is the reaction of president donald trump to this development . the existence of a nuclear power with the capability of striking the united states is an inherent threat , but it is one that the us has lived with for decades . source : the trump administration has said it 's ready to unleash american military might to back its diplomacy when it comes to preventing north korea from developing a nuclear missile capable of hitting the united states . but there is no easy military solution to the crisis and several of the options potentially under consideration could risk thousands of lives . us officials told cnn last month that revised military options for north korea have been prepared and were ready to be presented to president donald trump . `` what we have to do is prepare all options because the president has made clear to us that he will not accept a nuclear power in north korea and a threat that can target the united states and target the american population , '' national security adviser h.r. source : north korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile friday that appears to have the range to hit major us cities , experts say , and prompted a fresh round of condemnation from the united states , china , japan and south korea . a combination of us , south korean and japanese analyses of the launch from mupyong-ni , near north korea 's border with china , shows the missile flew about 45 minutes , going 3,700 kilometers -lrb- 2,300 miles -rrb- high and for a distance of 1,000 kilometers -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- . if the missile were fired on a flatter , standard trajectory , it would have major us cities such as los angeles , denver and chicago well within its range , with the possible ability to reach as far as new york and boston , according to david wright , a missile expert at the union of concerned scientists . however , early analysis of friday 's test can not determine how heavy a payload the missile was carrying in its warhead , wright said .
ken burns and i decided to remaster the civil war for several reasons . first of all when we completed the film in 1989 , we were operating under a very tight schedule and budget . as the main editor on the film , i always wanted to go back and improve the overall quality of the film . the other reason for remastering the film at this time is that the technology to color correct , print and transfer a film to video for broadcast has vastly improved , especially in the realm of digital computer technology ... we also were able to eliminate a great deal of the dust and dirt that often get embedded into 16 mm film when it is printed . source : there 's no better time to be born in cleveland , where the indians are seeking their first world series title since 1948 . just ask the families of the little sluggers born this week in cleveland clinic 's fairview hospital . the world-famous hospital is getting into the spirit by bundling newborns in cleveland indians onesies for the duration of the championship . hopefully , none of them are chicago cubs fans . source : steve jobs contacted burns to obtain the filmmaker 's permission to use the term `` ken burns effect '' for apple 's video production software -lrb- the description had been apple 's internal working title while the feature was in development -rrb- . burns initially declined , saying that he did not allow his name to be used for commercial purposes . instead , burns had jobs give him `` some equipment which we give to nonprofits '' in exchange for permission to use the term in apple products . -lsb- 13 -rsb-

kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music , in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual , a beatles record , for instance , can be appreciated both by the alabama truck driver and the young cambridge intellectual , because their `` emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects '' . he believed that the subconscious emotional reaction experienced by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form , and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue , placing emphasis on images and sound . -lsb- 219 -rsb- in a time magazine interview in 1975 , kubrick further stated : `` the essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated . when you say something directly , it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves . source : `` when you make a movie , it takes a few days just to get used to the crew , because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people . once you 're accustomed to them , the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors , and certainly in itself '' . -lsb- 243 -rsb- he also told biographer michel ciment : `` it 's invariably because the actors do n't know their lines , or do n't know them well enough . an actor can only do one thing at a time , and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he 's thinking about them , he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks . source : it certainly seems true that suleiman had seriously blundered in splitting the command three ways . he not only split command between piyale and mustafa , but he ordered both of them to defer to dragut when he arrived from tripoli . contemporary letters from spies in constantinople , however , suggest that the plan had always been to take fort st. elmo first . -lsb- 23 -rsb- in any case , for the turks to concentrate their efforts on it proved a crucial mistake .

the escalating us crackdown on cuba , venezuela and nicaragua is a fresh example of the selective morality and strategic expediency shaping president donald trump 's foreign policy . washington is cloaking its policies in its own geopolitical backyard in the language of human rights , democracy and freedom . yet trump 's transparent admiration for some of the world 's most ruthless leaders elsewhere leaves him facing charges of hypocrisy , inconsistency and of severing core us foreign policy principles . secretary of state mike pompeo declared wednesday that `` dictators perceive appeasement as weakness , not strength , '' as he announced measures meant to hammer cuba 's weak economy . source : the senate overwhelmingly voted to confirm retired gen. john abizaid as the new us ambassador to saudi arabia on wednesday , filling a post that has been vacant since the beginning of the trump presidency . the vote was 92-7 . abizaid , the former head of us central command , was nominated to the post by president donald trump in november 2018 . his confirmation will fill one key vacancy in the region -- the us embassy has been without an ambassador since joseph westphal left in early january 2017 . source : on tuesday , president donald trump vetoed a bipartisan congressional resolution that would have forced his administration to end military support for saudi arabia in the war in yemen . this resolution was the first time that congress has invoked the 1973 war powers resolution -lrb- often referred to as the `` war powers act '' -rrb- , which limits the president 's ability to commit us forces abroad without congressional approval . in addition to the significance of the veto itself , trump 's decision could lead to a supreme court ruling on the constitutionality of the war powers resolution , which would dramatically expand or limit the president 's power to use military force abroad . the war powers resolution was passed in 1973 -- in response to what was seen as the unilateral commitment of the executive branch to long-term military engagements in korea and vietnam .
in the moments after the news broke of the death of supreme court justice antonin scalia , senate gop leaders immediately made it clear they will not confirm a nominee from president barack obama to replace him and are prepared to wait until a new president is in office , keeping in line with tradition that dates back decades . at issue is the so-called thurmond rule -- an informal senate tradition named for the long-serving former south carolina republican sen. strom thurmond -- that says judicial nominations should not be considered in the period leading up to a presidential campaign . `` the fact of the matter is that it 's been standard practice over the last nearly 80 years that supreme court nominees are not nominated and confirmed during a presidential election year , '' said sen. charles grassley , r-iowa , who chairs the judiciary committee . related : justice antonin scalia 's death quickly sparks political battle the thurmond rule has been cited -- or conveniently used -- by members of both parties over the years to curb the flow of judicial nominations in an election year , as the party in charge of the senate works to keep as many lifetime judicial appointments as possible out of the hands of the sitting president from the opposite party . source : the obama administration did not wait long before working on options to replace the late justice antonin scalia on the supreme court . the process began saturday night with conference calls among the president 's legal team , followed by meetings sunday to begin drawing up a list of possible names , according to two people who have been involved in the past two obama supreme court nominations and remain close to the administration . the white house already has a small list of people for whom deep background research was done when they were finalists for the last two openings on the court or other top jobs , like attorney general . even though he is on the west coast for a summit with southeast asian leaders , obama has been in touch with his senior team to plot his supreme court nomination process , and white house officials have communicated with republicans and democrats on capitol hill , the white house said monday . source : sen. ted cruz is out with a new ad highlighting the importance of the supreme court in the presidential race just days after the sudden death of justice antonin scalia . the ad , released to supporters sunday night , does not mention scalia 's death , announced saturday . the ad is about the importance of supreme court nominations more generally . the cruz campaign did not immediately respond to a question about when the ad was cut .
it took 27 years to adopt the 1906 statute , during which time the public was made aware of many problems with foods and drugs in the u.s. muckraking journalists , such as samuel hopkins adams , targeted the patent medicine industry with its high-alcoholic content patent medicines , soothing syrups for infants with opium derivatives , and `` red clauses '' in newspaper contracts providing that patent medicine ads -lrb- upon which most newspapers of the time were dependent -rrb- would be withdrawn if the paper expressed support for food and drug regulatory legislation . the chief chemist of the bureau of chemistry , dr. harvey washington wiley , captured the country 's attention with his hygienic table studies , which began with a modest congressional appropriation in 1902 . the goal of the table trial was to study the human effects of common preservatives used in foods during a period of rapid changes in the food supply brought about by the need to feed cities and support an industrializing nation increasingly dependent on immigrant labor . wiley recruited young men to eat all their meals at a common table as he added increased `` doses '' of preservatives including borax , benzoate , formaldehyde , sulfites , and salicylates . source : the pure food and drug act of 1906 was the first of a series of significant consumer protection laws which was enacted by congress in the 20th century and led to the creation of the food and drug administration . its main purpose was to ban foreign and interstate traffic in adulterated or mislabeled food and drug products , and it directed the u.s. bureau of chemistry to inspect products and refer offenders to prosecutors . it required that active ingredients be placed on the label of a drug 's packaging and that drugs could not fall below purity levels established by the united states pharmacopeia or the national formulary . the jungle by upton sinclair , with its graphic and revolting descriptions of unsanitary conditions and unscrupulous practices rampant in the meatpacking industry , was an inspirational piece that kept the public 's attention on the important issue of unhygienic meat processing plants that later led to food inspection legislation . source : the nine new graphic warning labels were announced by the fda in june 2011 and were scheduled to be required to appear on packaging by september 2012 . the implementation date is uncertain , due to ongoing proceedings in the case of r.j. reynolds tobacco co. v. u.s. food and drug administration . -lsb- 53 -rsb- r.j. reynolds , lorillard , commonwealth brands inc. , liggett group llc and santa fe natural tobacco company inc. have filed suit in washington , d.c. federal court claiming that the graphic labels are an unconstitutional way of forcing tobacco companies to engage in anti-smoking advocacy on the government 's behalf . -lsb- 54 -rsb-
do n't expect president barack obama or republican presidential candidate mitt romney to talk about the issue of gun control in the wake of last week 's deadly mass shooting in aurora , colorado -- there 's little to gain from bringing up the issue . while gun rights issues are split along party lines , independents , who will determine the outcome of the election , are also divided over the issue . both men and their surrogates have steered clear of discussing thorny second amendment issues since the shootings . polls , such as one conducted by the pew research center in april , have found that 55 % of highly coveted independents feel it is `` more important to protect gun ownership than to control guns , '' with 40 % saying controlling gun ownership is more important . source : mitt romney has a reputation for pragmatism , deliberation and playing it safe . but if romney reveals his vice presidential pick this week , as the latest round of campaign chatter suggests , he 'll be throwing out the traditional campaign playbook that says a running mate should be announced around a national party convention for maximum impact , just as voters are starting to pay attention to the campaign . rarely has a presidential hopeful gone public with his running mate selection more than a week before his party 's convention . who will run with romney ? source : president barack obama 's re-election campaign spent millions of dollars over the past few weeks in an advertising blitz aimed at negatively defining gop challenger mitt romney -- an effort that , according to several national polls and political experts , has met with tepid results . those ads include a spot in heavy rotation with romney singing `` america the beautiful '' at a campaign event as out-of-context phrases from news reports such as `` outsourced jobs to india '' and `` had millions in a swiss bank account '' appear on the screen . according to vanderbilt university 's ad rating project , which polled 600 democrats , republicans and independents , 73 % said the ad was `` negative .

sen. kamala harris ended her 2020 presidential campaign on tuesday , an abrupt departure for a candidate who was once seen as a leading contender for the democratic nomination . the california democrat told her senior staff of the decision tuesday morning , and later sent an email to supporters and released a video on twitter . `` to you my supporters , my dear supporters , it is with deep regret -- but also with deep gratitude -- that i am suspending our campaign today , '' harris said in the video . `` but i want to be clear with you : i am still very much in this fight , '' harris continued . source : kamala harris fell as quickly as she rose . the california senator entered the 2020 presidential race in january a top contender for the democratic nomination , someone whose political chops after ascending from prosecutor to attorney general to senator instantly made her one of the top 2020 candidates . less than a year later , and exactly two months before the iowa caucuses , she exits as a candidate who failed to live up to the hype and was unable to raise enough money to keep her campaign going . harris ' abrupt decision on tuesday makes the senator the most high-profile candidate to date to drop out of the race to challenge president donald trump , and is the culmination of months of disjointed messaging , contentious infighting among top aides and severe money issues that plagued the campaign . source : former vice president joe biden said wednesday he would consider sen. kamala harris as a potential running mate , a day after she dropped out of the presidential race . `` of course i would , '' biden said . `` look , sen. harris has the capacity to be anything she wants to be . i mean it sincerely .

the initial plan of the fauna and flora preservation society was to establish a herd in kenya where another species of oryx already lived and flourished . the kenyan plan was dropped because of an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease , and the oryx destined for kenya were shipped to the phoenix zoo instead . -lsb- 2 -rsb- source : in 1996 , when she was 22 , ruby was shipped to the tulsa zoo to mate with a male elephant named sneezy -lrb- who still lives in tulsa -rrb- and lived in tulsa for about a year . when she became pregnant in 1997 , she was returned to phoenix . another female asian elephant , indu , was loaned from the houston zoo to be ruby 's birthing companion . indu still lives at the phoenix zoo . source : in its first years , the zoo hosted a captive breeding program -lrb- `` operation oryx '' -rrb- with the specific goal of reintroducing the almost extinct arabian oryx to the wild . -lsb- 25 -rsb- by the early 1990s this program was still one of only two programs -lrb- the other being the golden lion tamarin -rrb- to have gone through the full wilderness-zoo-wilderness sequence . -lsb- 7 -rsb- nine oryx had been caught or donated for the breeding program . however , two pairs were delayed , so the `` world herd '' was started in phoenix in 1963 with only five animals shipped to the zoo and two born quickly after .
the film presents a legal system where the precrime office gathers the images from the minds of the precogs then organizes them into a coherent order for display in front of a set of judges . the judges appear via video feeds , analyze the images , and according to cooper , they view the images , listen to anderton rattle off `` a string of legalistic verbiage '' , then give it a `` pro forma ratification .

'' -lsb- 494 -rsb- source : many commentators credit obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the great recession . -lsb- 514 -rsb- according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics , the obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his term . -lsb- 519 -rsb- in 2010 , obama signed into effect the dodd -- frank wall street reform and consumer protection act . passed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007 -- 08 , it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the united states since the regulatory reform that followed the great depression under democratic president franklin d. source : on september 24 , 2008 , after the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis , mccain announced that he was suspending his campaign to return to washington so he could help craft a $ 700 billion bailout package for the troubled financial industry , and he stated that he would not debate obama until congress passed the bailout bill . -lsb- 91 -rsb- despite this decision , mccain was portrayed as somebody not playing a significant role in the negotiations for the first version of the bill , which fell short of passage in the house . he eventually decided to attend the first presidential debate on september 26 , despite congress ' lack of immediate action on the bill . his ineffectiveness in the negotiations and his reversal in decision to attend the debates were seized upon to portray mccain as erratic in his response to the economy .
cnn rode the rails with former vice president joe biden as he took the train from washington to wilmington , delaware , following president donald trump 's inauguration . biden rode with his wife , jill . this is the first time in eight years that biden has taken the train with a ticket actually in his name . usually he rides with a ticket without a name for security reasons . source : on january 31 , 2007 , biden took his first steps into the presidential campaign , but his comments about other candidates overshadowed his entrance . -lsb- 62 -rsb- biden especially drew criticism in the popular press for his evaluation of senator barack obama ; -lsb- 63 -rsb- -lsb- 64 -rsb- biden was quoted in the new york observer as saying : `` i mean , you got the first mainstream african-american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy , ... i mean , that 's a storybook , man . '' -lsb- 65 -rsb- the audio of the interview , posted on the observer 's website , reportedly includes a significant pause after `` african-american '' which would drastically change the meaning of the statement . source : over joe biden 's 44 years in public office , the former vice president says he made roughly 8,000 round trips between his home state of delaware and washington dc -- or 2.1 million miles . today , he left washington on a one-way ticket . the avuncular biden , with a wide grin on his face , boarded amtrak train # 2166 at union station , bound for the station named in his honor : joseph r. biden , jr. . railroad station . `` back on amtrak , '' biden exclaimed as he boarded .
sexual assault allegations levied against president donald trump 's supreme court nominee have spurred intensive conversations at the white house over how to proceed , officials and advisers said on monday . judge brett kavanaugh was seen arriving to the west wing just past 10 a.m. et on monday , swiftly ducking into the building after stepping from a black suv . his arrival coincided with a new statement , released by the white house , in which the federal judge again denied the allegations of sexual assault . source : white house aides who steeled themselves for what president donald trump would say when he finally addressed the sexual assault allegation against his supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh were quietly stunned when trump said the process should be followed and the accuser should be heard . in recent days , trump has bragged about the positive coverage he 's received for his response , according to multiple sources . that response has contributed to him continuing to say christine blasey ford should come forward with her story , they said . as of thursday , officials felt confident kavanaugh was back on track toward confirmation . source : democratic sen. kirsten gillibrand of new york knocked the gop 's handling of accusations against supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh , saying wednesday that the scheduled hearing for monday would be a `` sham . '' `` they are trying to create a sham hearing on monday , '' gillibrand told cnn 's jim acosta on `` the situation room . '' gillibrand said that without first deferring to an fbi investigation into the allegations of sexual assault brought by christine blasey ford against kavanaugh and requesting corroborating witnesses to testify , the senate judiciary committee 's approach would amount to a `` he said-she said '' that was unfair to ford . in a letter from her attorneys on tuesday , ford called for an fbi investigation into her allegations before she would testify to congress .
putin condemned the west 's reaction to the events in the crimea and sanctions against russian and ukrainian politicians . russian president expressed gratitude to the people of china , praised the restraint of india . appealed to the u.s. freedom-loving people , stressing that freedom of the crimean population is the same value . referring to the fact that not all allies sympathized with germany in 1989 , it merged with the german democratic republic , putin said that while the ussr supported the germans sincere desire for national unity . source : the ukrainian military said sunday that russian boats opened fire on and seized three of its ships near crimea , escalating a standoff over the kerch strait , a key waterway that holds strategic importance for both countries . the incident marks a major escalation in tensions between the two former soviet republics . on monday , ukrainian lawmakers will vote on whether to declare martial law , following a proposal by the country 's president petro poroshenko . an emergency united nations security council meeting has been called for monday to discuss the issue . source : a few days after the fifth anniversary of euromaidan -- the wave of demonstrations that kicked off in ukraine in november 2013 -- vessels belonging to the russian coast guard opened fire against three ukrainian navy ships , according to ukraine 's military , that were trying to pass through the strait of kerch . ukraine said the firefight ended with six of its servicemen wounded and russian special operations forces capturing the vessels , along with their crews of 23 . the captured ships and crews were then transported to a nearby russian base . the clash presents a dangerous new escalation in a conflict that has caused thousands of casualties and deaths since the 2014 illegal annexation of crimea by russia and the subsequent fighting that erupted in eastern ukraine .
on january 25 , senator robert byrd moved for dismissals of both articles of impeachment for lack of merit . on the following day , representative bryant moved to call witnesses to the trial , a question the senate had scrupulously avoided to that point . in both cases , the senate voted to deliberate on the question in private session , rather than public , televised procedure . on january 27 , the senate voted on both motions in public session ; the motion to dismiss failed on a nearly party line vote of 56 -- 44 , while the motion to depose witnesses passed by the same margin . source : the clinton -- lewinsky scandal was a united states political sex scandal that involved 49-year-old president bill clinton and 22-year-old white house intern monica lewinsky . the sexual relationship took place between 1995 and 1997 and came to light in 1998 . clinton ended a televised speech in late january 1998 with the statement that he `` did not have sexual relations with that woman , ms. lewinsky . '' source : on appeal , in the midst of his trial for impeachment based on his testimony in the jones case , clinton was faced with the prospect of having to go under oath again and testify more about his sexual history . instead , clinton agreed to an out-of-court settlement , paying jones and her lawyers $ 850,000 to drop the suit ; the vast majority of this money was used to pay jones ' legal fees . -lsb- 22 -rsb- clinton 's lawyer said that the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life . -lsb- 23 -rsb-
republican sen. lindsey graham is stuck once again between a president whose support he needs to win re-election and his lifelong friendship with the late arizona sen. john mccain , who encouraged all to put country first . but time and political necessity have softened graham 's public grievances with president donald trump . the presidential embrace has been months in the making . beginning with golf outings with trump , graham now frequently takes calls from the president . source : senate republicans find themselves boxed-in in the wake of president donald trump 's renewed attacks on the late sen. john mccain , unwilling to strongly stand up to a president who is widely popular with gop base voters but still deeply uncomfortable with his criticism of the late war hero and , for many in the chamber , a friend . that fine line republicans are walking was on display this week when only a few of them weighed in on trump 's sustained assault on mccain and those who did speak out issued tepid statements that praised mccain 's military and political service to the country but stopped short of criticizing trump for his harsh rhetoric . the clearest example of this came from sen. lindsey graham , a south carolina republican , who is known as mccain 's soul mate in the senate but who is also up for re-election in 2020 and in need of trump 's continued political backing . speaking in a subdued voice , he told wlos tv in spartanburg wednesday that he is not happy with trump 's attacks on mccain but that , `` i 'll try to continue to help the president . '' source : in his latest attack on john mccain , president donald trump accused the late senator of misleading the white house about his vote on a gop effort to repeal the affordable care act in 2017 after spending years campaigning on repealing it . facts first : trump falsely accused mccain of misleading the white house over his intention to vote on the gop drafted bill to repeal obamacare -- but mccain on several occasions publicly expressed his opposition prior to the vote . mccain did , however , campaign on repealing it . mccain 's actions in the days , and even the hours leading up to his dramatic decision to come down against the republican attempt to undo the law known as obamacare , call into question trump 's version of events leading up to the vote .
while considering wilkins 's effort naïve , borges ultimately praises the ambition of a universal language and admits that wilkins 's word for salmon , zana , could -lrb- for someone well-versed in wilkins 's language -rrb- hold more meaning than the corresponding words in conventional languages , which are arbitrary and carry no intrinsic meaning . he says that , `` theoretically , it is not impossible to think of a language where the name of each thing says all the details of its destiny , past and future . '' source : john wilkins , -lrb- 1614 -- 1672 -rrb- was an anglican clergyman , natural philosopher and author , and was one of the founders of the royal society . he was bishop of chester from 1668 until his death . wilkins is one of the few persons to have headed a college at both the university of oxford and the university of cambridge . he was a polymath , although not one of the most important scientific innovators of the period . source : in 1654 , wilkins joined with seth ward in writing vindiciae academiarum , a reply to john webster 's academiarum examen , one of many attacks at the time on the universities of oxford and cambridge , and their teaching methods . this attack had more clout than most : it was dedicated to john lambert , a top military figure , and was launched during barebone 's parliament , when radical change seemed on the cards . wilkins -lrb- as ns -rrb- provided an open letter to ward ; and ward -lrb- as hd , also taking the final letters of his name therefore -rrb- replied at greater length . wilkins makes two main points : first , webster is not addressing the actual state of the universities , which were not as wedded to old scholastic ways , aristotle , and galen , as he said ; and secondly webster 's mixture of commended authors , without fuller understanding of the topics , really was foolish .

just as the ghostly apparitions of the film 's fictional overlook hotel would play tricks on the mind of poor jack torrance , so too has the passage of time changed the perception of the shining itself . many of the same reviewers who lambasted the film for `` not being scary '' enough back in 1980 now rank it among the most effective horror films ever made , while audiences who hated the film back then now vividly recall being `` terrified '' by the experience . the shining has somehow risen from the ashes of its own bad press to redefine itself not only as a seminal work of the genre , but perhaps the most stately , artful horror ever made . -lsb- 66 -rsb- source : the mafia have learned of the construction of a new civic center , and have bought up all the land at the intended building site except for a karate dojo owned by pop byrd -lrb- scatman crothers -rrb- , who refuses to give up his property . the don contacts an indebted drug dealer named pinky , who had laundered $ 250,000 from the mafia that he 'd subsequently loaned to pop byrd in-order to get the dojo built . the don orders pinky to either get his money back or repossess the property . black belt jones -lrb- jim kelly -rrb- , an expert martial artist and hand-for-hire , is contacted by his old friend pop to help protect the dojo . source : if jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth , of course his body was found -- and sooner rather than later , since dick hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel . if jack 's body was not found , what happened to it ? was it never there ? was it absorbed into the past and does that explain jack 's presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel party-goers in 1921 ?
the white house is the official residence and workplace of the president of the united states . it is located at 1600 pennsylvania avenue nw in washington , d.c. and has been the residence of every u.s. president since john adams in 1800 . the term `` white house '' is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers . source : when bill clinton took office as president in january 1993 , hillary rodham clinton became the first lady . her press secretary reiterated she would be using that form of her name . -lsb- c -rsb- she was the first in this role to have a postgraduate degree and her own professional career up to the time of entering the white house . -lsb- 146 -rsb- she was also the first to have an office in the west wing of the white house in addition to the usual first lady offices in the east wing . source : assistant to the president became a rank generally shared by the chief of staff with such senior aides as deputy chiefs of staff , the white house counsel , the white house press secretary , and others . this new system did not catch on immediately . democrats kennedy and johnson still relied on their appointments secretaries instead , and it was not until the nixon administration that the chief of staff took over maintenance of the president 's schedule . this concentration of power in the nixon and ford white house -lrb- whose last chief of staff was dick cheney -rrb- led presidential candidate jimmy carter to campaign in 1976 with the promise that he would not appoint a chief of staff .
president barack obama reached out to the man who is expected to be the next senate majority leader after tuesday night 's republican midterm wins , and left a message . obama tried to connect with sen. mitch mcconnell , after the kentucky republican won his own re-election and his party won back control of the upper chamber , in order to congratulate him and left a message , a white house official tells cnn . aides for mcconnell said the white house called early wednesday morning and mcconnell was already gone . the white house official says the administration , including obama , are clear eyed about the results of the election . source : after a campaign season marked mainly by democrats fleeing his shadow , president barack obama embarked upon the final push of what he calls his last campaign sunday , hoping to mobilize voters in the few pockets of the country where he remains somewhat popular . obama headlined afternoon campaign rallies for democratic gubernatorial candidates in connecticut and pennsylvania , capping off a cycle that saw him rally for only one senate candidate and a handful of governors . his diminished presence in 2014 amounted mostly to headlining high-dollar fundraisers in wealthy neighborhoods , mostly on the coasts , where he sought to motivate donors amid bleak prospects for his party in tuesday 's midterm elections . in tight races across the country , democrats have distanced themselves from his policies , declaring themselves independent from the white house as republicans worked overtime to lump them into the same unpopular mold . source : president barack obama walked into the white house nearly six years ago with a robust senate majority and a promise to change politics . now , he 's heading into his final years of office estranged from democrats in the minority on capitol hill , facing republicans uninterested in making big compromises and a public that has largely moved on from the heady early days of the administration . obama is `` anxious to get back to work '' and put the midterms behind him , according to a white house official who spoke on the condition of anonymity , adding the president regards the final two years of his term as a `` fourth quarter '' with the potential for real action . he is scheduled to address the midterm results on wednesday afternoon , just as he did in 2010 when he labeled the republican takeover the house a `` shellacking .

president barack obama spent part of monday hobnobbing with celebrities and other power-brokers in southern california , continuing a west coast trip that includes town-hall events , a meeting with marines and fund-raisers for his re-election campaign . it was not all fund-raising , though , as the president started his day in northern california . that included a morning stop in mountain view for a forum at the computer history museum . obama then jetted to san diego , where he landed at the marine air corps station in miramar . source : in february 2009 , the cullman times , an alabama newspaper , reported that at a town hall meeting there , u.s. senator from alabama richard shelby was asked if there was any truth to the rumors that obama was not a natural-born citizen . according to the times report , shelby said , `` well his father was kenyan and they said he was born in hawaii , but i have n't seen any birth certificate . you have to be born in america to be president . source : on june 4 , john mccain proposed a series of ten joint town hall meetings with obama , at which the two could engage each other . -lsb- 32 -rsb- obama first agreed in principle to the notion , -lsb- 33 -rsb- but later rejected mccain 's proposal , offering instead one town-hall event on the independence day holiday and four traditional debate-style joint appearances . -lsb- 34 -rsb- -lsb- 35 -rsb- hank paulson , president bush 's treasury secretary , said obama 's comprehension of the financial crisis compared to mccain 's was as broad as `` night and day '' . mccain 's confidence vastly lowered when obama questioned his ideas on the financial crisis in a meeting on september 25 at the white house with bush and other congressmen .
some of the protests were partially in response to several federal laws : the bush administration 's emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 , -lsb- 98 -rsb- and the obama administration 's economic stimulus package the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 -lsb- 99 -rsb- -lsb- 100 -rsb- and healthcare reform legislation . -lsb- 101 -rsb- the bailouts of banks by the bush and obama administrations triggered the tea party 's rise , according to political analyst scott rasmussen . tea party participants `` think federal spending , deficits and taxes are too high , and they think no one in washington is listening to them , and that latter point is really , really important , '' rasmussen said . -lsb- 102 -rsb- source : the tea party movement focuses on a significant reduction in the size and scope of the government . -lsb- 3 -rsb- the movement advocates a national economy operating without government oversight . -lsb- 22 -rsb- movement goals include limiting the size of the federal government , reducing government spending , lowering the national debt and opposing tax increases . -lsb- 23 -rsb- to this end , tea party groups have protested the troubled asset relief program -lrb- tarp -rrb- , stimulus programs such as the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 -lrb- arra , commonly referred to as the stimulus or the recovery act -rrb- , cap and trade environmental regulations , health care reform such as the patient protection and affordable care act -lrb- ppaca , also known simply as the affordable care act or `` obamacare '' -rrb- and perceived attacks by the federal government on their 1st , 2nd , 4th and 10th amendment rights . source : despite the caucus members differing degrees of economic and social conservatism , they generally work to promote positions within the house of representatives that are to the right-of those of the house republican conference . -lsb- 37 -rsb- caucus members are an important swing vote on spending bills and as a result have gained influence in congress out of proportion to their numbers . -lsb- 38 -rsb- -lsb- 39 -rsb- they are frequently sought after to broker compromises amongst the republican leadership , generally lending a more right-wing character to u.s. politics .
the 2012 presidential election is only five days away . there is no rest for the candidates as they race to win critical votes in the battleground states . iowa is one of the final battlegrounds . president obama and mitt romney are both aiming to sway `` religious voters '' in the hawkeye state . source : the frenetic pace of presidential campaigning that has crested in the last few days -- in which the candidates or their surrogates hit 10 states -- wo n't end when voters go to the polls on tuesday . republican candidate mitt romney will campaign in two states on election day - ohio and pennsylvania - according to a romney campaign official . campaigning on election day , a senior romney adviser says , will help `` keep the energy going '' until the polls close . the idea is that the campaign is `` just going to keep working up until the polls close , '' said the same romney adviser . source : as the presidential candidates head into their final day of campaigning , both president obama and mitt romney are focusing on the biggest prizes : the elusive swing states . cnn currently lists pennsylvania as likely to `` lean obama , '' but both campaigns are fighting for the keystone state . just one day after mitt romney took the stage in pennsylvania , president obama is deploying bill clinton to the state for four campaign states . sen. pat toomey -lrb- r-pa -rrb- , who campaigned with both romney and paul ryan this weekend , weighs in on the final push for his state on `` starting point '' today .
