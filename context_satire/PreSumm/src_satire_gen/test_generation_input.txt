variety held a q&a with most of the original writing staff to reflect on the show 's run , the final season , the writing process and alternative endings . along with creator vince gilligan , fellow writers and producers peter gould , thomas schnauz , gennifer hutchison , moira walley-beckett , sam catlin and george mastras joined to discuss memories from the show 's humble beginnings , character transformations that concluded in the final season as well as surprising developments along the way . for instance , the character of jesse pinkman was originally supposed to die halfway through season one in a tragic drug deal gone horribly wrong . the reasoning behind this decision was that jesse served his purpose `` in a meat-and-potatoes , logistical sense . gilligan wrote the scene of walter white and jesse sitting in the diner in a light-hearted tone , with the intention of providing one last chance to see the two characters together as a final treat for the fans . producer melissa bernstein suggested adding a bit more gravitas to the scene in order to let it resonate further with the audiences . gilligan left most of the scene from the original script intact , but he and bernstein were able to come up with the line `` you 're really lucky , you know that ? that you did n't have to wait your whole life to do something special '' , tying the scene to the film 's theme of jesse finally taking control of his life . the writers of breaking bad created the character of mike ehrmantraut as a substitute for saul goodman , when actor bob odenkirk was unavailable for the last of four planned breaking bad episodes of the second season because of a commitment to appear in how i met your mother . they cast jonathan banks because they admired his work in the 1980s police drama wiseguy . banks himself thought he would come on and do the role for the second season finale `` abq '' , but had been impressed by working alongside aaron paul in that scene , and with the overall direction that vince gilligan had given for the episode once it aired . banks considered his character close to that of max von sydow 's joubert from three days of the condor , an assassin that painted figurines on the side .
a 2014 study of the effects of the oil spill on bluefin tuna funded by national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- , stanford university , and the monterey bay aquarium and published in the journal science , found that the toxins from oil spills can cause irregular heartbeats leading to cardiac arrest . calling the vicinity of the spill `` one of the most productive ocean ecosystems in the world '' , the study found that even at very low concentrations `` pah cardiotoxicity was potentially a common form of injury among a broad range of species in the vicinity of the oil . '' another peer-reviewed study , released in march 2014 and conducted by 17 scientists from the united states and australia and published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , found that tuna and amberjack that were exposed to oil from the spill developed deformities of the heart and other organs that would be expected to be fatal or at least life-shortening . the scientists said that their findings would most likely apply to other large predator fish and `` even to humans , whose developing hearts are in many ways similar . '' in may 2010 , a local native set up a network for people to volunteer their assistance in cleaning up beaches . boat captains were given the opportunity to offer the use of their boat to help clean and prevent the oil from further spreading . to assist with the efforts the captains had to register their ships with the vessels of opportunity , however an issue arose when more boats registered than actually participated in the clean up efforts - only a third of the registered boats . many local supporters were disappointed with bp 's slow response , prompting the formation of the florida key environmental coalition . on 4 september 2014 , u.s. district judge carl barbier ruled bp was guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct . he described bp 's actions as `` reckless . '' he said transocean 's and halliburton 's actions were `` negligent . '' he apportioned 67 % of the blame for the spill to bp , 30 % to transocean , and 3 % to halliburton .
according to hecht biographer , william macadams , `` at dawn on sunday , february 20 , 1939 , david selznick ... and director victor fleming shook hecht awake to inform him he was on loan from mgm and must come with them immediately and go to work on gone with the wind , which selznick had begun shooting five weeks before . it was costing selznick $ 50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting for a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence . hecht was in the middle of working on the film at the circus for the marx brothers . recalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend gene fowler , he said he had n't read the novel but selznick and director fleming could not wait for him to read it . hecht left by plane from new york city to hollywood on monday , november 2 , his position on the film already confirmed . once in california , he interviewed 200 girls and 150 men , in order to find the twelve girls and six men necessary for the dance numbers . hecht hired frances grant , fresh from assisting larry ceballos at fanchon and marco , to help him with the new routines on chi chi and her papas . but a week after hecht 's arrival , the film was put on hold . to compose the score , selznick chose max steiner , with whom he had worked at rko pictures in the early 1930s . warner bros. -- who had contracted steiner in 1936 -- agreed to lend him to selznick . steiner spent twelve weeks working on the score , the longest period that he had ever spent writing one , and at two hours and thirty-six minutes long it was also the longest that he had ever written . five orchestrators were hired , including hugo friedhofer , maurice de packh , bernard kaun , adolph deutsch and reginald bassett .

sharp was born in westminster , london , and was raised traveling throughout europe and the southwest of the united states in a caravan , before moving to devon , england , age eight . he was educated by his mother , a teacher , and his father , who worked in real estate , until the family moved to england . he has a sister , nicole , also highly successful in her own field . his mother homeschooled him with both `` rigorous and unorthodox '' lessons . after the three releases in the songs about time series in april , july , and october 2009 , sharp and the rentals went on hiatus . in october 2010 , sharp sold most of his equipment from his weezer and rentals days on ebay . his orange matamp lead 200 was purchased by greg veerman , bassist of canadian rock band san sebastian . in november 2010 , cuomo mentioned in an interview with spin that `` the idea came up '' of having sharp rejoin the band for their `` memories tour '' , in which they play the blue album and pinkerton . argonne began in 1942 as the `` metallurgical laboratory '' at the university of chicago , which became part of the manhattan project . the met lab built chicago pile-1 , the world 's first nuclear reactor , under the stands of a university of chicago sports stadium . considered unsafe , in 1943 , cp-1 was reconstructed as cp-2 , in what is today known as red gate woods but was then the argonne forest of the cook county forest preserve district near palos hills . the lab was named after the surrounding argonne forest , which in turn was named after the forest of argonne in france where u.s. troops fought in world war i. fermi 's pile was originally going to be constructed in the argonne forest , and construction plans were set in motion , but a labor dispute brought the project to a halt .
the political crisis of 1988 -- 89 was testimony to both the party 's strength and its weakness . in the wake of a succession of issues -- the pushing of a highly unpopular consumer tax through the diet in late 1988 , the recruit insider trading scandal , which tainted virtually all top ldp leaders and forced the resignation of prime minister takeshita noboru in april -lrb- a successor did not appear until june -rrb- , the resignation in july of his successor , uno sōsuke , because of a sex scandal , and the poor showing in the upper house election -- the media provided the japanese with a detailed and embarrassing dissection of the political system . by march 1989 , popular support for the takeshita cabinet as expressed in public opinion polls had fallen to 9 percent . uno 's scandal , covered in magazine interviews of a `` kiss and tell '' geisha , aroused the fury of female voters . this is a list of war apology statements issued by the state of japan with regard to the war crimes committed by the empire of japan during world war ii . the statements were made at and after the end of world war ii in asia , from the 1950s to the 2010s . hashimoto became a key figure in the strong ldp faction founded by kakuei tanaka in the 1970s , which later fell into the hands of noboru takeshita , who then was tainted by the recruit scandal of 1988 . in 1991 , the press had discovered that one of hashimoto 's secretaries had been involved in an illegal financial dealing . hashimoto retired as minister of finance from the second kaifu cabinet . following the collapse of the bubble economy , the ldp momentarily lost power in 1993/94 during the hosokawa and hata anti-ldp coalition cabinets negotiated by ldp defector ichirō ozawa .
route 64 is a bus route operated by the maryland transit administration in baltimore and its suburbs . the line currently runs from the intersection of north avenue and st. paul street to curtis bay , with selected trips to energy parkway and riviera beach . the line also serves federal hill , port covington , and brooklyn . the bus route is the successor to the 6 curtis bay streetcar line . curtis bay is a residential / commercial / industrial neighborhood in the southern portion of the city of baltimore , maryland , united states . the neighborhood is on steep sloping heights , about four city blocks wide -lrb- west to east -rrb- and fifteen blocks long -lrb- north to south -rrb- and above and surrounded on three sides -lrb- northeast - east - southeast -rrb- in a highly industrialized waterfront area in the southern part of the city , and receives its name from the body -lrb- cove -rrb- of water to the east in which it sits . the cove of `` curtis bay '' with two small branches - stone house cove and cabin branch is fed from the southwest by curtis creek which in turn is formed further south by marley creek and furnace branch/creek in anne arundel county . adjoining nearby to the east is thoms cove near hawkins point at the north end of the marley neck peninsula . baltimore -lrb- bawl-tim-or , locally : -rrb- is the most populous city in the u.s. state of maryland , as well as the 30th most populous city in the united states , with a population of 602,495 in 2018 and also the largest such independent city in the country . baltimore was established by the constitution of maryland as an independent city in 1729 . as of 2017 , the population of the baltimore metropolitan area was estimated to be just under 2.802 million , making it the 21st largest metropolitan area in the country . baltimore is located about 40 miles -lrb- 64 km -rrb- northeast of washington , d.c. , making it a principal city in the washington-baltimore combined statistical area -lrb- csa -rrb- , the fourth-largest csa in the nation , with a calculated 2018 population of 9,797,063 . the city 's inner harbor was once the second leading port of entry for immigrants to the united states .
although poniatowski protested against the first partition of the commonwealth -lrb- 1772 -rrb- , he was powerless to do anything about it . he considered abdication , but decided against it . during the partition sejm of 1773 -- 1775 , in which russia was represented by ambassador otto von stackelberg , with no allied assistance forthcoming from abroad and with the armies of the partitioning powers occupying warsaw to compel the sejm by force of arms , no alternative was available save submission to their will . eventually poniatowski and the sejm acceded to the `` partition treaty '' . upon his accession to the throne , he had hopes of marrying catherine ii , writing to her on 2 november 1763 in a moment of doubt , `` if i desired the throne , it was because i saw you on it . '' when she made it clear through his envoy rzewuski that she would not marry him , there were hopes of an austrian archduchess , archduchess maria elisabeth of austria -lrb- 1743 -- 1808 -rrb- . a marriage to princess sophia albertina of sweden was suggested despite the religious differences , but this match was opposed by his sisters , ludwika maria poniatowska and izabella poniatowska , and nothing came of it . the ceremonial role of queen and hostess of his court was played by his favourite niece , urszula zamoyska . george sanford notes that the constitution gave poland `` a constitutional monarchy close to the english model of the time . '' according to a contemporary account , poniatowski himself described it , as `` founded principally on those of england and the united states of america , but avoiding the faults and errors of both , and adapted as much as possible to the local and particular circumstances of the country . '' the constitution of 3 may remained to the end a work in progress . a new civil and criminal code -lrb- provisionally called the `` stanisław augustus code '' -rrb- was among the proposals .
the significance of the term mit ` a goes beyond that of the system for organizing labor . it contains a certain andean philosophical concept of eternal repetition . the constellation of the pleiades , called cabrillas -lrb- `` little goats '' -rrb- by the spaniards , were known as unquy -lrb- quechua for `` disease '' , hispanicized oncoy -rrb- during the rainy season mit ` a , and as qullqa -lrb- quechua for `` storehouse '' -rrb- during the season of harvest and abundance . the seasons were divided into the dry mit ` a and the rainy mit ` a . in the late 1960s , minsky 's artificial intelligence group was seeking more space , and was unable to get satisfaction from project director licklider . university space-allocation politics being what it is , minsky found that although project mac as a single entity could not get the additional space he wanted , he could split off to form his own laboratory and then be entitled to more office space . as a result , the mit ai lab was formed in 1970 , and many of minsky 's ai colleagues left project mac to join him in the new laboratory , while most of the remaining members went on to form the laboratory for computer science . talented programmers such as richard stallman , who used teco to develop emacs , flourished in the ai lab during this time . as of 2017 , mit was the second-largest employer in the city of cambridge . based on feedback from employees , mit was ranked # 7 as a place to work , among us colleges and universities as of march 2013 . surveys cited a `` smart '' , `` creative '' , `` friendly '' environment , noting that the work-life balance tilts towards a `` strong work ethic '' but complaining about `` low pay '' compared to an industry position .
president donald trump capped off his dramatic appearance at the annual nato summit in brussels , belgium , on thursday by teasing another controversial possibility , saying he would not rule out ceasing nato military exercises in the baltic states if russian leader vladimir putin requested it during their upcoming meeting in helsinki , finland . asked if he would cancel them , trump said , `` perhaps we 'll talk about that , '' referring to putin , a response that has only fueled the the growing uncertainty over the state of the alliance . despite trump 's barrage of acidic rhetoric during the summit , diplomats said the president never explicitly threatened to leave nato and it remains unclear whether he has the power to do so without senate approval . however , trump 's comments about possibly canceling nato military exercises at putin 's request have amplified fears among european leaders that the president could undermine the alliance by making major unilateral concessions to the russian president -- who he again referred to as a `` competitor '' rather than an adversary on thursday . wriggling his backside further into the velvet luxury of the 19th century armchair , vladimir putin could be forgiven a sigh of satisfaction . he mirthlessly smiled at an exchange on russia 1 's `` 60 minutes '' political panel discussion as it dissected his recent summit with donald trump . leonid kalashnikov -lrb- russian state duma -rrb- : `` america is to blame for the deterioration in relations , he wrote this on twitter even before the meeting ! '' evgeny popov -lrb- host -rrb- : `` look , it 's really strange , he 's the president of that exact country , how can he say that ... this week , president donald trump will travel to the nato summit in brussels . america 's allies will pay close attention to his every word and seek strong reassurances that the united states will continue to play a leading role in the critical alliance . we sincerely hope he provides those reassurances . nato is not , as trump has stated , taking advantage of the united states .
sat is the first problem that was proven to be np-complete ; see cook -- levin theorem . this means that all problems in the complexity class np , which includes a wide range of natural decision and optimization problems , are at most as difficult to solve as sat . there is no known algorithm that efficiently solves each sat problem , and it is generally believed that no such algorithm exists ; yet this belief has not been proven mathematically , and resolving the question of whether sat has a polynomial-time algorithm is equivalent to the p versus np problem , which is a famous open problem in the theory of computing . mccarthy saw the importance of mathematics and mathematics education . his usenet . sig for years was , `` he who refuses to do arithmetic is doomed to talk nonsense '' ; his license plate cover read , similarly , `` do the arithmetic or be doomed to talk nonsense . '' he advised 30 phd graduates . he helped to motivate the creation of project mac at mit when he worked there , and at stanford university , he helped establish the stanford ai laboratory , for many years a friendly rival to project mac .
things went smoothly for the business for several years until the hoots family learned of the burger king in florida and that company 's plans for illinois . the hoots and their lawyer thought their state trademark , which was in use before the florida chain moved into the state , gave them exclusive rights to the `` burger king '' name all over the state . however , the florida chain opened its first illinois restaurant in skokie -lrb- a chicago suburb -rrb- in 1961 ; by 1967 , the chain had 50 restaurants in illinois , and the hootses felt they needed to take action . those in the lifeboats were horrified to hear the sound of what lawrence beesley called `` every possible emotion of human fear , despair , agony , fierce resentment and blind anger mingled -- i am certain of those -- with notes of infinite surprise , as though each one were saying , ` how is it possible that this awful thing is happening to me ? that i should be caught in this death trap ? ' '' jack thayer compared it to the sound of `` locusts on a summer night '' , while george rheims , who jumped moments before titanic sank , described it as `` a dismal moaning sound which i wo n't ever forget ; it came from those poor people who were floating around , calling for help . it was horrifying , mysterious , supernatural . '' the sandwich came at a time when there was a great deal of animosity between the chain and its franchises over its buck double promotion , which was driving average checks and profits . the buck double had been running for since october 2010 to the introduction of the xt , eventually had taken upwards 10 % of all sales in the restaurants -- cannibalizing sales from other higher priced items . combined with the ongoing economic downturn at the time , the value - oriented promotion had sent overall profits for the chain down by as much as 3.3 % . the introduction was seen as a way to help stop the sales slide and prop up the chain 's flagging sales .
the midwestern united states , also referred to as the american midwest , middle west , or simply the midwest , is one of four census regions of the united states census bureau -lrb- also known as `` region 2 '' -rrb- . it occupies the northern central part of the united states . it was officially named the north central region by the census bureau until 1984 . it is located between the northeastern united states and the western united states , with canada to its north and the southern united states to its south .
in 1970 , saatchi , with his brother , formed the advertising agency saatchi and saatchi . they are credited with a number of successful advertising campaigns , most notably the `` labour is n't working '' posters on behalf of the conservative party for the 1979 british general election and advertisements for the cigarette brand silk cut . maurice saatchi served as chairman of the firm which by 1986 -- following its acquisition of advertising firm ted bates -- had grown to be the largest ad agency in the world , with over 600 offices . in 1997 , saatchi & saatchi officially dropped `` advertising '' from its name . this was part of an imperative installed by kevin roberts , a beverage marketing veteran brought in to revive the agency 's fortunes . a significant decision of his was to move the global headquarters of the agency from its charlotte street , london address to its hudson st , new york city office . newly dubbed an `` ideas company '' by roberts , the agency sought to usher its resources towards the internet , still very much in its infancy in 1997 . in 1970 , he started the advertising agency saatchi & saatchi with his brother maurice , which by 1986 -- following its acquisition of advertising firm ted bates -- had grown to be the largest ad agency in the world , with over 600 offices . successful campaigns in the uk included silk cut 's advertisements in preparation for the ban on named tobacco advertising , and the conservative party 's 1979 general election victory -- led by margaret thatcher through the slogan `` labour is n't working '' .
sven elverfeld does n't get out much . the german chef , who heads aqua at the ritz-carlton in wolfsburg , is not one of those culinary libertines who spend half the year in the skies , leaving their underlings to knock out the tournedos and timbales at home while they stage pop-ups and guest appearances at fun locations abroad . if he 's away for more than a few days , the aqua kitchen goes dark -- which is maybe one reason why it 's held on to its three michelin stars since 2009 . but elverfeld has trusted his team to keep the hobs burning for the best part of a week as he makes the 13-hour trek to thailand for the second gelinaz shuffle , an ambitious , slightly crazy project in which 40 of the world 's top chefs take over each other 's kitchens on the same night . after the cancellation of baywatch nights , mitch continued on the original series , now promoted to captain . nights was once more alluded to in a tongue-in-cheek manner in the season 8 episode , `` eel nino , '' where an electric eel had been terrorizing beachgoers . when some of the lifeguards -lrb- not yet knowing it was an electric eel -rrb- , speculated that it could be an alien , mitch , annoyed , told them , `` this is not the x-files . '' the series then returned to a reasonably more realistic format from that point on . in 2005 , albom and four editors were briefly suspended from the detroit free press after albom wrote a column that stated that two college basketball players were in the crowd at an ncaa tournament game when in fact they were not . in a column printed in the april 3 , 2005 edition , albom described two former michigan state basketball players , both then in the nba , attending an ncaa final four semifinal game on saturday to cheer for their school . the players had told albom they planned to attend , so albom , filing on his normal friday deadline but knowing the column could not come out until sunday -lrb- after the game was over -rrb- wrote that the players were there . but the players ' plans changed at the last minute and they did not attend the game .
msu has a variety of campus media outlets . the student-run newspaper is the state news and free copies are available online or at east lansing newsstands . the paper prints 28,500 copies from monday through friday during the fall and spring semesters , and 15,000 copies monday through friday during the summer . the paper is not published on weekends , holidays , or semester breaks , but is continually updated online at statenews.com . the college became affiliated with michigan state university in 1995 to enhance the college 's curriculum and reputation . it relocated to east lansing in 1997 , when its 99-year lease with the detroit ymca expired , and the original building was demolished to make way for comerica park . the newly located college was called `` detroit college of law at michigan state university '' . the affiliation was celebrated at a function where former president and michigan native gerald ford joined more than 2,500 guests at the wharton center for performing arts great hall . michigan is , by tradition , known as `` the wolverine state , '' and the university of michigan takes the wolverine as its mascot . the association is well and long established : for example , many detroiters volunteered to fight during the american civil war and george armstrong custer , who led the michigan brigade , called them the `` wolverines '' . the origins of this association are obscure ; it may derive from a busy trade in wolverine furs in sault ste. marie in the 18th century or may recall a disparagement intended to compare early settlers in michigan with the vicious mammal .
stephen glass saw the film and , when reflecting about the experience , he said , `` it was very painful for me . it was like being on a guided tour of the moments of my life i am most ashamed of '' . during hausner 's half-hour ramble to the jury right before sentencing , he apologized to several people including his family . he stated that he ruined the family name , as people would hear the hausner name and think of charles manson . he even compared himself to charles manson . `` when you think of manson , 50 years from now you 'll think of hausner '' , he said . according to reports , police first identified dale hausner and samuel dieteman as suspects on july 31 , 2006 , through tips received from the community . the most important tips came from ron horton , who died before he could testify at trial . horton was a friend of dieteman , and alleged that dieteman confessed to involvement in the shootings when he was drunk at the star dust inn , his regular haunt . horton was initially uncertain if dieteman 's confession was serious , but nonetheless went to police after the shooting death of robin blasnek -lrb- 22 -rrb- of mesa , arizona , which he found upsetting and said `` affected me quite a bit '' .

the mountain was made famous internationally by tom hanks ' and steven spielberg 's television miniseries band of brothers , in which it was featured as a training site of the american paratroopers at camp toccoa , georgia , where they ran up and down currahee . the name of the mountain became a motto for these paratroopers , and inspired the quote `` three miles up , three miles down . '' the oconee national forest is almost halfway between macon and athens . there are two major man-made lakes within the boundaries of the oconee ranger district , both on the oconee river . lake sinclair lends its water and name to lake sinclair recreation area in putnam county . this is the major recreation area of the oconee ranger district and offers camping , boating , fishing and swimming . ranger roscoe nicholson , who was the first forest ranger in georgia and had advised the forest service in its initial land purchases , continued the growth of the chattahoochee by negotiating the purchase of most of the forest service land in what is now the chattooga river ranger district . the coleman river scenic area near clayton , georgia was dedicated to `` ranger nick '' , as he was called , in honor of his promotion of conservation ideals .
france beat the united states in the men 's 4x100-meter swimming relay on sunday , with michael phelps and the united states taking a silver medal . the medal is the 17th for phelps , and puts him one behind larisa latynina , a soviet gymnast who earned nine golds , five silvers and four bronzes between 1956 and 1964 . the u.s. held the lead for three of the four legs , but yannick agnel caught ryan lochte just after the turn and pulled away at the end . france won in 3:09.93 , with the 20-year-old agnel swimming the last leg in 46.74 . gymnastics once again takes center -- or is it centre ? -- stage thursday when the women compete in the individual all-around . here 's what to look for in that and other top events : 1 -rrb- gymnastics : a new queen with world champion jordyn wieber excluded from the women 's individual all-around competition because she finished fourth , but third among americans , in a qualifying system that allows only two people per nation , the united states still has the favorite for gold . gabby douglas led the americans to the team title when she finished second in the vault , third on the floor , fourth on the balance beam and sixth on the uneven bars . the united states has injury worries on the track while the basketball team worries about a familiar foe . here are five things to watch at the olympics on friday : 1 -rrb- men 's 4x400 relay : u.s. hopes to continue streak the united states is lucky to be in the final , lucky , that is , that manteo mitchell found a way to finish his opening leg despite a broken fibula . the united states will have to find a replacement for him as they challenge the bahamas for the gold . also keep an eye on great britain , which will have most of the 80,000 fans at olympic stadium cheering for them .
before he departed office , president barack obama encouraged british prime minister theresa may to form a close relationship with incoming president donald trump , according to a british official familiar with their conversations and a former senior administration official . obama hoped she and other center-right leaders could act as a moderating and sobering force on the incoming us president and pressed her to remain in close contact with trump as he assumed the presidency , the officials said . obama 's conversations with may included during their final in-person meeting in berlin in november . may and trump are scheduled to meet friday at the white house , and both world leaders are expected to address the congressional republicans ' retreat in philadelphia on thursday . trump has said that he believes that `` torture absolutely works '' . during his campaign , trump said that `` i would bring back waterboarding , and i 'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding '' . however , since becoming president , he has not brought back waterboarding . several hours after the initial report by the washington post , the trump campaign released a video statement in response to the controversy , in which trump apologized , stating that `` anyone who knows me knows these words do n't reflect who i am . i said it , i was wrong , and i apologize . '' towards the end of the statement trump also said that `` there is a big difference between the words and actions '' , and then went on to say that `` bill clinton has actually abused women and hillary has bullied , attacked , shamed , and intimidated his victims '' . this apology was criticized severely by the media and members of the public as being insincere and attempting to divert the problem at hand with unsubstantiated accusations against his political opponents .
chapter 11 is a chapter of title 11 , the united states bankruptcy code , which permits reorganization under the bankruptcy laws of the united states . chapter 11 bankruptcy is available to every business , whether organized as a corporation , partnership or sole proprietorship , and to individuals , although it is most prominently used by corporate entities . in contrast , chapter 7 governs the process of a liquidation bankruptcy , though liquidation can be done under chapter 11 also ; while chapter 13 provides a reorganization process for the majority of private individuals . actress and singer tina yothers , best known for her role in the television series family ties , is featured in the episode as a celebrity judge in the school 's costume judging contest . about one year after the episode aired , stone met yothers at a venue where she was performing with her band . stone was uncomfortable because it was the first time he had met a celebrity the show previously mocked , but yothers said she was a big fan of the show and enjoyed her parody appearance . she used a clip of kyle saying `` up yours , tina yothers '' from the episode as an introductory sound clip to introduce her band 's shows . main stars meredith baxter and michael gross are exactly the same age , sharing the same birthday on june 21 , 1947 . in the series , their characters were intended to be approximately five or six years older , given that their `` son '' , played by michael j. fox , was in fact only fourteen years younger than baxter and gross in real life .
in a futuristic britain , alex delarge is the leader of a gang of `` droogs '' : georgie , dim and pete . one night , after getting intoxicated on drug-laden `` milk-plus '' , they engage in an evening of `` ultra-violence '' , which includes a fight with a rival gang . they drive to the country home of writer f. alexander and beat him to the point of crippling him for life . alex then rapes alexander 's wife while singing `` singin ' in the rain '' . after aversion therapy , alex behaves like a good member of society , though not through choice . his goodness is involuntary ; he has become the titular clockwork orange -- organic on the outside , mechanical on the inside . after alex has undergone the ludovico technique , the chaplain criticises his new attitude as false , arguing that true goodness must come from within . this leads to the theme of abusing liberties -- personal , governmental , civil -- by alex , with two conflicting political forces , the government and the dissidents , both manipulating alex purely for their own political ends . the effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated to a group of vips , who watch as alex collapses before a bully and abases himself before a scantily clad young woman whose presence has aroused his predatory sexual inclinations . although the prison chaplain accuses the state of stripping alex of free will , the government officials on the scene are pleased with the results and alex is released from prison .
static appears as a major character in the 2010 limited series milestone forever , a project designed to detail the final fates of the milestone launch characters prior to being assimilated into dc 's continuity . in static 's tale , the reader first learns that virgil is attending his ten year high school reunion , and has given up his life of crime-fighting and is now pursuing a career in medicine . rick -lrb- now going by his television moniker of `` richie '' -rrb- is also now working as a director in los angeles , and is open about his homosexuality . without warning , hotstreak -lrb- recently released from prison and now calling himself firewheel -rrb- , attacks the reunion , claiming that he now realizes that static must have been one of his old classmates . bradford city were struggling in the second division at the time of cowan 's signing , having won just one of their first ten games of the 1935 -- 36 season . cowan made his debut for them on 19 october 1935 in a 2 -- 2 draw with swindon town , but it was not until cowan 's third game that bradford won for the second time that season . cowan missed just three of the club 's remaining fixtures that season , playing 29 times in the league and three in the fa cup as city finished 12th . the following season , city again struggled . walsh felt that montgomery had become `` stronger '' and `` more centered '' between the first and the second season of private practice , `` initially she 's still getting her footing , still is n't quite sure and a little wobbly , and then you see that she 's got her groove back . '' additionally , walsh said of the character that `` she 's flawed and arrogant and really good at what she does . and no matter what happens , she picks herself up and moves on . she keeps trying . ''
during the buildup to their wedding green and barrymore frequently joked with the media about when and where they were going to wed. . the most notable incident came on november 18 , 2000 , when green hosted the american television show saturday night live . during the monologue , green brought barrymore on stage and teased the audience about the couple marrying at the end of the episode . ultimately , the stage was set for a wedding before barrymore , in the end , got `` cold feet '' and left green alone to end the show . deitch 's shorts were commercial successes . in 1961 , the tom and jerry series became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time , dethroning looney tunes , which had held the position for 16 years ; this success was repeated once more in 1962 . however , unlike the hanna-barbera shorts , none of deitch 's films were nominated for nor did they win an academy award . in retrospect , these shorts are often considered the worst of the tom and jerry theatrical output . deitch states that , being a `` upa man '' , he was not a fan of the tom and jerry cartoons , thinking they were `` needlessly violent '' . however , after being assigned to work on the series , he quickly realized that `` nobody took seriously '' , and it was merely `` a parody of exaggerated human emotions '' . he also came to see what he perceived as the `` biblical roots '' in tom and jerry 's conflict , similar to david and goliath , stating `` that 's where we feel a connection to these cartoons : the little guy can win -lrb- or at least survive -rrb- to fight another day .

imagine an immigration and customs enforcement official telling an undocumented immigrant mother waiting to request asylum that he is going to take her child to bathe or to get something to eat . imagine a mother requesting to comfort her screaming child as he is removed from her arms , only to have a border patrol agent laugh in her face . peter hirschman , a volunteer at keep tucson together , an organization run by community members who support immigration cases , says he was told about these situations . they have resulted from the trump administration 's zero-tolerance immigration policy that calls for the prosecution of all individuals who illegally enter the united states . a republican running for new jersey 's 2nd congressional district thinks diversity is `` a bunch of crap and un-american , '' according to comments he made in a video posted to youtube by a progressive super pac . `` in my view , the best way to bring diversity to the republican party is for republicans to openly say that the whole idea of diversity is a bunch of crap and un-american , '' seth grossman can be seen saying in the video uploaded on june 6 by american bridge 21st century , which monitors gop candidates . in the video , grossman goes on to quote the declaration of independence and says , `` the constitution was designed to incorporate that idea of the declaration of independence that everybody is treated equally under the law . now , what diversity has become , it 's been an excuse by democrats , communists and socialists , basically , to say that we 're not all created equal , that some people , if he -- if somebody is lesser qualified , they will get a job anyway , or they 'll get into college anyway because of the tribe that they 're with , what group , what box they fit into . '' the son of former brazilian professional footballer marcos pereira , andreas pereira was born in duffel , belgium , while his father was a player there . he began his career with nearby lommel united , one of his father 's former clubs , before moving just across the dutch border to psv eindhoven in 2005 , when he was nine years old . in 2011 , after impressing at the manchester united premier cup , he became a target for several big english clubs , including arsenal , chelsea and liverpool , but a visit from manchester united manager alex ferguson in november 2011 convinced pereira to sign for the old trafford club .
once the `` smoking gun '' transcript was made public , nixon 's political support practically vanished . the ten republicans on the house judiciary committee who had voted against impeachment in committee announced that they would now vote for impeachment once the matter reached the house floor . he lacked substantial support in the senate as well ; barry goldwater and hugh scott estimated no more than 15 senators were willing to even consider acquittal . facing certain impeachment in the house of representatives and equally certain conviction in the senate , nixon announced his resignation on the evening of thursday , august 8 , 1974 , effective as of noon the next day . although the structure was not completed until some years after the presidency of george washington , there is speculation that the name of the traditional residence of the president of the united states may have derived from martha washington 's home , white house plantation in virginia , where the nation 's first president had courted the first lady in the mid-18th century . assistant to the president became a rank generally shared by the chief of staff with such senior aides as deputy chiefs of staff , the white house counsel , the white house press secretary , and others . this new system did not catch on immediately . democrats kennedy and johnson still relied on their appointments secretaries instead , and it was not until the nixon administration that the chief of staff took over maintenance of the president 's schedule . this concentration of power in the nixon and ford white house -lrb- whose last chief of staff was dick cheney -rrb- led presidential candidate jimmy carter to campaign in 1976 with the promise that he would not appoint a chief of staff .
we have been honored by a visit from colonel boon , the first settler of kentucky ; he lately spent two weeks with us ... he left this for the river platt , some distance above . col boon is eighty-five years of age , five feet seven inches high , stoutly made , and active for one of his years ; is still of vigorous mind , and is pretty well informed . he has taken part in all the wars of america , from before braddock 's war to the present hour . many suggested dewey run for president on the democratic ticket in 1900 . his candidacy was plagued by public relations missteps . he was quoted as saying the job of president would be easy since the chief executive was merely following orders in executing the laws enacted by congress and that he would `` execute the laws of congress as faithfully as i have always executed the orders of my superiors . '' he admitted to never having voted in a presidential election . with three separate organizations in the confined waters of the lower mississippi , the fleet command situation was already bad enough , but it began to deteriorate further when the buildup of farragut 's fleet in the lower river became apparent . flag officer hollins was at this time near memphis , which represented the then-northernmost holdings of the confederacy on the river , and the confederate war department insisted that no effort should be spared to maintain possession . hollins was sure that the threat from the gulf was much more severe than richmond thought , so he was prepared to listen when general lovell pleaded for him to come down to new orleans to help in its defense . when there , he sent a telegram to richmond seeking permission to attack farragut 's ships while they were still lightened to be brought in across the bar .
one week after the high-profile meeting between president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un , americans are generally satisfied with what was accomplished in the summit between the leaders , according to a cnn poll conducted by ssrs that was released on tuesday . just over half -- 52 % -- were satisfied with how the meeting went , with 36 % saying they were dissatisfied . eighty-five percent of republicans were happy after the summit , with 52 % of independents , and 28 % of democrats saying the same . over a third say the outcome of the summit was a major achievement for the us , with 29 % saying it was minor and 27 % saying it was not an achievement at all . many americans across the us are angry with president donald trump for his `` zero tolerance '' immigration policy , which has sought to deter illegal entry by detaining and separating migrant families . critics say the policy , which was recently altered to address some concerns of separation , is not emblematic of who we are as a nation . others say it runs counter to the america they know and love . but history shows policies like this have been implemented time and time again since the nation began . six-in-10 americans would rather maintain good relationships with countries that have been close allies to the us than impose tariffs to protect us industries , according to a cnn poll conducted by ssrs . only a quarter of respondents prioritize the tariffs and protecting us industries . the question was asked after president donald trump 's imposition of tariffs on chinese goods , such as aluminum , tin , and electronic products . trump 's behavior at the g7 summit in canada earlier this month did nothing to help his standing with the american public and their view of how he 's handling foreign trade .
jews -lrb- hebrew : יְהוּדִים iso 259-2 yehudim , israeli pronunciation -rrb- or jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and a nation , originating from the israelites and hebrews of historical israel and judah . jewish ethnicity , nationhood , and religion are strongly interrelated , as judaism is the ethnic religion of the jewish people , while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance.jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the middle east during the second millennium bce , in the part of the levant known as the land of israel . the merneptah stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of israel somewhere in canaan as far back as the 13th century bce -lrb- late bronze age -rrb- . the israelites , as an outgrowth of the canaanite population , consolidated their hold with the emergence of the kingdoms of israel and judah .
on january 18 , 2006 , brown stated that certainly things could have been handled differently , such as calling in the military . as one of the largest natural disasters to ever strike the u.s. , he stated , `` it was beyond the capacity of the state and local governments , and it was beyond the capacity of fema . '' on february 10 , 2006 , brown again testified before congress , this time placing blame on the department of homeland security for the poor handling of the disaster , asserting that the anti-terrorism focus of the department had caused it to deny resources needed to properly operate fema . in his february 2006 testimony , brown also contradicted earlier claims that the white house was unaware of levees having been breached , stating : `` for them to claim that we did n't have awareness of it is just baloney . '' prior to the establishment of the u.s. department of homeland security , there existed an assistant to the president for the office of homeland security , which was created following the september 11 attacks in 2001 . hurricane katrina occurred while chertoff was secretary of homeland security . the department was criticized for its lack of preparation in advance of the well-forecast hurricane ; most criticism was directed toward the federal emergency management agency . dhs in general , and chertoff in particular , were criticized for responding poorly to the disaster , ignoring crucial information about the catastrophic nature of the storm and devoting little attention to the federal response to what became the most costly disaster in american history .
the united states of america -lrb- usa -rrb- , commonly known as the united states -lrb- u.s. or us -rrb- or america , is a country comprising 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . at 3.8 million square miles -lrb- 9.8 million km2 -rrb- , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of europe . most of the country is located in central north america between canada and mexico . with an estimated population of over 328 million , the u.s. is the third most populous country .
before the stockholm conference , ghana had felt the need for environmental protection and prepared the ground for a body to deal with environmental matters in the country . several organizations had begun initiatives in environmental work ; the best-known were : in the industrial countries , voluntary environmental agreements often provide a platform for companies to be recognized for moving beyond the minimum regulatory standards and thus support the development of the best environmental practice . for instance , in india , environment improvement trust -lrb- eit -rrb- has been working for environmental and forest protection since 1998 . a group of green volunteers gets a goal of green india clean india concept . ca gajendra kumar jain a chartered accountant , is the founder of environment improvement trust in sojat city a small village of state of rajasthan in india in developing countries , such as latin america , these agreements are more commonly used to remedy significant levels of non-compliance with mandatory regulation . the same year , the resource conservation and recovery act was passed , significantly amending the solid waste disposal act of 1965 . it tasked the epa with setting national goals for waste disposal , conserving energy and natural resources , reducing waste , and ensuring environmentally sound management of waste . accordingly , the agency developed regulations for solid and hazardous waste that were to be implemented in collaboration with states .
the drug enforcement administration was established in 1973 , combining the bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs -lrb- bndd -rrb- and customs ' drug agents . proceedings to add , delete , or change the schedule of a drug or other substance may be initiated by the dea , the department of health and human services -lrb- hhs -rrb- , or by petition from any interested party , including the manufacturer of a drug , a medical society or association , a pharmacy association , a public interest group concerned with drug abuse , a state or local government agency , or an individual citizen . when a petition is received by the dea , the agency begins its own investigation of the drug . for thirty years , the republic act no. 6425 , or the dangerous drugs act of 1972 , had been the backbone of the drug law enforcement system in the philippines . despite the efforts of various law enforcement agencies mandated to implement the law , the drug problem alarmingly escalated with orbiting police officers collecting drug money . the high profitability of the illegal drug trade , compounded by the then existing laws that imposed relatively light penalties to offenders , greatly contributed to the gravity of the problem . the drug enforcement administration was established on july 1 , 1973 , by reorganization plan no. 2 of 1973 , signed by president richard nixon on july 28 . it proposed the creation of a single federal agency to enforce the federal drug laws as well as consolidate and coordinate the government 's drug control activities . congress accepted the proposal , as they were concerned with the growing availability of drugs .
in 1867 in vevey , switzerland , henri nestlé developed milk-based baby food and soon began marketing it . the following year , daniel peter began seven years of work perfecting the milk chocolate manufacturing process . nestlé was the solution peter needed to fix his problem of removing all the water from the milk added to his chocolate , thus preventing the product from developing mildew . henri nestlé retired in 1875 but the company , under new ownership , retained his name as société farine lactée henri nestlé . rolo -lrb- pronounced / ˈrəʊləʊ / -rrb- , referring to the roll-styled candy , is a brand of truncated cone-shaped or conical frustum-shaped chocolates with a caramel middle . first manufactured in the united kingdom by mackintosh 's in 1937 -lrb- followed by rowntree 's after the takeover in 1969 -rrb- , they are made by nestlé -lrb- except in the united states , where production has been licensed to the hershey company -rrb- . a long-running british advertising slogan for the brand was `` do you love anyone enough to give them your last rolo ? '' a yougov poll saw rolo ranked the twelfth most popular and seventeenth most famous confectionary in the uk . in may 2018 , it was announced that nestlé and starbucks struck a $ 7.15 billion distribution deal , which allows nestlé to market , sell and distribute starbucks coffee globally and to incorporate the brand 's coffee varieties into nestlé 's proprietary single-serve system , expanding the overseas markets for both companies .
in the 1980s jenkins met with juan javier macklis , who owned a pharmaceutical plant in tijuana , mexico , that was contracted to supply medicines for the mexican government . together , jenkins and macklis produced anabolic steroids ; jenkins then smuggled the drugs into the united states , which is a felony . in april 1987 jenkins was arrested and pleaded guilty in december of that year for the trafficking of steroids worth around $ 100 million which was caught at the tijuana border . it was reported that at one time jenkins was responsible for up to 70 % of the steroids trafficked in the united states . according to the wall street journal , thanks to `` elaborate structure and cash flows '' , both barclays and wachovia were able to take credit for a full payment of the tax , meaning the $ 94 million could be claimed twice -lrb- a so-called `` double dip '' -rrb- . the report suggested that augustus funding was one of at least nine structures involving us banks set up by jenkins and his team . barclays called the account of the transactions `` materially inaccurate '' , while a statement from wachovia said that they had `` complied with all applicable laws and regulations '' . in 2009 , the guardian reported tales of a macho culture inside the structured capital markets division , where , one source claimed , `` the deals are so big you never say billion or million , you just say 16 bucks or 16 quid which meant billion '' . the same source suggested that tax avoidance `` was so big it became the engine of growth for the whole of the investment banking arm '' . some calculations had estimated that in 2002 jenkins and his team generated revenues amounting to more than 100 per cent of barclays capital 's profits , figures barclays said were `` gross exaggerations '' , adding that jenkins was in charge of four businesses -- tax-efficient financing being only one -- and that those businesses generated less than 20 per cent of the bank 's revenues .
within the united states armed forces , according to an unscientific survey , the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections . while 73 percent of military personnel said they would vote for bush , 18 percent preferred his democratic rival , john kerry . according to peter feaver , a duke university political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the u.s. military , members of the armed services supported bush because they found him more likely than kerry to complete the war in iraq . during the 1980s , the u.s. had provided aid to panamanian leader manuel noriega , an anti-communist dictator who engaged in drug trafficking . in may 1989 , noriega annulled the results of a democratic presidential election in which guillermo endara had been elected . bush objected to the annulment of the election and worried about the status of the panama canal with noriega still in office . bush dispatched 2,000 soldiers to the country , where they began conducting regular military exercises in violation of prior treaties . more than 20 nations -lrb- most notably the united kingdom -rrb- , designated the `` coalition of the willing '' joined the united states in invading iraq . they launched the invasion on march 20 , 2003 . the iraqi military was quickly defeated . the capital , baghdad , fell on april 9 , 2003 .
on september 21 , 1996 , clinton signed into law the defense of marriage act -lrb- doma -rrb- , which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman ; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states . paul yandura , speaking for the white house gay and lesbian liaison office , said clinton 's signing doma `` was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election '' . in defense of his actions , clinton has said that doma was intended to `` head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states '' , a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a `` very reactionary congress '' . administration spokesman richard socarides said , `` the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse , and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected . '' in april 1994 , genocide broke out in rwanda . intelligence reports indicate that clinton was aware a `` final solution to eliminate all tutsis '' was planned . fearing a reprisal of the events in somalia the previous year , clinton chose not to intervene . president clinton has referred to the failure of the u.s. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings , saying `` i do n't think we could have ended the violence , but i think we could have cut it down . on october 21 , 1994 , the clinton administration launched the first official white house website , whitehouse.gov . the site was followed with three more versions , resulting in the final edition launched in 2000 . the white house website was part of a wider movement of the clinton administration toward web-based communication . according to robert longley , `` clinton and gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies , the u.s. court system and the u.s. military onto the internet , thus opening up america 's government to more of america 's citizens than ever before .
afghan traditions would need a generation or more to overcome and could only be challenged by education , he said . humayun tandar , who took part as an afghan diplomat in the 2001 international conference on afghanistan in bonn , said that `` strictures of language , ethnicity , region were stifling for massoud . that is why ... he wanted to create a unity which could surpass the situation in which we found ourselves and still find ourselves to this day . '' this applied also to strictures of religion . in early 2001 , massoud and several other afghan leaders addressed the european parliament in brussels , asking the international community to provide humanitarian help . the afghan envoy asserted that the taliban and al-qaeda had introduced `` a very wrong perception of islam '' and that without the support of pakistan and osama bin laden , the taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for another year . massoud warned that his intelligence had gathered information about an imminent , large-scale attack on us soil . on 6 december , us officials indicated that they have not ruled out talks with the taliban . several days later it was reported that gates saw potential for reconciliation with the taliban , but not with al-qaeda . furthermore , he said that reconciliation would politically end the insurgency and the war . but he said reconciliation must be on the afghan government 's terms , and that the taliban must be subject to the sovereignty of the government .
aa 's program extends beyond abstaining from alcohol . its goal is to effect enough change in the alcoholic 's thinking `` to bring about recovery from alcoholism '' through `` an entire psychic change , '' or spiritual awakening . a spiritual awakening is meant to be achieved by taking the twelve steps , and sobriety is furthered by volunteering for aa and regular aa meeting attendance or contact with aa members . members are encouraged to find an experienced fellow alcoholic , called a sponsor , to help them understand and follow the aa program . in 1981 , twitty was exiting his tour bus when he slipped on the steps and fell , hitting his head against the steps . john hughey , who was twitty 's steel guitar player , found him on the ground . many people , including family members , said that twitty underwent a change in personality after the accident . according to his daughter joni , twitty was not in a right state of mind for several months , saying in an interview that he had picked up a tv remote and began talking into it , thinking it was a phone . `` thirteenth-stepping '' is a pejorative term for aa members approaching new members for dates . a study in the journal of addiction nursing sampled 55 women in aa and found that 35 % of these women had experienced a `` pass '' and 29 % had felt seduced at least once in aa settings . this has also happened with new male members who received guidance from older female aa members , in pursuit of sexual company . the authors suggest that both men and women need to be prepared for this behavior or find male-only or female-only groups .
applicants who are found , through investigation or personal admission , to have experimented with or used narcotics or dangerous drugs , except those medically prescribed , will not be considered for employment with the drug enforcement administration -lrb- dea -rrb- . exceptions to this policy may be made for applicants who admit to limited youthful and experimental use of marijuana . such applicants may be considered for employment if there is no evidence of regular , confirmed usage and the full-field background investigation and results of the other steps in the process are otherwise favorable . hen it comes to a drug that is currently listed in schedule i , if it is undisputed that such drug has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the united states and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision , and it is further undisputed that the drug has at least some potential for abuse sufficient to warrant control under the csa , the drug must remain in schedule i . in such circumstances , placement of the drug in schedules ii through v would conflict with the csa since such drug would not meet the criterion of `` a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the united states . '' 21 usc 812 -lrb- b -rrb- . -lrb- emphasis added -rrb- the dea has been criticized for placing highly restrictive schedules on a few drugs which researchers in the fields of pharmacology and medicine regard as having medical uses . critics assert that some such decisions are motivated primarily by political factors stemming from the u.s. government 's war on drugs , and that many benefits of such substances remain unrecognized due to the difficulty of conducting scientific research . a counterpoint to that criticism is that under the controlled substances act it is the department of health and human services -lrb- through the food and drug administration and the national institute on drug abuse -rrb- , not the dea , which has the legal responsibility to make scientific and medical determinations with respect to drug scheduling ; no drug can be scheduled if the secretary of health and human services recommends against it on a scientific or medical basis , and no drug can be placed in the most restrictive schedule -lrb- schedule i -rrb- if dhhs finds that the drug has an accepted medical use . jon gettman 's essay science and the end of marijuana prohibition describes the dea as `` a fall guy to deflect responsibility from the key decision-makers '' and opines , `` hhs calls the shots when it comes to marijuana prohibition , and the cops at dea and the general over at ondcp take the heat .

nevada -lrb- or -rrb- is a state in the western united states . it is bordered by oregon to the northwest , idaho to the northeast , california to the west , arizona to the southeast , and utah to the east . nevada is the 7th most extensive , the 32nd most populous , and the 9th least densely populated of the u.s. states . nearly three-quarters of nevada 's people live in clark county , which contains the las vegas -- paradise metropolitan area , including three of the state 's four largest incorporated cities .
pope paul vi left the vatican to go to the papal summer residence , castel gandolfo , on 14 july 1978 , visiting on the way the tomb of cardinal giuseppe pizzardo , who had introduced him to the vatican half a century earlier . although he was sick , he agreed to see the new italian president sandro pertini for over two hours . in the evening he watched a western on tv , happy only when he saw `` horses , the most beautiful animals that god had created . '' he had breathing problems and needed oxygen . falasca noted the 2009 testimony of sister margherita marin -lrb- b. 1941 -rrb- , one of the two sisters who found the pope dead in his bedroom on the morning of 29 september . john paul i had made it a practice to have a morning coffee in the sacristy and then go into the chapel to pray before tending to the day 's matters . sister vincenza had noted the pope had not touched the coffee she had left for him in the sacristy at 5:15 am -lrb- after about ten minutes -rrb- and went looking for him but found him dead , and hastily summoned marin who also went into the room . pope paul vi died on 6 august 1978 , ending a reign of fifteen years . luciani had gone to the late pope 's funeral and mingled with the crowds who wanted to view the body of the late pope . in a certain moment , he thought he would not reach the body . but finally he was recognised once he had arrived and was then led to another place and was offered a bench to kneel and pray .
article one of the united states constitution -lrb- section ii -rrb- directs the population be enumerated at least once every ten years and the resulting counts used to set the number of members from each state in the house of representatives and , by extension , in the electoral college . the census bureau now conducts a full population count every 10 years in years ending with a zero and uses the term `` decennial '' to describe the operation . between censuses , the census bureau makes population estimates and projections . by law , the census bureau must count everyone and submit state population totals to the u.s. president by december 31 of any year ending in a zero . states within the union receive the results in the spring of the following year . the census bureau estimates that in 1970 over six percent of african americans went uncounted , whereas only around two percent of european americans went uncounted . democrats often argue that modern sampling techniques should be used so that more accurate and complete data can be inferred . republicans often argue against such sampling techniques , stating the u.s. constitution requires an `` actual enumeration '' for apportionment of house seats , and that political appointees would be tempted to manipulate the sampling formulas .
with about 200 retail spaces and two separate food courts : the dine-o-rama and the lake county fare food court , gurnee mills was intended from the beginning as a state-of-the-art mall , with high-tech features like a television studio where mall-specific commercials could be produced and shown on the mall 's 55 monitors , and its 15 ft -lrb- 4.6 m -rrb- `` video wall '' . the family entertainment center featured a video arcade and other attractions for children . these features were intended to help turn the mall into a center for entertainment , not just for shopping , as the mills corporation felt entertainment was the future for shopping malls . one marketing study found gurnee mills was so large that many shoppers preferred to drive to the other side of the parking lot rather than walk to the other end of the mall . summit place mall was michigan 's first enclosed shopping mall . it was built at the northwest corner of telegraph road -lrb- us 24 -rrb- and elizabeth lake road on the boundary between the city of pontiac and waterford township . two tenants opened ahead of the mall : a kroger supermarket began operation in 1961 , and a montgomery ward department store in february 1962 . opening on thursday , may 10 , 1962 , the mall featured one other major department store : a `` budget '' branch of detroit-based hudson 's , which unlike the existing hudson 's stores , did not feature furniture or small appliances . neiman marcus opened a clearance center in 2009 . meanwhile , gurnee mills announced in 2011 that it would demolish the vacant former circuit city location entirely and construct an entirely new building for a macy 's department store at one end of the building , and remodel an area between kohl 's and value city furniture to create a `` full price wing . '' the mall promised that these new developments would turn it into the `` first true hybrid center '' and change its `` personality . '' the new stores opened on july 24 , 2013 in time for the mall 's 22nd anniversary , with the promise of other retailers following macy 's path , and `` positioning gurnee mills for another 20 years of relevance '' .
aol was one of the early pioneers of the internet in the mid-1990s , and the most recognized brand on the web in the united states . it originally provided a dial-up service to millions of americans , as well as providing a web portal , e-mail , instant messaging and later a web browser following its purchase of netscape . in 2001 , at the height of its popularity , it purchased the media conglomerate time warner in the largest merger in u.s. history . aol rapidly declined thereafter , partly due to the decline of dial-up and rise of broadband . time for kids is a division magazine of time that is especially published for children and is mainly distributed in classrooms . tfk contains some national news , a `` cartoon of the week '' , and a variety of articles concerning popular culture . an annual issue concerning the environment is distributed near the end of the u.s. school term . the publication rarely exceeds ten pages front and back . according to aol president and coo bob pittman , the slow-moving time warner would now take off at internet speed , accelerated by aol : `` all you need to do is put a catalyst to , and in a short period , you can alter the growth rate . the growth rate will be like an internet company . '' the vision for time warner 's future seemed clear and straightforward ; by tapping into aol , time warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers . aol would use time warner 's high-speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers time warner 's branded magazines , books , music , and movies .
after making the saga albums with alex campbell and johnny silvo , denny looked for a band that would allow her to stretch herself as a vocalist , reach a wider audience , and have the opportunity to display her songwriting . she said , `` i wanted to do something more with my voice . '' after working briefly with the strawbs , denny remained unconvinced that they could provide that opportunity , and so she ended her relationship with the band . this dour man is nonetheless remembered for at least one example of his wit . also in his memoir , recounting his failure in 1853 to reach agreement with david swinson `` doc '' maynard over what was intended to be a joint plat of the town of seattle , he wrote , `` it was found that the doctor , who occasionally stimulated a little , had that day taken enough to cause him to feel that he was not only monarch of all he surveyed , but what boren and i had surveyed as well . '' john low and david denny headed north to scout the possibilities . along the way they were joined by leander `` lee '' terry . in newly founded olympia , washington , they met michael simmons , the wealthy founder of tumwater . he guided them to alki as a possible site for a settlement .
they started swarming across america 's border , millions of desperate families fleeing poverty or seeking political asylum . but many people were repelled by their presence . some warned that the country was facing a `` genetic invasion '' and that whites were `` losing the demographic game . '' another said , `` there will no longer be an america for americans . '' the number of voters who said that the president is a factor in their vote for congress this year is the highest it 's been for any midterm election since pew began tracking the question in 1982 during ronald reagan 's first term . six in 10 registered voters said president donald trump is a factor in a pew research center poll taken in september , including 37 % who said they 'll cast a ballot to oppose the president and 23 % who 'll be voting to support him . just 37 % said trump is n't a factor in their vote for congress . the number of people who are using their vote to oppose trump is higher than most previous elections where the question was asked , only behind president george w. bush in early october 2006 , when 39 % of registered voters said they would use their vote against him , 18 % wanted their vote to support the president and 40 % did n't factor him in . democratic sen. kamala harris , a potential 2020 presidential candidate , proposed new legislation on thursday aiming to provide tax breaks for low - and middle-class americans . the new bill would give tax credits of up to $ 6,000 per year for households earning less than $ 100,000 annually , which comes out to $ 500 per month . individuals earning under $ 50,000 per year would be eligible for tax credits up to $ 3,000 under the plan . harris ' bill aims to offset the rising cost of living throughout the country , but with republicans in control of both chambers of congress , the proposal has very slim chances of advancing on capitol hill .
the ranch has been speculated to be haunted , as claimed by some visitors to the ranch . tim harrison , the ranch 's marketing director and events manager , said in 2016 , `` we were the hub of wagon trains that came through and people camped here and a lot of people died on the way . we believe those spirits still exist and are concentrated in our opera house -- that 's where they gather and most of the energy is felt . '' he later said in 2017 , `` there 's a little girl by the school house , several apparitions at the opera house . as mentioned , additional sequences and songs from the original off-broadway show were dropped or re-written in order for the feature version to be paced well . the notable change was for the `` meek shall inherit '' sequence . as originally filmed , it detailed through a dream sequence seymour 's rising success and the need to keep the plant fed and impress audrey . in the final cut , the dream sequence and much of the song is cut out . `` loser like me '' was given positive reviews by critics . lauren hoffman from vulture said that the episode was `` filed by emotion '' and that it was `` funny , smart , extremely meta , and genuinely touching at time '' . christopher rogers from hollywood life said that he `` totally loved the season six premiere and feel that glee 's going to go out with a bang '' . the a.v.

the plane was tending to pull right , and slowly oscillated vertically in a phugoid cycle -- characteristic of planes in which control surface command is lost . with each iteration of the cycle , the aircraft lost approximately 1,500 feet -lrb- 460 m -rrb- of altitude . on learning that fitch , an experienced united airlines captain and dc-10 flight instructor , was among the passengers , the crew called him into the cockpit for assistance . the flight was scheduled to depart at 08:00 for los angeles . fifty-one passengers and the five hijackers boarded the 767 through terminal c 's gate 19 . the plane pushed back at 07:58 and took off at 08:14 from runway 9 , about the same time flight 11 was hijacked . by 08:33 , the aircraft reached cruising altitude of 31,000 feet , which is the point when cabin service would normally begin . at 08:52 , peter hanson called his father , lee hanson , in easton , connecticut , telling him of the hijacking . hanson was traveling with his wife , sue , and their 2 1/2 - year-old daughter , christine . the family was originally seated in row 19 , in seats c , d , and e ; however , peter placed the call to his father from seat 30e . speaking softly , hanson said that the hijackers had commandeered the cockpit , that a flight attendant had been stabbed , and that possibly someone else in the front of the aircraft had been killed .
a federal judge ruled on wednesday that the terrorist screening database violates the constitutional rights of american citizens who are on it , deciding in favor of 23 citizens who sued after being placed on the watchlist . the ruling from judge anthony trenga in the eastern district of virginia calls into question federal authorities ' practice of using the list to support decisions on people 's ability to travel . while wednesday 's ruling is significant , trenga set up a bigger battle in the weeks ahead . the judge ordered both sides of the case to come up with arguments for what should happen next following his decision and those arguments could influence the fate of the database and the federal government 's process . it 's been 18 years since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the day that never ends . events in new york city , washington , d.c. , and pennsylvania -- each of which saw destruction and disaster that day -- will be held on wednesday to remember the victims and first responders . nearly 3,000 people died when hijackers took control of four commercial airplanes and crashed them into the world trade center buildings , the pentagon , and a field in shanksville , pennsylvania . more have died since from illnesses related to the destruction . pope francis , who has tussled with the american president , american capitalists and american catholics during his six years as pope , seems unfazed by the disputes . in fact , he may even enjoy them . in a brief exchange with a french journalist aboard the papal plane to africa on wednesday , francis said he was honored by criticisms from conservative catholics in the united states . `` for me it is an honor that americans attack me , '' he told nicolas senèze of catholic media outlet la croix , who has written a new book called `` how america wants to change popes .

the jet propulsion laboratory -lrb- jpl -rrb- is a federally funded research and development center and nasa field center in la cañada flintridge , california , united states , though it is often referred to as residing in pasadena , california because it has a pasadena zip code . founded in the 1930s , jpl is currently owned by nasa and managed by the nearby california institute of technology -lrb- caltech -rrb- for nasa . the laboratory 's primary function is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft , though it also conducts earth-orbit and astronomy missions . it is also responsible for operating nasa 's deep space network . on 26 november 2011 , nasa 's mars science laboratory mission was successfully launched for mars . the mission successfully landed the robotic curiosity rover on the surface of mars in august 2012 . the rover is currently helping to determine whether mars could ever have supported life , and search for evidence of past or present life on mars . after leaving r.p.i kobie took a career at nasa in their jet propulsion laboratory , working on trips from mars to planet earth . kobie boykins is a senior mechanical engineer at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california . boykins has now been working at nasa for 22 years and enjoys working in the laboratory as of 1996 . he worked with his team to design the solar array systems for the mars exploration rovers spirit and opportunity , and designed the actuators on the mars rover curiosity , the name of both wings .
all katherine mcmillan wanted in a shoe was style and comfort without the frilly bows or flowers . she 's a working mother who tends to buy men 's shirts in small sizes and prefers the kinds of casual shoes made for men -- desert boots , moccasins , chukkas . she 'll take a pair of shoes or a jacket in olive green or navy blue over lavender or aqua any day . `` i think a lot of my friends would agree that we do n't want to look like an easter egg when we go out , '' said mcmillan , who lives in minneapolis , minnesota . minneapolis -lrb- -lrb- listen -rrb- -rrb- is the county seat of hennepin county and the larger of the twin cities , the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the united states . as of 2018 , minneapolis is the largest city in the state of minnesota and 46th-largest in the united states , with an estimated population of 425,403 . the twin cities metropolitan area consists of minneapolis , its neighbor saint paul and suburbs which altogether contain about 3.63 million people , and is the third-largest economic and population center in the midwest.minneapolis lies on both banks of the mississippi river , just north of the river 's confluence with the minnesota river , and adjoins saint paul , the state 's capital . the city is abundantly rich in water , with 13 lakes , wetlands , the mississippi river , creeks and waterfalls ; many connected by parkways in the chain of lakes and the grand rounds national scenic byway . boston -lrb- uk : , us : -rrb- is the capital and most populous city of the commonwealth of massachusetts in the united states , and the 21st most populous city in the united states . the city proper covers 49 square miles -lrb- 127 km2 -rrb- with an estimated population of 694,583 in 2018 , also making it the most populous city in new england . boston is the seat of suffolk county as well , although the county government was disbanded on july 1 , 1999 . the city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as greater boston , a metropolitan statistical area -lrb- msa -rrb- home to a census-estimated 4.8 million people in 2016 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country .
once mitchell was out of dartmoor , the krays held him at a friend 's flat in barking road , east ham . he was a large man with a mental disorder , and he was difficult to control . he disappeared , but the krays were acquitted of his murder . freddie foreman , a friend of the krays , claimed in his autobiography respect that he shot mitchell dead as a favour to the twins and disposed of his body at sea . the krays ' criminal activities remained hidden behind both their celebrity status and seemingly legitimate businesses . reggie was allegedly encouraged by his brother in october 1967 , four months after the suicide of his wife , frances , to kill jack `` the hat '' mcvitie , a minor member of the kray gang who had failed to fulfil a £ 1000 contract , £ 500 of which had been paid to him in advance , to kill their financial advisor , leslie payne . mcvitie was lured to a basement flat in evering road , stoke newington on the pretence of a party . upon entering the premises , he saw ronnie kray seated in the front room . bradley was selected by the green bay packers with the 239th overall pick in the seventh round of the 2018 nfl draft . this made bradley only the ninth long snapper ever drafted in the nfl draft . the packers originally acquired the pick used to select bradley by trading lerentee mccray to the buffalo bills . on may 4 , 2018 , he signed a contract with the packers .
throughout glenn 's career , she was his traveling companion and provided behind-the-scenes administrative help that enabled seaborg to pursue many side projects , including extensive publishing efforts . seaborg credited his ability to compile so many accomplishments to her valuable advice and assistance . as the wife of the chancellor of u.c. berkeley she took on many formal duties related to protocol and dealing with official university guests . candler 's first marriage was in 1901 to helen magill , daughter of the late col. john h. magill , former editor of the hartwell , georgia sun and laura eberhardt magill . helen was `` a leading figure in local social and civic circles '' in atlanta both before and during her marriage active in the united daughters of the confederacy , the fine arts club , the atlanta woman 's club , and the atlanta garden club . helen was frequently lauded in the local press for her elegant `` toilets '' , a term used at the time for dresses or gowns . helen died in january 1927 , aged 40 . duffield moved to norwood , colorado , where she served on the board of the uncompahgre medical clinic . she died of natural causes at her home there on july 21 , 2009 . she was survived by her daughters deborah and libby . her husband robert died in 2000 .
native americans , also known as american indians , indigenous americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the united states , except hawaii and territories of the united states . more than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the us , about half of which are associated with indian reservations . the term `` american indian '' excludes native hawaiians and some alaskan natives , while `` native americans '' -lrb- as defined by the us census -rrb- are american indians , plus alaska natives of all ethnicities . the us census does not include native hawaiians or chamorro , instead being included in the census grouping of `` native hawaiian and other pacific islander '' . american ancestry refers to people in the united states who self-identify their ancestral origin or descent as `` american '' , rather than the more common officially recognized racial and ethnic groups that make up the bulk of the american people . the majority of these respondents are visibly white americans , who either simply use this response as a political statement or no longer self-identify with their original ethnic ancestral origins . the latter response is attributed to a multitude of or generational distance from ancestral lineages , and these tend be of english , scotch-irish , or other british ancestries , as demographers have observed that those ancestries tend to be seriously undercounted in u.s. census bureau american community survey ancestry self-reporting estimates . although u.s. census data indicates `` american ancestry '' is commonly self-reported in the deep south and upland south , the vast majority of americans and expatriates do not equate their nationality with ancestry , race or ethnicity , but with citizenship and allegiance . the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical , geographical , and political context in which it is used . american is derived from america , a term originally denoting all of the new world -lrb- also called the americas -rrb- . in some expressions , it retains this pan-american sense , but its usage has evolved over time and , for various historical reasons , the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america . in modern english , american generally refers to persons or things related to the united states of america ; among native english speakers this usage is almost universal , with any other use of the term requiring specification .
while on a trip to los angeles , lenz landed her first professional job in a commercial for dolls from the teen drama series swans crossing . lenz eventually went on to appear in commercials for eggo waffles , dr pepper and others . she continued to find work steadily as an actress , and by her sophomore year in high school she landed the role of linda halleck in stephen king 's thinner . she appeared in various pilots , commercials and films , and performed regional theatre until she was eventually cast as a series regular on guiding light . in 2012 , lenz decided to concentrate on projects that were `` strategically designed to move her career in a direction that was not quite the same thing as she was doing on one tree hill '' . in september 2012 , it was confirmed that lenz would guest star on an episode of men at work . she played the role of meg , a single mother who the character tyler begins to date . she said the first few days were hard because she had not done comedy for some time . at the age of seventeen , lenz played the teenage clone of reva shayne on the cbs daytime soap opera guiding light for nine episodes . her stint earned her such favorable reviews from viewers , critics and guiding light executives alike that lenz was eventually recast as michelle bauer santos upon rebecca budig 's exit -- an unusual move that was `` unheard of '' in the industry according to cbs producer , mickey dwyer-dobbin . in 1999 , while working on guiding light , she graduated from eastern christian high school in new jersey and landed the role of rose cronin in mary and rhoda , a made-for-television movie that reunited mary tyler moore and valerie harper as mary richards and rhoda morgenstern . at the time lenz juggled a heavy storyline , a television movie portraying mary tyler moore 's daughter , a one-year run of a new york cabaret called foxy ladies love/boogie 70 's explosion , and the lead role in an independent film .
coltrane called this a time when `` a wider area of listening opened up for me . there were many things that people like hawk , and ben and tab smith were doing in the '40s that i did n't understand , but that i felt emotionally . '' a significant influence , according to tenor saxophonist odean pope , was the philadelphia pianist , composer , and theorist hasaan ibn ali . `` hasaan was the clue to ... the system that trane uses . according to drummer rashied ali , coltrane had an interest in the drums . he would often have a spare drum set on concert stages that he would play . his interest in the drums and his penchant for having solos with the drums resonated on tracks such as `` pursuance '' and `` the drum thing '' from a love supreme and crescent , respectively . it resulted in the album interstellar space with ali . bruce left strip city in late 1954 and found work within the san fernando valley at a variety of strip clubs . as the master of ceremonies , he introduced the strippers while performing his own ever-evolving material . the clubs of the valley provided the perfect environment for bruce to create new routines : according to his primary biographer , albert goldman , it was `` precisely at the moment when he sank to the bottom of the barrel and started working the places that were the lowest of the low '' that he suddenly broke free of `` all the restraints and inhibitions and disabilities that formerly had kept him just mediocre and began to blow with a spontaneous freedom and resourcefulness that resembled the style and inspiration of his new friends and admirers , the jazz musicians of the modernist school .

`` it 's going to be a jarring change of pace for my life , not being on the road most of the year . making songs with the band and then performing them in front of the best fans has been a once in a lifetime experience . i would n't trade the perspective i 've found in the past few years for anything . i got to meet so many amazing people and see a good chunk of the world . while he was living with maynard , salinger continued to write in a disciplined fashion , a few hours every morning . according to maynard , by 1972 he had completed two new novels . in a rare 1974 interview with the new york times , he explained : `` there is a marvelous peace in not publishing ... i like to write . in her room , kim tells tam that he should be happy because he now has a father . she tells him that she can not go with him but will be watching over him -lrb- `` this is the hour '' , referred to as `` little god of my heart '' on the 2014 london revival recording , though those words are not contained in the lyrics -rrb- . chris , ellen , john , and the engineer arrive just outside her room . the engineer comes in to take tam outside to introduce tam to his father .
the report is published by the cea in february of each year . it reviews what economic activity was of impact in the previous year , outlines the economic goals for the coming year -lrb- based on the president 's economic agenda -rrb- , and makes numerical projections of how the economy will perform . criticism usually follows , sometimes attacking the importance placed or not placed on particular data , and also on the importance of particular goals presented in the overview . actual data , related to or used in the report , are from the bureau of economic analysis and u.s. bureau of labor statistics . americans have racked up billions -- yes , billions -- of dollars worth of overdraft charges . in 2016 , u.s. consumers paid a total of $ 15 billion in fees for bouncing checks or overdrafting -- which is when a customer tries to make a purchase without enough money in their account to cover the transaction -- according to new data released by the consumer financial protection bureau . all banks with assets over $ 1 billion must report how much money it brought in via bounced check and overdraft fees , according to cfpb . and this year the industry rang up at $ 11.41 billion . foxconn 's pledge to invest $ 10 billion to build a factory in wisconsin that will create between 3,000 and 13,000 new jobs has been met with plenty of excitement . but there 's a catch : part of the deal is $ 3 billion in state incentives that have been promised by governor scott walker but must be still be approved by the wisconsin legislature . and the price tag on that package has some people spooked . `` when you take the number of jobs that are created , this is so over the top , '' said paul soglin , the democratic mayor of madison , at a news conference last week .
pearle vision is an american chain of eye care stores . it was founded in 1961 by stanley pearle , an optometrist in savannah , georgia , united states . in 1971 , pearle purchased a 17-store optical chain owned by robert hillman and larry kohan ; together , hillman and kohan stayed on and helped to expand pearle vision nationwide.in the 1970 's the chain was owned by gd searle pharmaceutical , not stanley pearle who was a founding father and board member > stanley pearle sold his stores to the united kingdom conglomerate grand metropolitan in 1985 . grand met expanded pearle vision to more than 1,000 locations worldwide by 1990 , but profits became elusive . the company listed in new york in 1990 , and in milan in december 2000 , joining the mib-30 -lrb- now ftse mib -rrb- index in september 2003 . the listing raised money for the company and allowed it to use its shares to acquire other brands , starting with italian brand vogue eyewear in 1990 , persol and the united states shoe corporation -lrb- lenscrafters -rrb- in 1995 , ray-ban in 1999 and sunglass hut , inc. in 2001 . luxottica later increased its presence in the retail sector by acquiring sydney-based opsm in 2003 , pearle vision and cole national in 2004 . luxottica acquired oakley in november 2007 for us$ 2.1 billion . notably , pearle vision has repeatedly experienced difficulty operating successfully in california . its traditional business model directly conflicts with california 's strong consumer protection statutes which are designed to prevent the obvious conflict of interest that arises when an optometrist and an optician practice side-by-side in the same business -lrb- one can prescribe more eyewear to be made by the other , thus inflating the overall profits of the business -rrb- . on june 12 , 2006 , the supreme court of california ruled that pearle vision could not escape the reach of those statutes , and pearle vision 's attempts to find a loophole through the knox-keene health care service plan act of 1975 were unavailing .
the apostolic palace -lrb- latin : palatium apostolicum ; italian : palazzo apostolico -rrb- is the official residence of the pope , the head of the catholic church , located in vatican city . it is also known as the papal palace , the palace of the vatican and the vatican palace . the vatican itself refers to the building as the palace of sixtus v , in honor of pope sixtus v , who built most of the present form of the palace . the building contains the papal apartments , various offices of the catholic church and the holy see , private and public chapels , vatican museums , and the vatican library , including the sistine chapel , raphael rooms , and borgia apartment . for most of this time the popes did not live at the vatican . the lateran palace , on the opposite side of rome , was their habitual residence for about a thousand years . from 1309 to 1377 , they lived at avignon in france . on their return to rome they chose to live at the vatican . on 26 march 2013 , the vatican announced that pope francis would not move into the papal apartment in the apostolic palace . he is the first pope not to live in the papal apartments on the third floor of the apostolic palace since pope pius x occupied them in 1903 . he uses the palace suite there as his office . he remained for a time in the room he was assigned by lot at the start of the conclave that elected him and then moved to suite 201 of domus sanctae marthae .
the passage originally appeared in the dialogue held with a certain persian , the worthy mouterizes , in anakara of galatia written in 1391 as an expression of the views of the byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus , one of the last christian rulers before the fall of constantinople to the muslim ottoman empire , on such issues as forced conversion , holy war , and the relationship between faith and reason . according to the german text , the pope 's original comment was that the emperor `` addresses his interlocutor in an astoundingly harsh -- to us surprisingly harsh -- way '' -lrb- wendet er sich in erstaunlich schroffer , uns überraschend schroffer form -rrb- . pope benedict apologised for any offence he had caused and made a point of visiting turkey , a predominantly muslim country , and praying in its blue mosque . benedict planned on 5 march 2008 , to meet with muslim scholars and religious leaders autumn 2008 at a catholic-muslim seminar in rome . later visiting the country to `` reiterate the solidarity between the cultures , '' it was reported that he made a counter-statement backing turkey 's bid to join the eu . prime minister of turkey recep tayyip erdoğan , said that the pope told him in their meeting that while the vatican seeks to stay out of politics it desires turkey 's membership in the eu . however , the common declaration of pope benedict xvi and patriarch bartholomew i of constantinople implied that support for turkey 's membership in the european union would be contingent on the establishment of religious freedom in turkey : `` in every step towards unification , minorities must be protected , with their cultural traditions and the distinguishing features of their religion . '' the declaration also reiterates pope benedict xvi 's call for europe to preserve its christian roots . benedict xv made valiant efforts to end world war i . in 2005 , pope benedict xvi recognized the significance of his long-ago predecessor 's commitment to peace by taking the same name upon his own rise to the pontificate . benedict xv 's humane approach to the world in 1914 -- 1918 starkly contrasted with that of the monarchs and leaders of the time . his worth is reflected in the tribute engraved at the foot of the statue that the turks , a non-catholic , non-christian people , erected of him in istanbul : `` the great pope of the world tragedy , ... the benefactor of all people , irrespective of nationality or religion .

melania trump stepped onto center stage monday for the highest-profile speech of her life , but the moment was quickly overshadowed by controversy after it emerged that portions of the speech were plagiarized from michelle obama 's 2008 address to the democratic national convention . melania trump initially appeared to deliver the speech her husband needed to portray him in a softer light . she offered testimony about the character of her husband , donald trump , and said he would never let america down . the former fashion model , who rarely takes a leading role on the campaign trail , was the star attraction on the first night of the republican national convention . ted cruz stole the show , and then donald trump stole it right back . the long , divisive primary of 2016 played out in one final , spectacular episode on live television wednesday night on the floor of the republican national convention . here are seven takeaways from the penultimate night in cleveland -- setting up a final note of drama when trump takes the stage : cruz 's 2020 gamble ted cruz placed a bet wednesday night that could define his political life . it was a remarkable scene : the texas senator took the stage and congratulated trump for winning the republican nomination . take two . the second night of the republican national convention was a chance to get past the messiness of day 1 , which began with a floor fight over rules and ended with allegations of plagiarism by melania trump . tuesday 's theme was `` make america work again , '' and the republican national committee and trump 's campaign were tasked with showing how trump will get america working again , and to present a unified party showcase . so , how did they do ?
in 2000 , the u.s. promotion was halted after fraud was uncovered . a subcontracting company , simon marketing -lrb- a then-subsidiary of cyrk -rrb- , that had been hired by mcdonald 's to organize and promote the game , failed to recognize a flaw in its procedures . chief of security jerome p. jacobson was able to remove the most valuable game pieces , which he then passed to associates who would redeem them and share the proceeds . according to jacobson , his disloyalty began when executives began re-running randomized draws to ensure high-level prizes went to areas in the united states rather than canada . `` people always ask questions about where the name the onion came from '' , said former president sean mills in an interview with wikinews ; `` and , when i recently asked -lrb- co-founder -rrb- tim keck , who was one of the founders , he told me ... literally that his uncle said he should call it the onion when he saw him and chris johnson eating an onion sandwich . they had literally just cut up the onion and put it on bread . '' according to former editorial manager , chet clem , their food budget was so low when they started the paper that they were down to white bread and onions . this account was disputed by an editor of the onion , cole bolton , during an event at the university of chicago . in january 1999 , when jon stewart became the host of the daily show he tapped former onion writer/editor karlin to be head writer of the newly restructured show . `` he had heard about this group of onion people in l.a. and , in a weird way , i was the de facto ringleader of our group in l.a. i came to new york . jon and i connected .

the death of brent taylor -- the north ogden , utah , mayor and soldier who was killed saturday in afghanistan -- reverberated far beyond his small city in northern utah . people around the country are mourning the loss of the national guardsman who was finishing up his latest tour of duty in the war-torn country when he was killed in a so-called `` insider '' attack . but despite the grief , many are finding hope in the final message taylor posted to facebook , just days before he died . `` as the usa gets ready to vote in our own election -lrb- tuesday -rrb- , i hope everyone back home exercises their precious right to vote , '' taylor wrote in the post . early voting continues to be explosive , as an energized american electorate weighs in on its government . as of early tuesday morning , at least 33 million people have voted early nationwide , according to data collected by catalist , a data company that works with democrats and others , to compile counts of ballots cast before election day , either early in-person or by mail . that 's far more than the 22 million early votes cast in the entire 2014 election . the data suggests an electorate deeply engaged in voters ' first real opportunity to offer a verdict on the presidency of donald trump , who has actively tried to turn the election into a referendum on himself . a native american tribe is suing to stop north dakota 's new voter identification law before the midterm election vote next week , saying that the law disenfranchises voters living on reservations . the complaint centers around a state voter id law that requires voters to provide a form of identification that includes their legal name , current street address and date of birth . the plaintiffs say the street address requirement poses a unique challenge to native americans who live on reservations or in rural areas , as the street names and residential addressees there have been assigned in incomplete or inconsistent ways . the federally-recognized spirit lake tribe filed a complaint tuesday against north dakota secretary of state alvin jaeger that reads : `` jaeger 's implementation of the residential address requirement has imposed severe -- sometimes insurmountable -- burdens on the right to vote for many voters on reservations .

the emergence of the new organizational strategies can be seen in the politics of connecticut around 1806 , which have been well documented by cunningham . the federalists dominated connecticut , so the republicans had to work harder to win . in 1806 , the state leadership sent town leaders instructions for the forthcoming elections . every town manager was told by state leaders `` to appoint a district manager in each district or section of his town , obtaining from each an assurance that he will faithfully do his duty '' . the democratic national committee -lrb- dnc -rrb- is responsible for promoting democratic campaign activities . while the dnc is responsible for overseeing the process of writing the democratic platform , the dnc is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public policy . in presidential elections , it supervises the democratic national convention . the national convention is subject to the charter of the party and the ultimate authority within the democratic party when it is in session , with the dnc running the party 's organization at other times . in august 2018 , democratic party officials and television networks began discussions as to the nature and scheduling of the following year 's debates and the nomination process . changes were made to the role of superdelegates , deciding to allow them to vote on the first ballot only if the nomination is uncontested . the democratic national committee -lrb- dnc -rrb- announced the preliminary schedule for the 12 official dnc-sanctioned debates , set to begin in june 2019 , with six debates in 2019 and the remaining six during the first four months of 2020 .

sen. cory booker has promised to run a relentlessly positive and unifying campaign , preaching love as an antidote to the nation 's ills during his first trip to iowa as a presidential candidate this weekend . it 's a message that sets him apart in a large and growing democratic field : booker is n't the only candidate talking about bringing a polarized nation together , but some of his rivals have tried to channel their party 's anger at president donald trump . whether democratic voters think a candidate wrapped in a message of love has the mettle to beat trump might be one the fundamental questions around booker 's campaign . as booker conceded himself following his campaign launch , `` love ai n't easy . '' there 's no indication that americans like howard schultz two weeks into the rollout of his possible independent run for president ; he had the worst numbers of any potential candidate tested , only one-in-five said they were likely to support him if he were to run in 2020 , according to a cnn poll conducted by ssrs and released wednesday . schultz falls behind ohio sen. sherrod brown -lrb- 21 % likely to support -rrb- , new york sen. kirsten gillibrand -lrb- 22 % -rrb- , and the other billionaire businessman thinking about running -- former new york city mayor michael bloomberg -lrb- 27 % -rrb- , who built a media company that bears his name and now might run for president as a democrat . schultz was tied with bloomberg for those who said they were `` not likely at all '' to support the two candidates . they follow the more than half of americans who said they were `` not likely at all '' to support president donald trump , according to the poll . this weekend was a busy one on the 2020 campaign trail , with two more democrats -- amy klobuchar and elizabeth warren -- joining the race officially . there are now seven main democrats running for the party nod , with at least twice that number either officially or unofficially exploring a bid . with so many candidates getting in the race , it 's worth looking at who did it best . -lrb- nota bene : campaign announcements do n't make or break a campaign .

holmes explained that one of the goals for halo 4 's campaign was to incorporate more human elements into the story . to accomplish this the team wrote a b story that explored master chief 's relationship with his ai partner , cortana , who would break down into a dementia-like state . the development team realized that halo 4 's narrative could be dense and hard to approach , making it inaccessible for new players . they found incorporating such a storyline into an action game to be extremely challenging and considered dropping it during development . 1up.com reviewer jose otero was critical of halo 4 's story , writing that the ending of the game `` does n't make a lot of sense '' . he also remarked that while the narrative tied the main plot lines together well , it was disappointing to see some of the smaller story points were ignored entirely . both g4 and official xbox magazine agreed that the plot became convoluted on occasions and might be difficult to understand for new players of the franchise . g4 reviewer , adam rosenburg , also stated that while the soundtrack had some memorable moments , he was disappointed that composer neil davidge had chosen to ditch the familiar theme of previous games . on october 18 , 2012 , the halo 4 launch trailer , titled `` scanned '' , premiered on late night with jimmy fallon . the trailer was produced by david fincher and directed by tim miller . the trailer was filmed in prague and features both cgi and live action sequences . it shows master chief , bound by a force shield , being approached by an enemy .
southern liberals were an essential part of the new deal coalition -- without them roosevelt lacked majorities in congress . typical leaders were lyndon b. johnson in texas , jim folsom and john sparkman in alabama , claude pepper in florida , earl long in louisiana , luther h. hodges in north carolina , and estes kefauver in tennessee . they promoted subsidies for small farmers , and supported the nascent labor union movement . an essential condition for this north-south coalition was for northern liberals to ignore southern racism . the south has produced various nationally known politicians and political movements . in 1948 , a group of democratic congressmen , led by governor strom thurmond of south carolina , split from the democrats in reaction to an anti-segregation speech given by minneapolis mayor and future senator hubert humphrey of minnesota . they founded the states rights democratic or dixiecrat party . during that year 's presidential election , the party ran thurmond as its candidate and he carried four deep south states . i do solemnly swear -lrb- or affirm -rrb- that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect , and defend the constitution of the united states .

during his army service , hayden was stripped of his birth name and was given the name palmer hayden instead by a commanding sergeant during world war i . the justification behind this abrupt decision is speculated but ultimately unknown , and two popular theories have emerged within the community of art historian ; one theory is employed in bearden and henderson 's book a history of african american artists : 1792 to the present , in which the story follows hayden asking for a letter of reference from his previous job but having his name mistakenly written as palmer hayden instead of peyton hedgeman . unwilling to ask for another letter that correctly identified him , he took the letter and adopted the name palmer hayden as he transitioned into the army . the alternate theory is stated in driskell 's harlem renaissance : art of black america , where it is claimed his commanding sergeant mispronounced his real name , giving him the name palmer hayden instead . it was also during sharrock 's absence that wolfgang noticed a teenage boy hunting crabs . later , he claimed to have seen the same boy twice more , once in the company of his sister and sharrock and again sometime much later walking alone . there has been doubt about his description of this person , as wolfgang 's testimony over time variously suggested he had a homemade speargun , a fishing knife , or both . the last official sighting of schmidt and sharrock was around 12:45 by local fireman dennis dostine , who was walking in the area with his son and saw the girls walking about 730 metres -lrb- 2,400 ft -rrb- north of the surf club . as an adolescent , hayden relocated to washington , d.c. in order to find work , where he became a porter and an errand boy . the subject of his sketches shifted to objects and activities he witnessed daily , such as sailboats and fishermen . it was in washington , d.c. where hayden ultimately began to pursue an art career , and where he first encountered an experience with explicit racism . hayden had placed an ad in the local paper for an artist 's assistant , and was bewildered when he was rejected for being african-american upon arriving at the interview .

his heart was in hanover ... he was more than fifty years of age when he came amongst us : we took him because we wanted him , because he served our turn ; we laughed at his uncouth german ways , and sneered at him . he took our loyalty for what it was worth ; laid hands on what money he could ; kept us assuredly from popery ... i , for one , would have been on his side in those days . on june 29 , 2019 , snyder accepted a soon-to-be controversial appointment at harvard to share his knowledge of state and local government . on july 3 , he tweeted that he was `` turning down '' the offer : `` it would have been exciting to share my experiences , both positive and negative ; our current political environment and its lack of civility makes this too disruptive . i wish them the best . '' writing in forbes magazine , monte burke states that distaste for snyder has made the team name controversy worse than it needed to be , but there are others that also defend his position .
this is an extraordinary achievement . landing a rover on mars is not easy -- others have tried -- only america has fully succeeded . the investment we are making ... the knowledge we hope to gain from our observation and analysis of gale crater , will tell us much about the possibility of life on mars as well as the past and future possibilities for our own planet . curiosity will bring benefits to earth and inspire a new generation of scientists and explorers , as it prepares the way for a human mission in the not too distant future . the beagle 2 team made a virtue out of necessity ; it was known that there was no chance of obtaining funds in europe , at that time , of the scale previously considered necessary for a mars rover , so the team used innovative methods to reduce the cost to less than 4 % of the cost of the curiosity mission . it was considered a large risk , and although beagle 2 did successfully survive its entry , descent , and landing , incomplete deployment of the solar panels hampered communication back to earth . the team has proposed that a future launch might take multiple low-cost beagle-type landers , with a realistic expectation that the vast majority would be successful , allowing exploration of several locations on mars and possibly asteroids , all for considerably less cost than a single `` normal '' rover expedition . after leaving r.p.i kobie took a career at nasa in their jet propulsion laboratory , working on trips from mars to planet earth . kobie boykins is a senior mechanical engineer at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california . boykins has now been working at nasa for 22 years and enjoys working in the laboratory as of 1996 . he worked with his team to design the solar array systems for the mars exploration rovers spirit and opportunity , and designed the actuators on the mars rover curiosity , the name of both wings .
as part of a career analysis , indiewire 's oliver lyttelton notes that early in his career , cooper was typecast as `` weaselly boyfriends or best friends in mainstream comedies '' , but he later became one of hollywood 's most accomplished actors after starring in several successful films . cooper is known for appearing in a range of films ; writing for the hollywood reporter , bill phelps credits him for `` opt for the challenging and provocative , the small and interesting , risking the laid-back image that propelled him to fame . '' the daily beast 's oliver lyttelton agrees , remarking : `` cooper ... regularly ventures outside his grinning-stud comfort zone by taking on roles that , on the surface , might not necessarily seem like perfect matches . '' time magazine writes of cooper 's craft : `` it 's hard to make people , especially your friends , forget who you are onscreen . on july 27 , 2017 bradley stated he would announce his retirement . in a statement , referring to his fight against ruslan provodnikov , he said , `` a few weeks after the fight , i was still affected by the damage that was done . my speech was a little bit off . i was slurring a little bit . unlike some of the more colorful generals of world war ii , bradley was polite and courteous in his public appearances . a reticent man , bradley was first favorably brought to public attention by war correspondent ernie pyle , who was urged by general eisenhower to `` go and discover bradley '' . pyle subsequently wrote several dispatches in which he referred to bradley as the gi 's general , a title that would stay with bradley throughout his remaining career . will lang jr. of life magazine said `` the thing i most admire about omar bradley is his gentleness .
vanderbilt university -lrb- informally vandy or vu -rrb- is a private research university in nashville , tennessee . founded in 1873 , it was named in honor of new york shipping and rail magnate cornelius vanderbilt , who provided the school its initial $ 1-million endowment despite having never been to the south . vanderbilt hoped that his gift and the greater work of the university would help to heal the sectional wounds inflicted by the civil war . vanderbilt is one of only two power 5 schools that do not sponsor women 's volleyball , the other one being oklahoma state . in addition , vanderbilt is the only school in the sec that does not sponsor softball . as one of the richest americans in history and wealthiest figures overall , vanderbilt was the patriarch of the wealthy and influential vanderbilt family . he provided the initial gift to found vanderbilt university in nashville , tennessee . according to historian h. roger grant : `` contemporaries , too , often hated or feared vanderbilt or at least considered him an unmannered brute . while vanderbilt could be a rascal , combative and cunning , he was much more a builder than a wrecker being honorable , shrewd , and hard-working .

rocket appeared sometimes with his friend dan gosch as superheroes `` captain packard '' and his faithful sidekick `` lobo '' . in an risd yearbook , the duo appeared in a photo at the rhode island state house with then-governor frank licht . rocket made several short films and fronted his band , the fabulous motels , on accordion -lrb- which he used in an snl sketch about a crazed criminal who uses an accordion to kill his dates and is killed himself by a bagpipe band -rrb- . he later anchored the local news at channel 12 wpri-tv and at koaa-tv in pueblo , colorado under his own name , and wtvf nashville under the name charles kennedy . head coach tom landry once said : `` doug dennison is the best guy i know to give a football to on the goal line or short yardage , '' `` if you want to make it , you give it to doug . dennison is going to give you everything he 's got .

the whcd has been increasingly criticized as an example of the coziness between the white house press corps and the administration . the dinner has typically included a skit , either live or videotaped , by the sitting u.s. president in which he mocks himself , for the amusement of the press corps . the press corps , in turn , hobnobs with administration officials , even those who are unpopular and are not regularly cooperative with the press . increasing scrutiny by bloggers has contributed to added public focus on this friendliness . the white house released the subpoenaed tapes on august 5 . one tape , later known as the `` smoking gun '' tape , documented the initial stages of the watergate coverup . on it , nixon and h. r. haldeman are heard formulating a plan to block investigations by having the cia falsely claim to the fbi that national security was involved . this demonstrated both that nixon had been told of the white house connection to the watergate burglaries soon after they took place , and that he had approved plans to thwart the investigation . the white house on tuesday officially corrected the record on an insulting remark president donald trump uttered a day earlier in the rose garden . an official transcript distributed on monday evening showed the president telling a female senior correspondent she was n't `` thanking '' when he called on her , an odd construction that bore little resemblance to what the president is heard on video saying . in fact , the president told reporter cecilia vega she was n't `` thinking '' -- words reflected in a corrected transcript the white house distributed on tuesday morning . calling on vega during a free-wheeling news conference , the president quipped that abc 's senior white house correspondent was `` shocked that i picked her .

in spite of this hardline rhetoric , however , goulding called a ceasefire just six weeks later , on 29 may 1972 . one of the more surprising tributes to mccann came from gusty spence , leader of the ulster volunteer force loyalist group . spence wrote a letter of sympathy to mccann 's widow , expressing his , `` deepest and profoundest sympathy '' on the death of her husband . `` he was a soldier of the republic and i a volunteer of ulster and we made no apology for being what we were or are ... joe once did me a good turn indirectly and i never forgot him for his humanity '' . mccann was again named on the bench for the second match against bulgaria but opted out of the squad two hours prior to kick-off claiming it was a waste of his time being there . don givens criticised mccann saying , `` i can never understand anybody that does n't want to pull on the green shirt '' . he also added that this event could hinder mccann 's future international career , `` will i pick him again ? would you ? '' . mccann 's third album , 2001 's complete , was issued on warner bros. . records , due to the closure of asylum records 's nashville division which resulted in the transfer of asylum 's roster to the warner bros. label . nineteen years old at the time of its release , mccann felt that the album marked an increased level of maturity in her work . the first single from complete , `` come a little closer '' , reached a peak of no. 43 on the country music charts .
wichita -lrb- witch-i-taw -rrb- is the largest city in the u.s. state of kansas and the county seat of sedgwick county . as of 2018 , the estimated population of the city was 389,255 . wichita is the principal city of the wichita metropolitan area which had an estimated population of 644,888 in 2018 . located in south-central kansas on the arkansas river , wichita began as a trading post on the chisholm trail in the 1860s and was incorporated as a city in 1870 . it became a destination for cattle drives traveling north from texas to kansas railroads , earning it the nickname `` cowtown . in the northern-hemisphere summer of 1940 germany rapidly defeated the french third republic , and colonial administration of french indochina -lrb- modern-day vietnam , laos and cambodia -rrb- passed to the french state -lrb- vichy france -rrb- . in september 1940 japanese troops first entered parts of indochina ; and in july 1941 japan extended its control over the whole of french indochina . the united states , concerned by japanese expansion , started putting embargoes on exports of steel and oil to japan from july 1940 . the desire to escape these embargoes and to become self-sufficient in resources ultimately contributed to japan 's decision to attack on december 7 , 1941 the british empire -lrb- in hong kong and malaya -rrb- and simultaneously the usa -lrb- in the philippines -rrb- and at pearl harbor , hawaii -rrb- .
several historians and commentators hold that bush was one of the most consequential presidents in american history . princeton university scholar julian zelizer described bush 's presidency as a `` transformative '' one , and said that `` some people hate him , some people love him , but i do think he 'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on '' . bryon williams of the huffington post referred to bush as `` the most noteworthy president since fdr '' and said the patriot act `` increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable '' as evidence . bush 's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the presidency of ronald reagan , and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the great society . a 2010 siena research institute survey of the opinions of historians , political scientists , and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents . the survey respondents gave president bush low ratings on his handling of the u.s. economy , communication , ability to compromise , foreign policy accomplishments , and intelligence . bush said in 2013 , `` ultimately history will judge the decisions i made , and i wo n't be around because it will take time for the objective historians to show up . so i am pretty comfortable with it . polls of historians and political scientists have ranked bush in the top half of presidents . a 2018 poll of the american political science association 's presidents and executive politics section ranked bush as the 17th best president out of 44 . a 2017 c-span poll of historians also ranked bush as the 20th best president out of 43 . richard rose described bush as a `` guardian '' president , and many other historians and political scientists have similarly described bush as a passive , hands-off president who was `` largely content with things as they were '' .

in 1910 , mary phelps jacob -lrb- known later in life as caresse crosby -rrb- , a 19-year-old new york socialite , purchased a sheer evening gown for a debutante ball . at that time , the only acceptable undergarment was a corset stiffened with whalebone . mary had large breasts and found that the whalebone visibly poked out around her plunging neckline and from under the sheer fabric . dissatisfied with this arrangement , she worked with her maid to fashion two silk handkerchiefs together with some pink ribbon and cord . however , the area was in some turmoil at the time with considerable tensions between the christian , jewish and muslim populations . burton did his best to keep the peace and resolve the situation , but this sometimes led him into trouble . on one occasion , he claims to have escaped an attack by hundreds of armed horsemen and camel riders sent by mohammed rashid pasha , the governor of syria . he wrote , `` i have never been so flattered in my life than to think it would take three hundred men to kill me .

the united nations trusteeship council , one of the principal organs of the united nations , was established to ensure that trust territories were administered in the best interests of their inhabitants and of international peace and security . the trust territories -- most of them are former mandates of the league of nations or territories taken from nations defeated at the end of world war ii -- have all now attained self-government or independence , either as separate nations or by joining neighbouring independent countries . the last was palau , formerly part of the trust territory of the pacific islands , which became a member state of the united nations in december 1994 . staffan de mistura -- who has been the united nations ' top emissary in iraq , afghanistan and other once-volatile locales -- is moving on to syria , in the hope of turning the tide after years of war there . u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon announced thursday that de mistura will take on role as the world body 's official facilitator on syria . that position as the u.n. 's syria envoy was formerly held by lakhdar brahimi and , before that , former secretary-general kofi annan . despite considerable , high-level efforts , neither managed to halt a conflict that -- according to the united nations -- has left more than 150,00 dead and some 680,000 injured since it began in march 2011 . in october 2011 city and state officials announced an agreement in which the un would be allowed to build a long-sought new office tower just south of the existing campus on the current robert moses playground , which would be relocated . in exchange , the united nations would allow the construction of an esplanade along the east river that would complete the east river greenway , a waterfront pedestrian and bicycle pathway . while host nation authorities have agreed to the provisions of the plan , it needs the approval of the united nations in order to be implemented . the plan is similar in concept to an earlier proposal that had been announced in 2000 but did not move forward .

through hours of outbursts and objections in military court , eddie bracken said he had one image in his mind : that of a plane smashing into the world trade center tower where his sister worked . anger surged inside him , bracken told reporters sunday , a day after he sat among a group of victim family members who watched the arraignment of accused 9/11 mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed and four others at guantanamo bay , the u.s. naval base where the men are being tried before a military court . `` just listening to that rhetoric , how they perceive themselves -- it 's hurtful , because they have no remorse . i do n't think they even have any souls , '' he said . senator arlen specter said the court should `` decide more cases '' . on the other hand , although justice scalia acknowledged in a 2009 interview that the number of cases that the court hears now is smaller today than when he first joined the supreme court , he also stated that he has not changed his standards for deciding whether to review a case , nor does he believe his colleagues have changed their standards . he attributed the high volume of cases in the late 1980s , at least in part , to an earlier flurry of new federal legislation that was making its way through the courts . when asked about the kind of justices he would appoint to the supreme court , president bill clinton insisted that he had no litmus test for his justice , but at the same time , that he only wanted justices who would be pro-choice when it came to abortion . `` i will appoint judges to the supreme court who believe in the constitutional right to privacy , including the right to choose '' , clinton said in an interview on april 5 , 1992 . in an interview on june 18 , 1992 , clinton said , `` i do n't believe in the litmus test for supreme court judges , but i do think that the court has been so politicized by the recent appointments under the last two presidents that we ought to appoint someone who can provide some balance ; someone who everybody will say , ` there is someone who can be a great judge and someone who believes in the constitution , the bill of rights and protecting the rights of ordinary citizens to be let alone from undue intrusion by their government . ' '' in addition , clinton said he felt it was unhealthy that the court was dominated by former judges , most of whom , he felt , lacked adequate real-world experience .

in another interview romano jokingly responded about the kissing thing that roberts did off-camera : `` you know how great she was then ! '' he also added : `` we had a little get together for her . she was one of a kind . she can outwork it , outdrink it , good kisser , i was joking ! the associated press reported that `` ater , as the two men shook hands in the capitol , roberts appeared to say the mistake was his fault . '' the following evening in the white house map room with reporters present , roberts and obama repeated the oath correctly . this was , according to the white house , done out of `` an abundance of caution '' to ensure that the constitutional requirement had been met . in private meetings with senators before his confirmation , roberts testified that roe was settled law , but added that it was subject to the legal principle of stare decisis , meaning that while the court must give some weight to the precedent , it was not legally bound to uphold it .

over the years colorado state university has had a few different mascots . in 1919 there was a black bear cub that served as the mascot not much was known about the cub . it was unknown where the bear came from or even its name , just as he mysteriously appeared , he disappeared the same year . he was replaced by peanuts the bulldog in 1912 . a few years after left right tim was founded , camden johnson , a member of lrt , saw the need for an organization to cater to beginners and comedy novices who were interested in improv . he founded the umbrella improv initiative , or the `` umbrella academy '' , which selected student coaches to teach a new team of 10 to 12 improvisers based on the upright citizens brigade 's style of improv . over the course of a 12-week semester the group was given a crash course in short form and long form improve comedy , culminating with a debut show at the end of the term in hale 270 . since its founding in 2011 , umbrella has graduated over a dozen `` generations '' of improvisers , and the organization continues to grow , with gen 17 set to begin in the fall of 2019 . by 1892 , the last two years of classes were taught in denver because the larger population afforded more practical experience . this triggered a turf battle with the private medical school at the university of denver , and the resulting legal battle went all the way to the supreme court of colorado . in 1897 , the supreme court found that the charter of the university of colorado restricted it to teaching in boulder .

there are currently three living retired justices of the supreme court of the united states : sandra day o'connor , anthony kennedy , and david souter . as retired justices , they no longer participate in the work of the supreme court , but may be designated for temporary assignments to sit on lower federal courts , usually the united states courts of appeals . such assignments are formally made by the chief justice , on request of the chief judge of the lower court and with the consent of the retired justice . in recent years , justice o'connor has sat with several courts of appeals around the country , and justice souter has frequently sat on the first circuit , the court of which he was briefly a member before joining the supreme court . while the justices of the supreme court are appointed for life , many have retired or resigned . beginning in the early 20th century , many justices who left the court voluntarily did so by retiring from the court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether . a retired justice , according to the united states code , is no longer a member of the supreme court , but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a u.s. court of appeals or district court , and many retired justices have served in these capacities . historically , the average length of service on the court has been less than 15 years . established by article iii of the constitution , the composition and procedures of the supreme court were initially established by the 1st congress through the judiciary act of 1789 . as later set by the judiciary act of 1869 , the court consists of the chief justice of the united states and eight associate justices . each justice has lifetime tenure , meaning they remain on the court until they resign , retire , die , or are removed from office . when a vacancy occurs , the president , with the advice and consent of the senate , appoints a new justice .
there are so many other things he could do with his life . hank gathers had the same thing , hank could have been a comedian , and actor or did speaking engagements . it 's not worth the risk . i would just say absolutely not , do n't do it . hudson was first approached by ronnie hawkins and levon helm in the summer of 1961 , after a kapers show in london , and asked to join the hawks , an offer he declined . the hawks persisted , and in december of 1961 , hudson agreed to join the band on two conditions : that hawkins buy him a lowrey organ , and that he be paid and extra $ 10 a week to give music lessons to the other hawks . this second condition was in part to justify the move to his parents , who he feared would think he was squandering his years of music education by playing in a rock and roll band . discussing the thinking behind his early fears in the last waltz , hudson told interviewer-director martin scorsese : `` there is a view that jazz is ` evil ' because it comes from evil people , but actually the greatest priests on 52nd street and on the streets of new york city were the musicians . the film is based on sully 's autobiography highest duty , rights to which were optioned by producers frank marshall and allyn stewart in 2010 . they developed the screenplay with stewart 's partner executive producer kipp nelson , hiring screenwriter todd komarnicki . from the start , sullenberger wanted the film to encompass `` that sense of our common humanity '' , noting that the incident had taken place shortly after the 2008 great recession . he explains : `` people were wondering if everything was about self-interest and greed .
three former cia directors -- george tenet , porter goss and michael v. hayden -- as well as three former cia deputy directors , wrote an op-ed in the wall street journal in response to the release of the senate intelligence committee report . they criticized the report as `` a partisan attack on the agency that has done the most to protect america after the 9/11 attacks . '' they said that the cia 's interrogation program was invaluable to the capture of al qaeda operatives and the disruption of al qaeda 's efforts and also stated that , contrary to the senate intelligence committee 's findings , `` there is no doubt that information provided by the totality of detainees in cia custody was essential to bringing bin laden to justice . '' additionally , they wrote that the cia remained within the interrogation techniques authorized by the doj ; that the cia did not mislead the doj , white house or congress ; and that the threat of a '' ` ticking time bomb ' scenario '' context was critical to understanding the program . the george w. bush administration consolidated many of these activities under the united states department of homeland security -lrb- dhs -rrb- , a new cabinet department established as a result of the homeland security act of 2002 . however , much of the nation 's homeland security activity remains outside of dhs ; for example , the fbi and cia are not part of the department , and other executive departments such as the department of defense and united states department of health and human services and they play a significant role in certain aspects of homeland security . homeland security is coordinated at the white house by the adviser to the president for national security and the adviser to the president for terrorism and homeland security . the staff of the national security council manages policy integration of national security and homeland security . in a september 7 , 2007 , public address to the council on foreign relations in new york , rare for a sitting director of central intelligence , general michael hayden praised the program of detaining and interrogating prisoners , and credited it with providing 70 percent of the national intelligence estimate on the threat to america released in july . hayden said the cia has detained fewer than 100 people at secret facilities abroad since 2002 , and even fewer prisoners have been secretly transferred to or from foreign governments . in a 20-minute question-and-answer session with the audience , hayden disputed assertions that the cia has used waterboarding , stress positions , hypothermia and dogs to interrogate suspects -- all techniques that have been broadly criticized . `` that 's a pretty good example of taking something to the darkest corner of the room and not reflective of what my agency does '' hayden told one person from a human rights organization .
president donald trump took the unusual step friday of adding names to the roster of potential supreme court justices he distributed during his run for office , even though the court has no current vacancies and no justices have announced their intentions to retire . the names supplement a list trump released during last year 's presidential campaign of conservative jurists whom he would consider nominating to the high court should a vacancy arise . trump nominated one of those judges , neil gorsuch , earlier this year to replace the late justice antonin scalia . when trump originally released his list last year , the court was short a justice . there are currently three living retired justices of the supreme court of the united states : sandra day o'connor , anthony kennedy , and david souter . as retired justices , they no longer participate in the work of the supreme court , but may be designated for temporary assignments to sit on lower federal courts , usually the united states courts of appeals . such assignments are formally made by the chief justice , on request of the chief judge of the lower court and with the consent of the retired justice . in recent years , justice o'connor has sat with several courts of appeals around the country , and justice souter has frequently sat on the first circuit , the court of which he was briefly a member before joining the supreme court . according to the judicial common space scores , a score based on the ideology scores of the home state senators and the president who nominated the judge to the federal bench , clarence thomas is the only justice more conservative than kavanaugh . according to this metric , kavanaugh 's confirmation would mean the composition of the court would shift to the right . had merrick garland been confirmed , stephen breyer would have become the median swing vote when justice kennedy retired . however , since scalia was replaced by another conservative -lrb- gorsuch -rrb- , it was expected that chief justice john roberts would become the median swing vote on the supreme court upon kavanaugh 's confirmation .
the first congress of the party convened in baghdad in 1946 , thanks to barzani 's initiative in the aftermath of the republic of mahabad indeed , the peculiar circumstances of the kurdish people necessitated the existence of a patriotic , nationalist and democratic party capable of leading the movement of the kurds . at this congress , the party 's statute was formulated and barzani was elected the first president of the party . this congress convened in naw pirdan on july 1 , 1970 almost four months after march 11 agreement with the objective of enhancing the ranks of the party , the people of kurdistan and that of iraqi people as whole . this congress is considered to be a very important one with regard to organisation , maximum attendance by party members , guests , friends of the party and the kurdish people as well as realisation of the congressional objectives . jalal talabani -lrb- arabic : جلال طالباني jalāl ṭālabānī ; 1933 -- 3 october 2017 -rrb- was an iraqi kurdish politician who served as the sixth president of iraq from 2006 to 2014 , as well as the president of the governing council of iraq . he was the first non-arab president of iraq . he is known as mam jalal -lrb- uncle jalal -rrb- in the middle east . the surname talabani means ` scholar ' in native kurdish .
weiss defended iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad against accusations of anti-semitism . in march 2006 , during an earlier visit to iran , weiss released a statement to iran 's official irib radio in which he stated that : `` it is dangerous deviation to pretend that the iranian president is anti-jewish and anti-semitic . he is extremely friendly and he understands the difference between the zionists and the jews who do not embrace the state of israel . '' the statement added that they were `` upset about the recent ploys , propaganda and tensions which have been created by the west regarding the statements of the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad about a world free of zionism , since this is nothing more than wishing for a better world dominated by peace and calm . '' ronald s. lauder , president of the world jewish congress , complained to the united nations and the italian government about ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference , stating that `` it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference . '' iranian ambassador to the european union ali ahani called the response in europe `` unrealistic and premature , '' complaining about the discriminatory treatment of the international community , which iran feels has continued to ignore the threats of israel and its `` organized campaign to provoke others into attacking iran 's facilities and infrastructure '' , referring to israel 's support of an american attack on iran . hassan hanizadeh , an editorialist for the tehran times , claimed that the criticism of ahmadinejad 's statement by the united states and other western countries is an attempt to divert attention from `` the ever-increasing crimes the zionists are committing against the innocent palestinians . ''

''
seeking to weaken hussein 's grip on power , clinton signed the iraq liberation act of 1998 into law on october 31 , 1998 , which instituted a policy of `` regime change '' against iraq , though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of american military forces . the administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named operation desert fox , lasting from december 16 to 19 , 1998 . at the end of this operation clinton announced that `` so long as saddam remains in power , he will remain a threat to his people , his region , and the world . with our allies , we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program , while working toward the day iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors . '' clinton strongly supported the 2001 u.s. military action in afghanistan , saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of afghan women who suffered under the taliban government . clinton voted in favor of the october 2002 iraq war resolution , which authorized president george w. bush to use military force against iraq . in may 2006 , a cnn poll comparing clinton 's job performance with that of his successor , george w. bush , found that a strong majority of respondents said clinton outperformed bush in six different areas questioned . gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that clinton was regarded by 13 percent of americans as the greatest president in u.s. history .
citing the court 's practices following the death of justice robert h. jackson in 1954 , tom goldstein of scotusblog suggested in february 2016 that the court was more likely to set evenly-divided cases for reargument after a new justice is appointed to the court . however , the court split 4 -- 4 in at least five cases of the 2015 term : for cases that were not decided before his death , justice scalia 's votes were not counted , with the cases decided by the remaining eight members of the court . when the court issues any ruling with votes split 4 -- 4 , the court does not publish a written opinion with respect to the merits of the case and the ruling of the lower court is affirmed , although the court 's affirmance has no effect as precedent in future cases . a cert petition is voted on at a session of the court called a conference . a conference is a private meeting of the nine justices by themselves ; the public and the justices ' clerks are excluded . the rule of four permits four of the nine justices to grant a writ of certiorari . if it is granted , the case proceeds to the briefing stage ; otherwise , the case ends .
i 'd like somebody to mention that day that martin luther king jr. tried to give his life serving others . i 'd like for somebody to say that day that martin luther king jr. tried to love somebody . martin luther king iii was born on october 23 , 1957 , to civil rights advocates martin luther king jr. and coretta scott king . his mother had reservations about naming him after his famous father , `` realizing the burdens it can create for the child , '' but king jr. always wanted to name his son martin luther iii . king 's birth occurred as his father was speaking to members of the southern christian leadership conference , and he announced his son 's name after being told of the birth . king 's birth caused much of his mother 's time to be taken away from her artistry and she spent the remainder of his birth year caring for him and his older sister yolanda . on the other hand , king 's son , martin luther king iii , was quoted as being pleased with the sternness of the depiction , saying that `` well if my father was not confrontational , given what he was facing at the time , what else could he be ?

`` troubling and counterproductive '' rhetoric from north korea is inflaming tensions on the korean peninsula , but ultimately , `` we will judge north korea by its actions , not its words , '' the u.s. envoy to north korea said friday . in its latest bout of saber-rattling , north korea on friday warned of the possibility of `` strong physical counter-measures '' against south korea after the united nations imposed tougher sanctions against the north earlier this week . the threat against south korea came a day after the north said it would carry out a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches as part of a new phase of confrontation with the united states . the statement friday from north korea 's committee for peaceful reunification of the fatherland said it would take action against south korea if it `` takes a direct part '' in the u.n. sanctions . north korea -lrb- korean : 조선 ; mr : chosŏn or literally 북조선 ; mr : pukchosŏn -rrb- , officially the democratic people 's republic of korea -lrb- dprk or dpr korea ; korean : 조선민주주의인민공화국 , chosŏn minjujuŭi inmin konghwaguk -rrb- , is a country in east asia constituting the northern part of the korean peninsula , with pyongyang as its capital and the largest city in the country . to the north and northwest , the country is bordered by china and by russia along the amnok -lrb- known as the yalu in chinese -rrb- and tumen rivers , and to the south , it is bordered by south korea , with the heavily fortified korean demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- separating the two . nevertheless , north korea , like its southern counterpart , claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands . in 1910 , korea was annexed by imperial japan . the united nations security council unanimously adopted on tuesday a resolution condemning north korea 's recent rocket launch and expanding existing u.n. sanctions . `` this resolution demonstrates to north korea that there are unanimous and significant consequences for its flagrant violation of its obligations under previous resolutions , '' the u.s. ambassador to the united nations , susan rice , told reporters after the vote . read more : huge crowds gather in north korean capital to celebrate rocket launch `` more importantly , the provisions of this resolution -- both new sanctions and the tightening and expanding of existing measures -- concretely help to impede the growth of north korea 's -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- program and reduce the threat of proliferation by targeting entities and individuals directly involved in these programs , '' she said . specifically , the resolution imposes sanctions on a handful of north korean companies , a bank and its space agency .

according to a study released in 2017 by researchers from the university of pittsburgh , the link between sleep disturbance and the use of social media was clear . it concluded that blue light had a part to play -- and how often they logged on , rather than time spent on social media sites , was a higher predictor of disturbed sleep , suggesting `` an obsessive ` checking ' '' . the strong relationship of social media use and sleep disturbance has significant clinical ramifications for a young adults health and well-being . in a recent study , we have learned that people in the highest quartile for social media use per week report the most sleep disturbance . the idea that social media are defined simply by their ability to bring people together has been seen as too broad , as this would suggest that fundamentally different technologies like the telegraph and telephone are also social media . the terminology is unclear , with some early researchers referring to social media as social networks or social networking services in the mid 2000s . a more recent paper from 2015 reviewed the prominent literature in the area and identified four common features unique to then-current social media services : social media as a news source is the use on online social media platforms to obtain news . just as television turned a nation of people who listened to media content into watchers of media content in the 1950s to the 1980s , the emergence of social media has created a nation of media content creators . according to 2011 pew research data , nearly 80 % of american adults are online and nearly 60 % of them use social networking sites . according to the pew research center , which is an internet research company , 62 % of adults in the united states get the news from social media .

n.j. gov. chris christie 's speech to the republican national convention proved he might have made a good vice presidential pick for donald trump , especially when it comes to the traditional vice presidential role of savaging the opposition . christie tore into hillary clinton with gusto on tuesday night , leading the assembled delegates in a mock prosecution of clinton for the `` crimes '' of pursuing foreign policies that failed to bring peace to the middle east , stop the rise of isis , contain aggressive russian president vladimir putin or topple the dictatorial castro regime in cuba . christie then proceeded to criticize clinton 's diplomatic efforts in libya , nigeria , syria , russia and cuba , arguing in each case that she was too soft on dictators and terrorists . chris christie riled up the crowd tuesday night during a blistering attack against hillary clinton at the republican national convention . it was n't quite the role he was hoping to play this week . the new jersey governor , who was unsuccessful in his own 2016 white house bid , was on donald trump 's shortlist to become his running mate , just within grasp of making it onto the presidential ticket after all . instead , he watched indiana gov. donald trump claimed the mantle tuesday as the republican presidential nominee , capping a stunning rise to power for his insurgent campaign as a boisterous showing by his family and friends revived his convention after a rocky start . chris christie , shaking off the disappointment of being passed over as trump 's running mate , performed a show trial of hillary clinton , whipping the crowd into frenzied chants of `` lock her up ! lock her up ! '' trump 's son , donald jr. , marked himself as a rising political star , sketching a portrait of his father as a champion of the working man who could unleash america 's potential .

on july 26 , 2018 , john schnatter filed a lawsuit against papa john 's pizza to give him access to the company 's books and records after they fired him from the company after the teleconference call scandal . he describes the company 's procedures as an `` unexplained and heavy-handed way '' to cut ties between him and the company that he founded . in addition to preventing him from accessing information , the corporation has also implemented a poison pill strategy in order to limit schnatter 's chances of buying back a majority stake in the company . in october 2017 , in a conference call with investors , schnatter blamed the national football league for poor financial performance , stating `` the nfl has hurt us ... we are disappointed the nfl and its leadership did not resolve this '' , referring to the u.s. national anthem protests by football players . papa john 's pizza had a marketing agreement to be the `` official pizza company '' of the nfl and also had marketing deals with 23 of its 32 individual teams , and schnatter said the protests were hurting the company 's sales of pizzas . later that day , papa john 's announced that the nfl shield or `` official sponsor '' designation on papa john 's commercials and advertising would be removed . the papa john 's restaurant was founded in 1984 when `` papa '' john schnatter knocked out a broom closet in the back of his father 's tavern , mick 's lounge , in jeffersonville , indiana . he then sold his 1971 camaro z28 to purchase us$ 1,600 worth of used pizza equipment and began selling pizzas to the tavern 's customers out of the converted closet . his pizzas proved sufficiently popular that a year later he moved into an adjoining space . dipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by papa john 's pizza that same year , and has since become popular when eating pizza , especially the crust .

the emblems was immensely popular with the common people , but the critics of the 17th and 18th centuries had no mercy on quarles . sir john suckling in his sessions of the poets disrespectfully alluded to him as he `` that makes god speak so big in 's poetry .

adam green came into chillerama with the title of this short already established , but he was encouraged to make it his own . green 's first decision , given the delicate nature of the subject matter , was that the story had to be over-the-top and would have to `` make a clown out of hitler '' to ensure no one would deem it offensive . his second decision was casting joel moore in that role . `` if joel moore is hitler , '' green said , `` there is absolutely no way you can take this seriously for a second .

porter was previously married to matthew hoffman , with whom she has three children . porter said during her campaign that her marriage was marked by physical and mental abuse . according to porter , her husband punched her , shoved her one-year-old daughter across the kitchen , threatened to kill himself , and hurled profane insults at her family . the couple divorced in 2013 , and porter is now a single mother with custody of their children . the writers initially planned for the series ' seventh and eighth seasons to comprise a two-season arc , but current events surrounding the u.s. government convinced them to instead continue the arc from season 6 into season 7 . showrunner alex gansa said `` given the swirl of news about the administration 's war with its own intelligence community , `` it was just hard not to do it . it was hard to say ` ok , let 's go tell a story in paris . let 's go tell a story in south america .

the ever-growing book of weird handshakes involving president donald trump has a new chapter ! on thursday in brussels -- ahead of a nato summit -- trump and newly-elected french president emmanuel macron sat down for a talk and a handshake . and what a handshake it was ! watch ! when president roosevelt won the presidency in 1932 , he chose early to be his secretary responsible for handling the press , or as the role was becoming known , `` the press secretary . '' after accepting the job , early laid out for roosevelt his vision of how the role should be conducted . he requested having unfettered access to the president , having his quotes and statements directly attributable to him as press secretary , and offering as much factual information to the press as it became available . he also convinced roosevelt to agree to twice-weekly presidential press conferences , with the timing of each tailored to the different deadline schedules of the white house press corps . at 11:54 a.m. , associate justice clarence thomas swore in mike pence as the 48th vice president of the united states , with pence 's hand on his personal bible as well as the bible of ronald reagan , the politician who inspired pence to join the republican party . a performance of `` america the beautiful '' by the mormon tabernacle choir followed . at noon , trump became the 45th president of the united states , taking the oath of office with chief justice john roberts . trump was also sworn in using two bibles , a bible his mother gifted him and the historic lincoln bible .
although no immediate announcement was made of the second continental congress 's vote for independence -- and so the bell could not have rung on july 4 , 1776 , related to that vote -- bells were rung on july 8 to mark the reading of the united states declaration of independence . while there is no contemporary account of the liberty bell ringing , most historians believe it was one of the bells rung . after american independence was secured , the bell fell into relative obscurity until , in the 1830s , the bell was adopted as a symbol by abolitionist societies , who dubbed it the `` liberty bell '' . michigan remained fairly reliably republican at the presidential level for much of the 20th century . it was part of greater new england , the northern tier of states settled chiefly by migrants from new england who carried their culture with them . the state was one of only a handful to back wendell willkie over franklin roosevelt in 1940 , and supported thomas e. dewey in his losing bid against harry s. truman in 1948 . michigan went to the democrats in presidential elections during the 1960s and voted for the republican candidate in every election from 1972 to 1988 . in addition to the replicas that are seen at independence national historical park , early replicas of the liberty bell include the so-called justice bell or women 's liberty bell , commissioned in 1915 by suffragists to advocate for women 's suffrage . this bell had the same legend as the liberty bell , with two added words , `` establish justice '' , words taken from the preamble to the united states constitution . it also had the clapper chained to the bell so it could not sound , symbolizing the inability of women , lacking the vote , to influence political events . the justice bell toured extensively to publicize the cause .
harriet hall of science-based medicine reviewed the film in an article entitled `` does the movie fed up make sense ? '' in the article she states that the film 's selection of experts consists mainly of politicians and journalists with few relevant nutritional scientists or doctors . she also argues that the definitive pronouncements that the film makes about the role of sugar are premature as there are too many other possible confounders such as lifestyle , total calorie consumption and the type of foods being eaten . hall also goes on to provide a comprehensive list of statements that the film claimed were facts but were not based on scientific evidence . the documentary has been criticized by some doctors and scientists as occasionally misrepresentative of scientific evidence . the film makes the claim that drinking one soda a day will increase a child 's chance of becoming obese by 60 % . the scientists who are the authors of the study that this statistic comes from state that they can not prove this causality , as the film claims , only an association . james o. hill , a pediatrics and medicine professor at the university of colorado school of medicine in denver states that the film presents `` a very myopic view of how obesity develops , and it offers no real solutions '' . the economy appears to have hit a soft patch this winter , but it 's too soon to worry , according to federal reserve chair janet yellen . she blames most of the recent weakness on the weather . over the last month , government data have pointed to weak job growth , as well as declines in retail sales , new home construction and manufacturing . `` part of that softness may reflect adverse weather conditions .

officials in west texas said monday they are investigating the `` suspicious '' death of a 3-year-old boy , adopted from russia , and a russian official blamed the death on `` inhuman abuse . '' the boy was born on january 9 , 2010 , and died on january 21 , 2013 , according to konstantin dolgov , the russian foreign ministry 's special representative for human rights . `` i would like to draw your attention to another case of inhuman abuse of a russian child by u.s. adoptive parents , '' he said in a statement . dolgov claimed the child suffered injuries to his head and legs , as well as to his abdomen and internal organs . by the time republican sen. ted cruz arrived for an event at a gun manufacturing business outside austin , there was a healthy-sized , cheering crowd to greet him . one constituent even held a handmade sign saying , `` ted cruz rocks . '' the scene had the look and feel of a campaign event . except that the freshman senator is n't up for re-election for six years . a russian government child advocate said wednesday he may have spoken too soon when he said a 3-year-old adopted boy who died in texas was `` killed '' or `` murdered . '' at a press conference wednesday , children 's rights commissioner pavel astakhov said he tweeted those words based on the initial reports he received about the death . with the investigation still going , he 's now simply saying the boy `` died . '' still he said , he wants his country to ban all international adoptions of russian children .
in gratitude for his success with touchstone pictures ' good morning , vietnam , robin williams voiced the genie for sag scale pay -- $ 75,000 -- instead of his asking fee of $ 8 million , on condition that his name or image not be used for marketing , and his -lrb- supporting -rrb- character not take more than 25 % of space on advertising artwork , since williams ' film toys was scheduled for release one month after aladdin 's debut . for financial reasons , the studio went back on the deal on both counts , especially in poster art by having the genie in 25 % of the image , but having other major and supporting characters portrayed considerably smaller . the disney hyperion book aladdin : the making of an animated film listed both of williams ' characters `` the peddler '' and `` the genie '' ahead of main characters , but was forced to refer to him only as `` the actor signed to play the genie '' . a large promotion campaign preceded aladdin 's debut in theaters , with the film 's trailer being attached to most disney vhs releases , and numerous tie-ins and licensees being released . after a limited release on november 13 , 1992 , aladdin debuted in 1131 theaters on november 25 , 1992 , grossing $ 19.2 million in its opening weekend -- number two at the box office , behind home alone 2 : lost in new york . it took eight weeks for the film to reach number one at the us box office , breaking the record for the week between christmas and new year 's eve with $ 32.2 million . the film held the top spot five times during its 22-week run . on july 15 , 2015 , the studio announced the development of a live-action comedy adventure prequel called genies . the film was being written by mark swift and damian shannon , while tripp vinson was on board to produce via his vinson films banner . it was intended to serve as a lead to the live-action aladdin film . on november 8 , disney revealed it had originally planned to use robin williams ' unused lines from the 1991 -- 92 recording sessions for the film , but his will prohibited the studio from using his likeness for twenty-five years after his death .
after an election season that has left americans more than a little shaken -lrb- and the rest of the world uneasy about american democracy -rrb- , voters can take comfort knowing that one of the candidates kept her cool through the debates -- despite the insults , the lies , and the endless challenges of the campaign . by doing so , hillary clinton showed she has the mettle required of the next president as he , or more likely she , faces a swarm of increasingly complicated international crises in a male-dominated world . and in the process , she has managed to crush stereotypes about women . america 's rambunctious , costly and seemingly endless election ritual has become a brutal darwinian test of , among other attributes , psychological fortitude . since the formation of nato in 1949 the defense of europe and the free world has depended on the absolute certainty that whatever president is occupying the white house , the united states will come to the aid of a nato member if attacked . any doubt about the american commitment , and the credibility of nato 's doctrine of collective defense , is holed below the waterline . at a time when the west faces a greater threat from a resurgent russia since the most dangerous crises of the cold war , nato , more than ever , needs to stand strong , united and credible . russia 's invasion of crimea and ukraine in 2014 may have already lit the fuse that could lead to the unthinkable : nuclear war with russia in europe . muslim americans describe the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks as a seminal moment that painfully altered their place in american society . but when cnn interviewed american muslims about the presidential election , we heard a startling message : 2016 is worse . cnn traveled last month to three growing muslim communities -- in minneapolis , northern virginia and staten island -- which represent the diversity and increasing political engagement of muslims in the united states . the majority of people we spoke to said it is harder to be a muslim american today than it was even after 9/11 .
by 2015 , a series of swearings-in and other events where biden had placed his hands on women and girls and talked closely to them attracted the attention of both the press and social media . in one case , a senator issued a statement afterward saying about his daughter , `` no , she does n't think the vice president is creepy . '' on january 17 , 2015 , secret service agents heard shots were fired as a vehicle drove near biden 's delaware residence at 8:28 p.m. outside the security perimeter , but the vice president and his wife jill were not home . a vehicle was observed by an agent speeding away . in 2015 , two inebriated senior service agents drove an official car into the white house complex and collided with a barrier . one of the congressmen in the united states house committee on oversight and government reform that investigated that incident was jason chaffetz . in september 2015 , it was revealed that 18 secret service employees or supervisors , including assistant director ed lowery , accessed an unsuccessful 2003 application by chaffetz for employment with the agency and discussed leaking the information to the media in retaliation for chaffetz ' investigations of agency misconduct . the confidential personal information was later leaked to the daily beast . despite moving to number one observatory circle -lrb- the vice presidential residence in washington -rrb- as second lady of the united states , biden intended to keep teaching at a washington-area community college , and several of them recruited her . in january 2009 , she began teaching two english courses as an adjunct professor at the alexandria campus of northern virginia community college -lrb- nova -rrb- , the second largest community college in the nation . it has been rare for second ladies to work while their spouses serve as vice president , and biden is thought to be the first second lady to hold a paying job while her husband was vice president . biden planned to be a public advocate for the importance of community colleges and to advise the obama administration on issues related to them .
the duties of the secretary revolve around human conditions and concerns in the united states . this includes advising the president on matters of health , welfare , and income security programs . the secretary strives to administer the department of health and human services to carry out approved programs and make the public aware of the objectives of the department . a health department or health ministry is a part of government which focuses on issues related to the general health of the citizenry . subnational entities , such as states , counties and cities , often also operate a health department of their own . health departments perform food inspections and other health related inspections -lrb- the person who performs this job is often called a public health inspector -rrb- , vaccination programs , free std and hiv tests , tobacco enforcement and cessation programs , and other medical assistance programs . health departments also compile statistics about health issues of their area.the role of a health department may vary from one country to the other , but their primary objective is always the same ; safeguarding and promoting health . to prevent similar episodes , the homeland security and health & human services departments signed a memorandum of understanding in 2016 , and agreed to establish joint procedures within one year for dealing with unaccompanied migrant children . as of 2018 they have failed to do so . between october and december 2017 , officials from orr tried to contact 7,635 children and their sponsors . from these calls , officials learned that 6,075 children remained with their sponsors .

a fresh series of facebook ads this week by democratic presidential candidate sen. elizabeth warren seeks to put the social media giant on the defensive -- by telling a lie . the ads , which began running widely on thursday , start with a bold but obvious falsehood : that facebook and its ceo mark zuckerberg have endorsed president trump 's reelection campaign . `` you 're probably shocked , '' reads the ad , which has already reached tens of thousands of viewers nationwide . `` and you might be thinking , ` how could this possibly be true ? ' a days-long feud between sen. elizabeth warren and facebook intensified over the weekend as warren openly accused the company of `` taking money to promote lies . '' warren , a leading democratic 2020 candidate , has taken aim at the social media giant over its role in spreading disinformation against her and other candidates . her campaign ran an ad on facebook this past week that contained a deliberate lie to draw further attention to the issue . that provocative move came after a recording leaked earlier this month of ceo mark zuckerberg telling employees that a warren presidency would `` suck '' for the company . facebook ceo mark zuckerberg sought to recast the challenges facing his company in a historical light on thursday , describing social media as a kind of `` fifth estate '' and describing politicians ' calls to clamp down on tech companies as an effort to restrict the freedom of expression . in a speech citing landmark supreme court cases and historical figures such as frederick douglass , zuckerberg told an audience at georgetown university that during times of social upheaval , policymakers have instinctively sought to limit the freedom of speech . `` the impulse is to pull back from free expression , '' he said . but , he continued , `` we are at a crossroads .

early modern europe is the period of european history between the end of the middle ages and the beginning of the industrial revolution , roughly the late 15th century to the late 18th century . historians variously mark the beginning of the early modern period with the invention of moveable type printing in the 1450s , the fall of constantinople in 1453 , the end of the wars of the roses in 1487 , the beginning of the high renaissance in italy in the 1490s , the end of the reconquista and subsequent voyages of christopher columbus to the americas in 1492 , or the start of the protestant reformation in 1517 . the precise dates of its end point also vary and are usually linked with either the start of the french revolution in 1789 or with the more vaguely defined beginning of the industrial revolution in late 18th century england . some of the more notable trends and events of the early modern period included the reformation and the religious conflicts it provoked -lrb- including the french wars of religion and the thirty years ' war -rrb- , the rise of capitalism and modern nation states , widespread witch hunts and european colonization of the americas . morning is the period of time from sunrise to noon . there are no exact times for when morning begins -lrb- also true for evening and night -rrb- because it can vary according to one 's lifestyle and the hours of daylight at each time of year . however , morning strictly ends at noon , which is when afternoon starts . morning can be defined as starting from midnight to noon , or from sunrise -lrb- which varies throughout the year -rrb- to noon , or from when one wakes up to noon.morning precedes afternoon , evening , and night in the sequence of a day . early is a 2005 compilation by scritti politti which collects singles and eps recorded in the first years of the band 's existence , during its early incarnation as a diy post-punk act characterized by an experimental musical approach and leftist political concerns . following these recordings , leader green gartside would abandon the group 's avant-garde leanings and attempt a more commercial musical direction .

bush and his family moved to washington , d.c. , in 1988 to work on his father 's campaign for the u.s. presidency . he served as a campaign advisor and liaison to the media , and assisted his father by campaigning across the country . in december 1991 , bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father 's 1992 presidential re-election campaign , as a `` campaign advisor '' . the previous month , his father had asked him to tell white house chief of staff john h. sununu he should resign . as a check on the regional , popular , and rapidly changing politics of the house , the senate has several distinct powers . for example , the `` advice and consent '' powers -lrb- such as the power to approve treaties and confirm members of the cabinet -rrb- are a sole senate privilege . the house , however , has the exclusive power to initiate bills for raising revenue , to impeach officials , and to choose the president in the event that a presidential candidate fails to get a majority of the electoral college votes . the senate and house are further differentiated by term lengths and the number of districts represented : the senate has longer terms of six years , fewer members -lrb- currently one hundred , two for each state -rrb- , and -lrb- in all but seven delegations -rrb- larger constituencies per member . the constitution authorizes the senate to elect a president pro tempore -lrb- latin for `` president for a time '' -rrb- who presides over the chamber in the vice president 's absence , and is , by custom , the senator of the majority party with the longest record of continuous service . like the vice president , the president pro tempore does not normally preside over the senate , but typically delegates the responsibility of presiding to a majority-party senator who presides over the senate , usually in blocks of one hour on a rotating basis . frequently , freshmen senators -lrb- newly elected members -rrb- are asked to preside so that they may become accustomed to the rules and procedures of the body . it is said that , `` in practice they are usually mere mouthpieces for the senate 's parliamentarian , who whispers what they should do '' .
-lrb- born 1944 , los angeles , california , usa -rrb- determined in the mid-1970s that the social forces that give paintings meaning may be better understood if the `` painting '' itself could be reduced to a generic form -- a painting that could read as a `` sign '' for a painting , '' which could function of a `` placeholder , '' or a kind of `` prop . '' in the 1970s and early 80s he painted what he called surrogate paintings , and ultimately began casting them in plaster , frame and all . these hundreds of objects that looked like framed , matted , fields of painted blackness , worked as neutral , `` generic signs '' that might inspire the viewer to think about the social expectations that constructed the `` idea '' of a painting , '' more than the actual painting itself . by reducing paintings to mere signs of themselves , mccollum turned the gallery and the museum setting into a kind of theater , highlighting the drama of presenting , displaying , buying and selling , exchanging , photographing , assessing , criticising , choosing , and writing about the works ; the object-paintings at the center of the action were purposely rendered moot , in order to turn one 's attention to the supplementary devices and social practices that , in the end , bestow the value on the work . we cubists have only done our duty by creating a new rhythm for the benefit of humanity . others will come after us who will do the same . what will they find ? that is the tremendous secret of the future . born archibald lee wright , the son of thomas wright , a farm laborer and drifter , and lorena wright . he always insisted that he was born in 1916 in collinsville , illinois , but his mother told reporters that he was actually born in 1913 in benoit , mississippi . his father abandoned the family when archie was an infant . unable to provide for him and his older sister , his mother gave them into the care of an uncle and aunt , cleveland and willie pearl moore , who lived in st. louis .
in 2014 zee news reported that bruce riede -lrb- a former cia analyst and national security council official for south asia -rrb- accused the pakistan military intelligence -- inter-services intelligence -lrb- isi -rrb- -- of organising and assisting al-qaeda to organise in india , that pakistan ought to be warned that it will be placed on the list of state sponsors of terrorism , and wrote that `` zawahiri made the tape in his hideout in pakistan , no doubt , and many indians suspect the isi is helping to protect him '' . the reality was that bin laden and ayman al-zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy . but there was no organization . these were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin laden for funding and assistance . he was not their commander . during the 2001 trial , the us department of justice needed to show that bin laden was the leader of a criminal organization in order to charge him in absentia under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act . the name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of jamal al-fadl , who said he was a founding member of the group and a former employee of bin laden . questions about the reliability of al-fadl 's testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty , and because he was delivering it as part of a plea bargain agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack us military establishments . sam schmidt , a defense attorney who defended al-fadl said :
the first public radio network in the united states was founded in 1949 in berkeley , california , as station kpfa , which became and remains the flagship station for a national network called pacifica radio . from the beginning , the network has refused corporate funding of any kind , and has relied mainly on listener support . kpfa gave away free fm radios to build a listener base and to encourage listeners to `` subscribe '' -lrb- support the station directly with donations -rrb- . it is the world 's oldest listener-supported radio network . the organization 's legal name is national public radio and its trademarked brand is npr ; it is known by both names . in june 2010 , the organization announced that it was `` making a conscious effort to consistently refer to ourselves as npr on-air and online '' because npr is the common name for the organization and the tag line `` this ... is npr '' has been used by its radio hosts for many years . however , national public radio remains the legal name of the group , as it has been since 1970 . as of september 2011 , mpr was equal with wnyc for most listener support for a public radio network , and had the highest level of recurring monthly donors of any public radio network in the united states .
the platform included a plan to pay off the national debt by 2012 . gore 's platform stated : `` this fiscally-disciplined approach assures that our children will not be saddled with debt - and the enormous annual interest burden on that debt - and the costs of paying for the baby boomers ' retirement . '' gore 's balanced budget plan also devoted the $ 2.3 trillion social security surplus exclusively to social security and the national debt , thereby extending solvency `` through at least 2054 '' . a harper 's magazine column by linda bilmes , a lecturer in public finance at harvard 's kennedy school of government , and joseph stiglitz titled `` the $ 10 trillion hangover : paying the price for eight years of bush '' , `` estimate that the cost of undoing the bush administration 's economic choices , from the wars in iraq and afghanistan to the collapse of the financial system , soaring debt and new commitments to interest payments and medicare , all add up to over $ 10 trillion '' . see also national debt graph : bush sets 50-year record . the national debt from george washington to the beginning of ronald reagan 's term totaled about one trillion dollars . gore 's platform involved creating a `` medicare lock box '' designed so that medicare payroll taxes could only be used to strengthen medicare and pay down the national debt .
in the 2012 u.s. presidential election sarandon , along with film director michael moore , said that they were not thrilled with obama 's performance but hoped he would be re-elected . she said she and the administration have n't been allies . `` i would n't say the white house has taken me under its wing and made me one of its best buddies , '' sarandon said . reviewing the religion of the future in notre dame philosophical reviews , jeremy david bendik-keymer considered the book as the second part of the project that unger began in the self awakened : pragmatism unbound and concluded in the singular universe and the reality of time . bendik-keymer summarizes unger 's project in these works as one that `` seeks a world in which we live in the present , free of repression of , or reactive attitudes towards , the existential limitations of being human and in which we act collectively to create the conditions for ongoing innovation and self-transformation '' -lrb- internal citations omitted -rrb- . bendik-keymer complains that unger 's depiction of human beings is `` belittling '' and concludes that unger `` has simply missed the mark ... unger may think of his work as preparation for prophesy , but it ends up as pontification . '' the original requirement was only that the nominated song appear in a motion picture during the previous year . this rule was changed after the 1941 academy awards , when `` the last time i saw paris '' , from the film lady be good , with music by jerome kern and lyrics by oscar hammerstein ii , won . kern was upset that his song won because it had been published and recorded before it was used in the film . the song was actually written in 1940 , after the germans occupied paris at the start of world war ii .
exes gwyneth paltrow and chris martin have managed to segue their past love into more of a sibling type situation . the actress and `` goop '' founder appeared on `` the late show with stephen colbert '' thursday and talked about her relationship with the coldplay frontman . the pair famously decided to `` consciously uncouple '' in 2014 after 11 years of marriage and two children , but paltrow said they are still close . `` he 's really like my brother , '' paltrow told colbert . the pink ralph lauren dress of gwyneth paltrow refers to the pink dress , designed by ralph lauren , which gwyneth paltrow wore to the 71st academy awards on 21 march 1999 at the dorothy chandler pavilion in los angeles . the dress is cited by several sources as one of the greatest dresses in the history of the red carpet of the oscars , and the style was compared to that of the actress grace kelly . the dress was widely copied after the event , and paltrow was credited for bringing pink back into fashion . 6ix . in 2019 , pitt parodied the iconic ending of the movie se7en for mother 's brewing company and a beer named after his likeness called doin ' good . pitt does a wholesome interpretation of his brother brad 's role as detective david mills and delivers the movie 's most famous line , `` what 's in the booooooox ?

japan society was soon incorporated under new york law and finally found a home near one of russell 's work offices , though it continued to relocate throughout its history before its current headquarters was opened in 1971 . at this time , japan society and its members began to express interest in improving teaching about japan in the united states . the organization began sponsoring trips to the country , publishing books , and sent a report to the department of education about the portrayal of japan in american textbooks . john d. rockefeller iii served as president from 1952 to 1969 and then as chairman of the board until his death in 1978 . he accompanied john foster dulles on his trip to japan that eventually led to the signing of the 1951 treaty . rockefeller , a supporter of the institute of pacific relations who visited japan in 1929 during one of its conferences , wanted to contribute to bettering us -- japan relations after the war and believed there needed to be non-governmental organizations like japan society in each country in order for such friendly relations to exist . it remained active during world war i , operating as it had for the last seven years , but the organization became more political when it began associating with the anti-alien legislation committee , an advocacy group that spoke out against yellow peril . russell and hamilton holt , another founding member , used the organization 's publications to defend all of japan 's actions at the time . unbeknownst to anyone at the time , even one of japan society 's writers secretly worked for the japanese government with the task of improving japan 's image in the united states . the organization eventually realized the dangers of taking sides and by 1924 stopped publishing any political commentary .
general mills came out with their `` monster cereals '' in the 1970s . the cereals are now produced and sold seasonally around halloween . since 2004 , general mills has been producing more products targeted to the growing ranks of health-conscious consumers . the company has chosen to switch its entire breakfast cereal line to whole grain . the company also started manufacturing their child-targeted cereals with less sugar . general mills has reduced the level of sugar in all cereals advertised to children to 11 grams per serving . the company announced in september 2014 that it would acquire organic food producer annie 's inc. for a fee of around $ 820 million , as part of its strategy to expand in the us natural foods market . in october 2014 , general mills announced plans to cut 700 to 800 jobs , mostly in u.s. , in corporate restructuring planned to be completed by the end of 2015 .
triumphant republicans return to washington wednesday to prepare for a new era of gop dominance on both sides of the capitol . but first , they have to get through a short , final senate session under democratic control . the post-election lame duck session should be fast-paced as lawmakers work to clear leftover business , including a must pass bill to fund the government , and other bills to arm syrian rebels and extend expiring tax breaks . republican leaders are anxious to start the new congress in january with a clean slate when they could control as many as 54 seats . time to brush off the veto stamp . for someone who 's only used it twice , president obama may need some reacquainting with the last remaining weapon in democrats ' arsenal . he last rejected a bill from congress in 2010 . but he 's had blocking from a democratic senate majority until now . senate majority leader harry reid has a surprising message for president barack obama : not so fast on using that executive power to change immigration laws . to be sure -- reid said he supports any presidential move to go around a stalemated congress and help illegal immigrants by executive order , but he wants the president to hold off until congress approves a bill to fund the government . the democratic leader told cnn in a hallway interview thursday that he has privately conveyed to the white house his concern : that the move will anger republicans and threaten passage of the must-pass spending bill . that could lead to a government shutdown .
bush initially sought a $ 1.6 trillion tax cut over a ten-year period , but ultimately settled for a $ 1.35 trillion tax cut . the administration rejected the idea of `` triggers '' that would phase out the tax reductions should the government again run deficits . the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 won the support of congressional republicans and a minority of congressional democrats , and bush signed it into law in june 2001 . the act lowered the top income tax rate from 39 percent to 35 percent , and it also reduced the estate tax . the surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $ 237 billion -- the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever . in 2001 , bush 's budget estimated that there would be a $ 5.6 trillion surplus over the next ten years . facing congressional opposition , bush held townhall style meetings across the u.s. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $ 1.35 trillion tax cut program -- one of the largest tax cuts in u.s. history . bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers , saying `` the surplus is not the government 's money . in fact , according to the former world bank vice-president , joseph stiglitz , when factors like medical and welfare costs of us military servicemen are added in , the cost to date is closer to $ 3.3 trillion . however , continues stiglitz , `` three trillion is a very conservative number , the true costs are likely to be much larger than that ... the money being spent on the war each week would be enough to wipe out illiteracy around the world ... just a few days ' funding would be enough to provide health insurance for us children who were not covered , '' he said .

irish whiskey -lrb- irish : fuisce or uisce beatha -rrb- is whiskey made on the island of ireland . the word ` whiskey ' -lrb- or whisky -rrb- comes from the irish -lrb- or ` gaelic ' -rrb- uisce beatha , meaning water of life . irish whiskey was once the most popular spirit in the world , though a long period of decline from the late 19th century onwards greatly damaged the industry . so much so that although ireland boasted over 30 distilleries in the 1890s , a century later , this number had fallen to just three . northern ireland -lrb- irish : tuaisceart éireann -lrb- listen -rrb- ; ulster-scots : norlin airlann -rrb- is variously described as a country , province or region which is part of the united kingdom . located in the northeast of the island of ireland , northern ireland shares a border to the south and west with the republic of ireland . in 2011 , its population was 1,810,863 , constituting about 30 % of the island 's total population and about 3 % of the uk 's population . established by the northern ireland act 1998 as part of the good friday agreement , the northern ireland assembly -lrb- colloquially referred to as stormont after its location -rrb- holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters , while other areas are reserved for the british government . the irish -lrb- irish : muintir na héireann or na héireannaigh -rrb- are a nation and ethnic group native to the island of ireland , who share a common irish ancestry , identity and culture . ireland has been inhabited for about 12,500 years according to archaeological studies -lrb- see prehistoric ireland -rrb- . for most of ireland 's recorded history , the irish have been primarily a gaelic people -lrb- see gaelic ireland -rrb- . from the 9th century , small numbers of vikings settled in ireland , becoming the norse-gaels .
bernie sanders on monday and tuesday led an orchestrated attempt by democratic leaders to pull their party together , but simmering anger among his die-hard supporters proved that democratic unity will be a work in progress . on a dramatic first night of the democratic convention , michelle obama brought the house down with an emphatic endorsement of hillary clinton . the first lady said she was the person most qualified to be president , and `` i 'm with her . '' other democratic headliners , including sens. bernie sanders sought to show a united front at the democratic national convention tuesday by asking delegates to accept hillary clinton 's nomination unanimously and by acclimation . the plan came at the end of the roll call vote of all 50 states . `` i move that hillary clinton be selected as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states , '' sanders told the convention . the move came as sanders has attempted to tamp down his rowdy supporters , at times getting booed by his own backers as he called for democratic unity . former democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders tried monday to calm a crowd skeptical of hillary clinton , using a rally in advance of his convention speech to call for the party to unify against republican presidential nominee donald trump . `` we have got to elect hillary clinton and tim kaine , '' bernie sanders said , which prompted some attendees to shout him down . `` brothers and sisters , brothers and sisters , this is the real world that we live in , '' sanders said , before adding , `` trump has made bigotry and hatred the cornerstone of his campaign . throughout this campaign he has insulted mexicans and latinos .
egmont arens was hired in the 1930s to design a low-cost series of mixers . this resulted in the production of the kitchenaid model `` k '' which showed streamlined lines for the first time , and the kitchenaid standard design has remained relatively unchanged since then . the silhouette has since been made a registered trademark with the u.s. patent and trademark office . in 1997 the san francisco museum of modern art selected the kitchenaid stand mixer as an icon of american design . the same month , following the publication of the investigation results into the shepard 's bush blaze that concluded the faulty tumble dryer was to blame for starting the fire and other fires across the uk , pressure grew on whirlpool and the government to do more to reassure the public . dave brown , london fire brigade 's director of operations , said , `` this fire has highlighted just how dangerous faulty white goods can be ... disappointingly though , whirlpool have still not changed their advice to consumers . we are now appealing once again for them to change their advice and bring it into line with our own . thankfully there were no serious injuries in the shepherd 's bush fire but we may not be so lucky if it happens again .

the american psychoanalytic association -lrb- apsaa -rrb- , a different organization from the apa , sent a letter on june 6 , 2017 , that highlighted differences between the apa and apsaa ethical guidelines , stating that `` the american psychiatric association 's ethical stance on the goldwater rule applies to its members only . apsaa does not consider political commentary by its individual members an ethical matter . '' in july 2017 , the website stat published an article by sharon begley , labeled `` exclusive '' and titled `` psychiatry group tells members they can defy ` goldwater rule ' and comment on trump 's mental health '' . the article , with a photograph of barry goldwater as the headline image , stated that `` a leading psychiatry group has told its members they should not feel bound by a longstanding rule against commenting publicly on the mental state of public figures '' , first sourcing the statement to the july 6 american psychoanalytic association -lrb- apsaa -rrb- letter , but also claiming that it `` represents the first significant crack in the profession 's decades-old united front aimed at preventing experts from discussing the psychiatric aspects of politicians ' behavior '' ; the article then repeatedly referred to the `` goldwater rule '' , quoted an unnamed source as saying `` leadership has been extremely reluctant to make a statement and publicly challenge the american psychiatric association '' , and claimed that an unnamed `` official '' had said that `` although the american psychological association ` prefers ' that its members not offer opinions on the psychology of someone they have not examined , it does not have a goldwater rule and is not considering implementing one '' . there was extensive analysis and comment on dsm-iv -lrb- published in 1994 -rrb- in the years leading up to the 2013 publication of dsm-5 . it was alleged that the way the categories of dsm-iv were structured , as well as the substantial expansion of the number of categories within it , represented increasing medicalization of human nature , very possibly attributable to disease mongering by psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies , the power and influence of the latter having grown dramatically in recent decades . in 2005 , then apa president steven sharfstein released a statement in which he conceded that psychiatrists had `` allowed the biopsychosocial model to become the bio-bio-bio model '' . reported that of the authors who selected and defined the dsm-iv psychiatric disorders , roughly half had financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry during the period 1989-2004 , raising the prospect of a direct conflict of interest . in the 1964 election , fact magazine polled american psychiatric association members on whether barry goldwater was fit to be president and published `` the unconscious of a conservative : a special issue on the mind of barry goldwater '' . this led to a ban on the diagnosis of a public figure by psychiatrists who have not performed an examination or been authorized to release information by the patient . this became the goldwater rule .

after one day where truth and facts triumphed , america is back to its alternative realities . the convictions of two close associates of president donald trump in a mind-bending double-header drama in two cities on tuesday were a moment of clarity in the legal morass that has thickened around the white house over the last 19 months . yet anyone who thought that being implicated in a crime in one of the most sensational political moments of recent history would soon temper trump 's behavior , stop his white house peddling untruths or reshape the political terrain that sustains his presidency is being disappointed -- at least for now . certainly , in years to come that tumultuous hour on tuesday could turn out to be the moment when the trump presidency began to unravel and the teflon armor that shielded the president from scandals and outrages that would doom normal politicians was finally penetrated . over the weekend , we learned that white house counsel don mcgahn spent 30 hours talking to special counsel robert mueller 's office about the ongoing investigation into russia 's meddling in the 2016 presidential election , the possibility of collusion between the trump campaign and russians and the idea that donald trump himself may have sought to obstruct the investigation . on monday , we learned that trump was surprised -- and bothered -- that he did n't know the extent of the time mcgahn spent with mueller 's team or , exactly , what was discussed . this , from cnn 's kaitlan collins , kevin liptak and jeremy diamond , is telling : `` the president was unsettled by the notion that he did n't know everything mcgahn said to the special counsel during their interviews , the sources said . and while he had approved the cooperation , trump did not know the conversations stretched for 30 hours or that his legal team did n't conduct a full debriefing with mcgahn after the fact . the ongoing trial of former trump campaign chairman paul manafort on a series of financial crimes is n't the buzziest story of the week . that title goes to the release of reality tv villain and former white house official omarosa manigault newman 's tell-all memoir about her time at 1600 pennsylvania avenue . but it is the most important story of the week -- and one with the broadest implications as to what donald trump 's presidency will be like going forward . friday , the trial was in its 14th day .

mike then needs to select a new vice president , and he picks carol . he asks congress for permission to appoint her and initially , the speaker of the house , sal astor , is skeptical of carol 's abilities but she wins congress over with a song and dance number . mike settles in nicely as president and pushes to make the country even greater without playing into petty politics . meanwhile , veronica dotwebb grumbles to astor that he should be president and the two plot to overthrow mike and carol by ruining their image . as a montage of multiple stations discussing the brady story , the original owner is being sentenced to execution on death row and is unable to claim his winnings . since he is not able to find the original owner , mike decides to donate the money to charity , which attracts the attention of the president of the united states , president randolph . president randolph then invites him to a press conference where the president is asked about his dealings with an oil drilling company that has been abusing the environment . president randolph insists that he has never had any dealing with the company and swears to resign if he is disproven . mike address the public telling them he received a report from nasa that confirms a massive meteor is on a course and will cause global devastation . the bradys are then transported to a secret bunker underneath the white house that will protect them from the ensuing danger . sal astor then seizes the opportunity to take power by calling an official press conference as acting president and mocks mike brady for falling for the hoax . embarrassed , the public demands mike 's impeachment but cindy overhears sal and veronica plotting and she informs the family so they can stop them .
in november 2017 , the full homeland security committee held a hearing to understand how fast the u.s. government could install ct scanners into every airport in the country in order to fight threats to airlines . the hearing focused on the transportation security administration 's -lrb- tsa -rrb- role in keeping the country secure . the hearing was scheduled because a classified security briefing that was held earlier revealed vulnerabilities to the aviation system that concerned committee members . the latest threats , according to committee chairman michael mccaul , `` were terrorists using electronic devices and laptops as bombs , and exploding the device on an airplane while the plane is in flight . '' while picking lahood drew praise for its bipartisan symbolism there was also a sense that lahood 's lack of expertise would diminish the department 's role in 2009 major policy debates and leave him as more of a ceremonial figure . james oberstar , the democratic congressman who chaired the house transportation and infrastructure committee , was expected to hold more influence and will likely play a stronger leading role . oberstar praised lahood 's `` temperament '' and `` managerial talent , '' but when asked to cite an issue lahood championed during his time on the transportation committee in the 1990s , oberstar seemingly drew a blank . `` i ca n't point to any specific legislation that he authored , '' he said . in a 60 minutes profile of secretary johnson that aired in april 2015 , it was stated : `` o far he 's gotten high marks , even from the republicans in congress . when he came on board , nearly half the senior management jobs were vacant ; he 's filled all but one ; he 's boosted morale ; and improved the coordination and dissemination of threat information throughout the government .

debate continued regarding the nature of al-qaeda 's role in the 9/11 attacks . the us state department released a videotape showing bin laden speaking with a small group of associates somewhere in afghanistan shortly before the taliban was removed from power . although its authenticity has been questioned by a couple of people , the tape definitively implicates bin laden and al-qaeda in the september 11 attacks . the tape was aired on many television channels , with an accompanying english translation provided by the us defense department . in january 2003 , the cia released a special report to congress entitled iraqi support for terrorism . the report concludes that `` in contrast to the patron-client pattern between iraq and its palestinian surrogates , the relationship between iraq and al-qaida appears to more closely resemble that of two independent actors trying to exploit each other -- their mutual suspicion suborned by al-qaida 's interest in iraqi assistance , and baghdad 's interest in al-qaida 's anti-u.s. attacks . ... the intelligence community has no credible information that baghdad had foreknowledge of the 11 september attacks or any other al-qaida strike . '' in january 2003 , british intelligence completed a classified report on iraq that concluded that `` there are no current links between the iraqi regime and the al-qaeda network . '' the report was leaked to the bbc , who published information about it on february 5 , the same day colin powell addressed the united nations . according to bbc , the report `` says al-qaeda leader osama bin laden views iraq 's ruling ba'ath party as running contrary to his religion , calling it an ` apostate regime ' . ` his aims are in ideological conflict with present day iraq , ' it says .

at least six attempts have been made to merge the los angeles airport police into the los angeles police department since the early 1970s . a number of outside studies have been commissioned resulting in recommendations that the forces not be merged . the latest study was in 2004 -- 2005 and contained almost identical recommendations as put forth in a 1984 study . in 1999 , a new city charter clause stipulated that the airport police would be under the autonomous control of los angeles world airports . another challenge that the los angeles county jail faces is violence within the jail community . many researchers assert that the violence seen in jails is in part due to males wanting to maintain a position of superiority . because those who appear to be weak tend to become victims of sexual violence in jail , some men attempt to demonstrate to others that they are too strong to be taken advantage of . this level of heightened masculinity is also called hypermasculinity , and has the potential to manifest itself in the form of violence in a prison setting . currently , the lasd is working with the faa and local government officials to deploy their remote control aerial surveillance drone system . this would allow the sheriff 's department to have real time imagery from the streets of los angeles to combat street violence and record crimes in progress , not to mention searching for missing hikers , `` patrolling '' behind the surf zones of the beaches and looking for lost children . the drones are not intended to replace police helicopters , but in specific incidents could be better , cheaper and quieter to use .
after a campaign season marked mainly by democrats fleeing his shadow , president barack obama embarked upon the final push of what he calls his last campaign sunday , hoping to mobilize voters in the few pockets of the country where he remains somewhat popular . obama headlined afternoon campaign rallies for democratic gubernatorial candidates in connecticut and pennsylvania , capping off a cycle that saw him rally for only one senate candidate and a handful of governors . his diminished presence in 2014 amounted mostly to headlining high-dollar fundraisers in wealthy neighborhoods , mostly on the coasts , where he sought to motivate donors amid bleak prospects for his party in tuesday 's midterm elections . in tight races across the country , democrats have distanced themselves from his policies , declaring themselves independent from the white house as republicans worked overtime to lump them into the same unpopular mold . president barack obama walked into the white house nearly six years ago with a robust senate majority and a promise to change politics . now , he 's heading into his final years of office estranged from democrats in the minority on capitol hill , facing republicans uninterested in making big compromises and a public that has largely moved on from the heady early days of the administration . obama is `` anxious to get back to work '' and put the midterms behind him , according to a white house official who spoke on the condition of anonymity , adding the president regards the final two years of his term as a `` fourth quarter '' with the potential for real action . he is scheduled to address the midterm results on wednesday afternoon , just as he did in 2010 when he labeled the republican takeover the house a `` shellacking .

'' the audience initially laughed at richards using the terms `` afromerican '' and `` afro americans '' and during pauses in his explanation and apology ; at one point seinfeld rebuked the audience , `` stop laughing , it 's not funny . '' richards said he had been trying to defuse heckling by being even more outrageous , but it had backfired . for many years , leary had been friends with fellow comedian bill hicks . but when leary 's comedy album no cure for cancer was released , leary was accused of stealing hicks ' act and material , and the friendship ended abruptly . in april 1993 , the austin comedy news remarked on the similarities of leary 's performance : `` watching leary is like seeing hicks from two years ago . he smokes with the same mannerisms . the laugh factory presents is an online stand-up comedy series , which masada created for up-and-coming comedians to spread their material to a wider audience via youtube and amazon.com . masada 's plan is to film comedians ' shows on the laugh factory stage and allow them to keep 80 % of the profits made from the specials . with the help of laugh factory new media , masada produced two the laugh factory presents specials , the laugh factory presents tim gaither live from las vegas and the laugh factory presents raj sharma live from las vegas .
president donald trump ordered the firing of special counsel robert mueller last june , only to be talked out of doing so when white house general counsel don mcgahn refused to follow through because he disagreed with the president 's reasoning , a source told cnn thursday night . that 's a wow . especially because time and time again over the past year , trump -- and his senior advisers -- have insisted that he had never , ever , never , not once considered anything like firing mueller . `` i have n't given it any thought , '' trump replied in august -- two months after he reportedly ordered mueller fired -- to a question from a reporter as to whether he had considered firing the special counsel . president donald trump denied on friday that he had moved to fire special counsel robert mueller . he had called for the firing last june , according to one person familiar with the matter . white house counsel don mcgahn refused to order the justice department to fire mueller because he disagreed with the president 's reasoning , the source said . however , according to the source , mcgahn did not threaten to resign directly to the president . months after his reported effort to fire special counsel robert mueller , president donald trump is still fuming over the russia investigation and has deputy attorney general rod rosenstein in his crosshairs . the president has been venting about rosenstein -- who oversees mueller and the special counsel investigation -- in recent weeks , according to four sources familiar with the situation . at times , trump even gripes about wanting rosenstein removed , two of those sources said . one source said the president makes comments like `` let 's fire him , let 's get rid of him '' before his advisers convince him it 's an ill-fated idea .
in an address before both houses of congress on september 20 , 2001 , bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the september 11 attacks . he specifically thanked uk prime minister tony blair for traveling to washington to show `` unity of purpose with america '' , and said `` america has no truer friend than great britain . '' president bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of america 's most serious social problems . he often used the `` thousand points of light '' theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems . in his 1989 inaugural address , president bush said , `` i have spoken of a thousand points of light , of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the nation , doing good . '' during his presidency , bush honored numerous volunteers with the daily point of light award , a tradition that was continued by his presidential successors . since leaving office , bush has kept a relatively low profile though he has made public appearances , most notably after the release of his memoirs in 2010 and for the 10th anniversary of the september 11 attacks in 2011 . in march 2009 , he delivered his first post-presidency speech in calgary , alberta , appeared via video on the colbert report during which he praised u.s. troops for earning a `` special place in american history , '' and attended the funeral of senator ted kennedy . bush made his debut as a motivational speaker on october 26 at the `` get motivated '' seminar in dallas . in the aftermath of the fort hood shooting on november 5 , 2009 , the bushes paid an undisclosed visit to the survivors and the victims ' families the day following the shooting , having contacted the base commander requesting that the visit be private and not involve press coverage .
in 1895 , the first audubon society was created . cousins and boston socialites harriet hemenway and minna b. hall , disturbed by the destruction left by plume hunters , organized a series of afternoon teas with other wealthy local women , encouraging them to avoid feathered garments . they also sent literature asking these women to , in hall 's words , `` join a society for the protection of birds , especially the egret . '' finally , new jersey audubon also sponsors numerous field trips to various sites of environmental importance throughout new jersey and beyond . many of these trips are aimed primarily at birders , although trips focused on butterflies , dragonflies , reptiles and amphibians , hiking , canoeing , and caving , among other topics , are also offered on a regular basis . new jersey audubon also sponsors the annual world series of birding , perhaps the world 's most famous birdwatching competition . competing teams seek to find as many bird species as they can in the state of new jersey , or a section thereof , on a saturday in mid-may . organizations for the protection of birds were not a wholly new idea . even before grinnell 's audubon society was organized , the american ornithologists ' union , founded in 1883 , was aware of the dangers facing many birds in the united states . there were , however , influential ornithologists who defended the collection of birds . in 1902 , charles b. cory , the president-elect of the aou refused to attend a meeting of the district of columbia audubon society stating that `` i do not protect birds .
us ambassador to the united nations nikki haley slammed russia at the gop retreat in west virginia on thursday , definitively telling republican lawmakers that moscow `` is not , will not , be our friend . '' `` as long as their government has the values that it has , and as long as it conducts itself the way it does internationally , '' haley said . haley made it very clear that russia meddled in the 2016 us election but also noted that `` there is no reason to think the russian interference made any difference between who won and lost . '' `` the very fact that they did it is an outrageous thing , and something the administration is taking steps to prevent in the future , '' haley said . ever wonder who might see the data from your fitbit ? it turns out it could be just about anybody -- and that has the pentagon worried . twenty-year-old australian college student nathan ruser analyzed a heat map produced by data aggregator strava , and what he found shows just how vulnerable troops deployed to hostile areas could be . but that vulnerability has much broader implications for the future of warfare . the trump administration extended protections for roughly 7,000 syrian nationals in the us due to the ongoing civil war in the country , the agency announced wednesday evening . but syrians who arrived in the us after august 2016 will not be eligible under the new policy . the protections for syria were first enacted in 2012 and shield recipients from deportation while authorizing them to work in the us . the roughly 7,000 syrians covered under temporary protected status program will have their protections for another 18 months .
polls show that massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren is now a front-runner for the 2020 democratic nomination . and on tuesday night in ohio , her 11 rivals acted like it . the party 's fourth presidential debate , hosted by cnn and the new york times , showcased the shifting dynamics of the democratic primary . warren was under attack all night -- though it 's far from clear whether anyone dented her status at the top of the field . for four democrats , the cnn/new york times presidential debate on tuesday night could have been their last . sen. amy klobuchar of minnesota , former rep. beto o'rourke of texas , former housing and urban development secretary julián castro and rep. tulsi gabbard of hawaii walked onstage here at otterbein university with a stark reality looming : this could be their last debate , as none of them have yet qualified for the november contest . to make the november debate stage , candidates will have to reach 3 % in at least four democratic national committee-approved polls of democratic voters nationally or in one of the four early-voting states -- iowa , new hampshire , nevada and south carolina -- and raise money from 165,000 separate donors -- including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories . the reality for the four democrats on the bubble is that none of them are that close to making the fourth debate . a dozen -lrb- ! -rrb- democratic presidential candidates took the stage in ohio for the fourth debate of the 2020 election , the largest field ever to participate in a single debate . i watched , took notes , tweeted and picked some of the best -- and the worst -- of the night . my winners and losers are below .
there has been ad hoc appointment in the supreme court made when the quorum of judges is not possible to complete the sitting number of justices in the court , or if it is necessary to increase the number of justices in the supreme court . the nomination comes directly from the judicial commission chiared by the chief justice who prepares the nomination summary as president confirms their appointments . the supreme court initially had its seat at the chamber of princes in the parliament building where the previous federal court of india sat from 1937 to 1950 . the first chief justice of india was h. j. kania . in 1958 , the supreme court moved to its present premises . originally , the constitution of india envisaged a supreme court with a chief justice and seven judges ; leaving it to the parliament to increase this number . if not all of the nine justices vote on a case , or the court has a vacancy , then a tied vote is possible . if this occurs , then the decision of the court below is affirmed , but the case is not considered to be binding precedent . the effect is a return to the status quo ante . no opinions -lrb- or voting alignments -rrb- are issued in such a case , only the one-sentence announcement that `` he judgment is affirmed by an equally divided court . ''
in a posting on the venezuelan president 's official twitter account , hugo chavez said monday that he had returned to venezuela from cuba , where was treated for cancer . `` we have arrived again in the venezuelan homeland , '' it read . `` thank god ! thank you dear people ! `` today , the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades . fidel castro 's legacy is one of firing squads , theft , unimaginable suffering , poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.while cuba remains a totalitarian island , it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long , and toward a future in which the wonderful cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.though the tragedies , deaths and pain caused by fidel castro can not be erased , our administration will do all it can to ensure the cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty . i join the many cuban americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign , including the brigade 2506 veterans association that endorsed me , with the hope of one day soon seeing a free cuba . '' the u.s. government is applying new pressure on cuba to release an american contractor , who officials say suffers from chronic health problems . one of the largest congressional delegations to the island in recent memory arrived in havana on monday with hopes of freeing alan gross . gross is serving a 15-year jail sentence for bringing banned satellite communications equipment into cuba as part of a state department program to spread democracy . gross , who has been held since 2009 , said he was working to connect cuba 's small jewish community to the internet .
the presidency of barack obama began at noon est on january 20 , 2009 , when barack obama was inaugurated as the 44th president of the united states , and ended on january 20 , 2017 . obama , a democrat from illinois , took office following a decisive victory over republican john mccain in the 2008 presidential election . four years later , in the 2012 election , he defeated republican mitt romney to win re-election . he was the first african american president , the first multiracial president , the first non-white president , and the first president to have been born in hawaii . on april 4 , 2011 , obama announced that he would seek re-election in the 2012 presidential election . obama did not face any significant rivals for the 2012 democratic nomination . obama 's republican opponent in the general election , former governor mitt romney of massachusetts , advocated for lower taxes , spending cuts , an increase in defense spending , and a repeal of obamacare -lrb- which was ironically based on a massachusetts healthcare plan developed under romney -rrb- . obama 's campaign was based in chicago and run by many former members of the white house staff and members of the successful 2008 campaign . in october 2010 , prior to the elections in which republicans won control of the house , jonathan chait published an article in the new republic called `` scandal tbd '' where he predicted that if republicans were to win control of the house , and barack obama were to win re-election in 2012 , the republicans would try to impeach obama and use any reason possible as pretext .
the turkish team once again narrowly missed out on the world cup finals after failing to win a play-off , this time on away goals against switzerland , again after finishing second in their group . there were scenes of violence after the game on and off the pitch where the turkish team brawled with swiss players down the tunnel . a crowd estimated at more than 10,000 people marched silently on a bitterly cold day through downtown istanbul thursday to commemorate the five year anniversary of the murder of an ethnic armenian journalist hrant dink . they walked carrying a sea of black signs declaring `` we are all hrant , we are all armenian , '' written in turkish and armenian . police , who put the crowd estimate at 10,000 or more , blocked off traffic as the crowds moved towards the offices of the armenian language agos newspaper . on january 19 , 2007 , dink , the newspaper 's editor in chief , was gunned down in broad daylight on the sidewalk outside the newspaper 's offices . although turkey failed to qualify for the 1998 world cup , they qualified for euro 2000 after winning a play-off against the republic of ireland . turkey lost their first match 2 -- 1 to italy , they drew their second match against sweden 0 -- 0 , and beat host nation belgium 2 -- 0 , making it the first time in the history of the uefa european championship a host nation had been eliminated in the first round . this victory brought turkey into the last eight of the tournament , where they were beaten 2 -- 0 by portugal , with arif erdem missing a critical penalty .
james lott jr of afterbuzz tv said will 's murder was a `` jump the shark moment '' , and `` i just could n't believe it ! '' he said will was `` a character that has been on since pre-birth '' , and is `` related to almost everyone on the show '' , and `` i mean this is really ridiculous to me : to kill will horton ! '' lott described his experience watching it happen and thinking `` you 're ruining the show right now -- this is the biggest mistake you could have made , '' and `` as the life was coming out of him , the life was coming out of me at the same time , as a long-time viewer . '' lott 's afterbuzz tv colleague tony moore called will 's death `` gruesome '' and `` hard to watch '' , and bemoaned `` the whole gay storyline is just going to be done away with . '' he eventually left his seat on the chancery court , returning to his old law practice and farming his land . he continued with this life for some time , before being elected judge of the eighth circuit court , as noted above . it was during his second term that judge horton got the most important case of his career : the re-trials of the scottsboro boys . fire in the sky met with generally favorable reviews . john ferguson of the radio times wrote , `` lieberman wisely concentrates on the emotional impact of the event on a close-knit circle of friends and family , although the eventual revelation of the abduction is genuinely scary . db sweeney shines in the lead role and there 's good support . '' entertainment weekly journalist owen gleiberman suggested that `` it almost does n't matter if you do n't believe any of this stuff .
while before the genocide , rwandan history textbooks would acknowledge and highlight differences between tutsi and hutu people , today , the only government approved rwandan history textbook stresses the rwandans as one people and virtually ignore the ethnic differences and pre-genocide conflicts . furthermore , both many rwandan people and international scholars feel that the teaching of the genocide does not properly teach students the entire story of the genocide . in 2016 , rwanda introduced a curriculum that hoped to bring more balanced discussion to the topic of the genocide , however , the rwandan laws relating the `` divisionism '' and `` genocide ideology '' still limit the scope of such discussion . teachers are reported to fear the repercussions from discussing the genocide in a non-approved way and self-censor opinions under these rules . following an uprising by the ethnic tutsi , sometimes referred to as a whole as banyamulenge -lrb- although this term only represents people from one area in eastern zaire -- other ethnic tutsi kinyarwanda-speaking people include the banyamasisi and the banyarutshuru , as an example -rrb- people in eastern zaire in october 1997 , a huge movement of refugees began which brought more than 600,000 back to rwanda in the last two weeks of november . this massive repatriation was followed at the end of december 1996 by the return of another 500,000 from tanzania , again in a huge , spontaneous wave . less than 100,000 rwandans are estimated to remain outside of rwanda , and they are thought to be the remnants of the defeated army of the former genocidal government , its allies in the civilian militias known as interahamwe , and soldiers recruited in the refugee camps before 1996 . there are also many innocent hutu who remain in the forests of eastern congo , particularly rutshuru , masisi and bukavu , who have been misinformed by rebel forces that they will be killed upon return to rwanda . during president habyarimana 's years in power , france maintained very close relations with him , as part of its françafrique policy , and assisted rwanda militarily against the rpf during the civil war ; france considered the rpf , along with uganda , as part of a `` plot '' to increase anglophone influence at the expense of french influence . during the first few days of the genocide , france launched amaryllis , a military operation assisted by the belgian army and unamir , to evacuate expatriates from rwanda . the french and belgians refused to allow any tutsi to accompany them , and those who boarded the evacuation trucks were forced off at rwandan government checkpoints , where they were killed . the french also separated several expatriates and children from their tutsi spouses , rescuing the foreigners but leaving the rwandans to likely death .
in 1952 eva perón died at age 33 . she held the title of spiritual leader of the nation of argentina , granted by the congress of argentina . nearly three million people covered the funeral of evita in the streets of buenos aires . a radio broadcast interrupted the broadcasting schedule , with the announcer reading , `` the press secretary 's office of the presidency of the nation fulfills its very sad duty to inform the people of the republic that at 20:25 hours mrs. eva perón , spiritual leader of the nation , died .

the special is an episode featuring a route across india , one of the many countries top gear plans to visit over the course of the new series , according to jeremy clarkson . shooting in india began on 2 october , with the first leg of the shoot beginning in suburbs of mumbai . royce had always worked hard and was renowned for never eating proper meals which resulted in his being taken ill first in 1902 and again in 1911 . ill health had forced his move away from derby in 1912 . in the same year , he had a major operation in london and was given only a few months to live by the doctors . in spite of this he returned to work but was prevented from visiting the factory , which had moved to larger premises , fitted out to detailed plans by royce , in derby in 1908 . in 1850 , the british authorities bought the fort and castle belonging to the danish authorities . danish was no longer the lingua franca of christiansborg and the english-language salem school became the school of choice for the residents of the british colony . the school faced many challenging periods in the early years . the basel mission transferred alexander worthy clerk in 1849 to akropong to establish a similar salem school there .

for most of its history , nebraska has been a solidly republican state . republicans have carried the state in all but one presidential election since 1940 : the 1964 landslide election of lyndon b. johnson . in the 2004 presidential election , george w. bush won the state 's five electoral votes by a margin of 33 percentage points -lrb- making nebraska 's the fourth-strongest republican vote among states -rrb- with 65.9 % of the overall vote ; only thurston county , which is majority-native american , voted for his democratic challenger john kerry . in 2008 , the state split its electoral votes for the first time : republican john mccain won the popular vote in nebraska as a whole and two of its three congressional districts ; the second district , which includes the city of omaha , went for democrat barack obama . romero has three brothers . her mother was an educator and her father was a businessman . her parents encouraged romero and her siblings to be socially conscious and to be able to express their thoughts . as a result , her home was a home where `` conversations about poverty , the death penalty , the prevalence of homelessness , presidential elections and warfare were commonplace , as were talks about the importance of community and charity '' . romero , who is of mexican american descent , has an interest in the mexico-united states border . she has some experience with the border , as someone who had to go through a border checkpoint to visit her grandparents in san diego , california romero decided to write a trilogy that looks at the mexican/arizona border issues . two plays from the trilogy are wetback and mother of exiles . with the help of a grant from the national endowment of the arts , the arizona theatre company was able to commission romero to write the last play of her trilogy , as well as give the playwright the opportunity to lead a project called voices of a new america .
according to the lambda-cdm model , by this stage , the matter in the universe is around 84.5 % cold dark matter and 15.5 % `` ordinary '' matter . -lrb- however the total matter in the universe is only 31.7 % , much smaller than the 68.3 % of dark energy . -rrb- there is overwhelming evidence that dark matter exists and dominates our universe , but since the exact nature of dark matter is still not understood , the big bang theory does not presently cover any stages in its formation . at some time the stelliferous era will end as stars are no longer being born , and the expansion of the universe will mean that the observable universe becomes limited to local galaxies . there are various scenarios for the far future and ultimate fate of the universe . more exact knowledge of our current universe will allow these to be better understood . scientific understanding proceeds by fits and starts , with an occasional detour down a wrong path . however , today the world 's physicists have a real advance to celebrate . they have observed the most massive known fundamental subatomic particle directly interacting with an energy field that gives mass to the building blocks of the universe . this has never been done before and it gives increased insight into a phenomenon that was only discovered just a few short years ago .
evidence of the overlapping subject matter between the shows , as well as the conflict between them , arose when aaron sorkin asked lorne michaels to allow him to observe saturday night live for a week , a request michaels denied . despite this , sorkin sent fey flowers after nbc announced it would pick up both series , and wished her luck with 30 rock . fey said that `` it 's just bad luck for me that in my first attempt at prime time i 'm going up against the most powerful writer on television . i was joking that this would be the best pilot ever aired on trio . in 1979 sorkin attended syracuse university . in his freshman year he failed a class that was a core requirement -- a devastating setback because he wanted to be an actor , and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes . determined to do better , he returned in his sophomore year , and graduated in 1983 . recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher arthur storch , sorkin recalled , after storch 's death in march 2013 , that `` arthur 's reputation as a director , and as a disciple of lee strasberg , was a big reason why a lot of us went to s.u. . the west wing was honored with nine primetime emmy awards for its debut season , making the series a record holder for most emmys won by a series in a single season at the time . following the ceremony , a dispute arose regarding the acceptance speech for outstanding writing for a drama series . the west wing episode `` in excelsis deo '' won , which was awarded to sorkin and rick cleveland , while it was reported in a the new york times article that cleveland had been ushered off the stage by sorkin without being given a chance to say a few words . the story behind the west wing episode is based on cleveland 's father , a korean war veteran who spent the last years of his life on the street , as cleveland explains in his freshyarn.com essay titled `` i was the dumb looking guy with the wire-rimmed glasses '' .

the bear stearns companies , inc. was a new york-based global investment bank , securities trading and brokerage firm that failed in 2008 as part of the global financial crisis and recession , and was subsequently sold to jpmorgan chase . the company 's main business areas before its failure were capital markets , investment banking , wealth management , and global clearing services , and it was heavily involved in the subprime mortgage crisis . in the years leading up to the failure , bear stearns was heavily involved in securitization and issued large amounts of asset-backed securities which were , in the case of mortgages , pioneered by lewis ranieri , `` the father of mortgage securities '' . as investor losses mounted in those markets in 2006 and 2007 , the company actually increased its exposure , especially to the mortgage-backed assets that were central to the subprime mortgage crisis . at the end of 2007 , bear stearns was the fifth largest investment bank in the united states but its market capitalization had deteriorated through the second half of 2007 . on friday , march 14 , 2008 , bear stearns lost 47 % of its equity market value to close at $ 30.00 per share as rumors emerged that clients were withdrawing capital from the bank . over the following weekend , it emerged that bear stearns might prove insolvent , and on or around march 15 , 2008 , the federal reserve engineered a deal to prevent a wider systemic crisis from the collapse of bear stearns . in november 2009 , a week after birmingham , alabama mayor larry langford was convicted for financial crimes related to bond swaps for jefferson county , alabama , jpmorgan chase & co. agreed to a $ 722 million settlement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission to end a probe into the sales of derivatives that allegedly contributed to the near-bankruptcy of the county . jpmorgan had been chosen by the county commissioners to refinance the county 's sewer debt , and the sec had alleged that jpmorgan made undisclosed payments to close friends of the commissioners in exchange for the deal and made up for the costs by charging higher interest rates on the swaps .

as death succeeded death , dickinson found her world upended . in the fall of 1884 , she wrote that `` the dyings have been too deep for me , and before i could raise my heart from one , another has come . '' that summer she had seen `` a great darkness coming '' and fainted while baking in the kitchen . she remained unconscious late into the night and weeks of ill health followed . from the mid-1850s , emily 's mother became effectively bedridden with various chronic illnesses until her death in 1882 . writing to a friend in summer 1858 , emily said she would visit if she could leave `` home , or mother . i do not go out at all , lest father will come and miss me , or miss some little act , which i might forget , should i run away -- mother is much as usual . i know not what to hope of her '' . this highly nuanced and largely theatrical letter was unsigned , but she had included her name on a card and enclosed it in an envelope , along with four of her poems . he praised her work but suggested that she delay publishing until she had written longer , being unaware she had already appeared in print . she assured him that publishing was as foreign to her `` as firmament to fin '' , but also proposed that `` if fame belonged to me , i could not escape her '' . dickinson delighted in dramatic self-characterization and mystery in her letters to higginson .
in november 2011 , 60 minutes alleged that pelosi and several other members of congress had used information they gleaned from closed sessions to make money on the stock market . the program cited pelosi 's purchases of visa stock while a bill that would limit credit card fees was in the house . pelosi denied the allegations and called the report `` a right-wing smear '' . when the stop trading on congressional knowledge act -lrb- or stock act -rrb- was introduced the next year , pelosi voted for the bill and lauded its passing . in the 2006 midterm elections , the democrats won a majority in the house . nancy pelosi became speaker when the 110th congress convened on january 4 , 2007 , making her the first woman to hold the office . with the election of barack obama as president and democratic gains in both houses of congress , pelosi became the first speaker since tom foley to hold the office during single-party democratic leadership in washington . during the 111th congress , pelosi was the driving force behind several of obama 's major initiatives that proved controversial , and the republicans campaigned against the democrats ' legislation by staging a `` fire pelosi '' bus tour and regained control of the house in the 2010 midterm elections . in the 2018 midterm elections , the democrats regained a majority of seats in the house . on november 28 , house democrats nominated pelosi to once again serve as speaker of the house . she was formally re-elected to the speakership at the start of the 116th congress on january 3 , 2019 . pelosi `` clinched the speakership after weeks of whittling down opposition from some fellow democrats seeking a new generation of leadership .
the 1996 presidential election , despite ending in a loss , opened up numerous opportunities for dole owing in part to his sense of humor . he has engaged in a career of writing , consulting , public speaking , and television appearances . dole was the first defeated presidential nominee to become a political celebrity . dole eventually won the nomination , becoming the oldest first-time presidential nominee at the age of 73 years , 1 month -lrb- president ronald reagan was 73 years , 6 months in 1984 , for his second presidential nomination -rrb- , and would 've succeeded reagan as the oldest president to take office , as well as the first kansas native to become president -lrb- as dwight eisenhower was born in texas -rrb- . dole found the initial draft of the acceptance speech written by mark helprin too hardline , so kerry tymchuk who was part of the '' ` let dole be dole ' crowd '' revised the speech to cover the ` themes of honor , decency and straight talk . it included the following line , a swat at the all-or-nothing rookie republicans who had been swept into congress in the 1994 midterm gop wave : `` in politics honorable compromise is no sin . it is what protects us from absolutism and intolerance '' ' . going into the 1996 primary contest , senate majority leader bob dole was widely seen as the front runner . dole had significant name recognition , as he was a two time presidential candidate - in 1980 and 1988 , and republican vice-presidential nominee in 1976 . he was expected to win the nomination against underdog candidates such as the more conservative u.s. senator phil gramm of texas and more centrist u.s.
the boston globe called for a nationwide refutation of trump 's `` dirty war '' against the news media , with the hashtag #enemyofnone . more than 300 news outlets joined the campaign . the new york times called trump 's attacks `` dangerous to the lifeblood of democracy '' and published excerpts from dozens of further publications . the new york post wrote , `` it may be frustrating to argue that just because we print inconvenient truths does n't mean that we 're fake news , but being a journalist is n't a popularity contest . the president engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his presidential reelection , to harm the election prospects of a political rival , and to influence our nation 's upcoming presidential election to his advantage . in doing so , the president placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the united states , sought to undermine the integrity of the u.s. presidential election process , and endangered u.s. national security . throughout his 2016 presidential campaign and his presidency , trump has repeatedly accused the press of intentionally misinterpreting his words and of being biased , calling them `` fake news media '' and `` the enemy of the people '' . in the campaign , trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage , elevating his standing in the republican primaries . new york times writer amy chozick wrote in september 2018 that one of the reasons for trump 's appeal was his media dominance . to answer the question of why the u.s. public could not stop being enthralled by his actions , she wrote `` even in the so-called golden age of tv , mr. trump has n't just dominated water-cooler conversation ; he 's sucked the water right out , making all other entertainment from n.f.l.

often larry dunne could not meet the demand for heroin , so many others got involved , but larry was still considered the main source . one was tony `` king scum '' felloni , once in the prostitution business , he would move into the drug-trade . overall there was mutual respect , and practically no conflict between crime families and drug king-pins , around the 1980s . dunne wrote more than 700 dooley pieces , about a third of which were printed in eight books . their era of influence ended with the start of world war i . after dooley became popular , dunne left chicago and lived in new york , where he wrote books and articles and edited the american magazine , metropolitan magazine and collier 's weekly , becoming a beloved figure in club and literary circles . six months at the tribune saw dunne gain promotion to editor of the sunday edition , soon after the start of 1890 . this relieved him of the drudgery of the daily reporter 's beat , which he disliked . before the end of the year , he moved again , this time to the chicago herald -- publisher john r. walsh and editor james w. scott were building a staff composed mainly of enthusiastic younger journalists , including dunne 's old colleague from the ballpark , seymour . several whitechapel members were there , as was future politician brand whitlock , who later wrote , `` when they induced ` pete ' dunne to come over from the tribune , the staff seemed complete '' .
it is unknown to what extent the agency 's recommendations were used or for how long , but according to the same senate report , the list drawn up by dia included the use of `` drugs such as sodium pentothal and demerol '' , humiliation via female interrogators and sleep deprivation . becker claimed that he recommended the use of drugs due to rumors that another intelligence agency , the name of which was redacted in the senate report , had successfully used them in the past . according to the analysis of the office of defense inspector general , dia 's cited justification for the use of drugs was to '' detainee to cooperative state '' and that mind-altering substances were not used . since the september 11 attacks , dia has been active in nuclear proliferation intelligence collection and analysis with particular interests in north korea and iran as well as counter-terrorism . dia was also involved with the intelligence build-up to the invasion of iraq in 2003 and was a subject in the senate report of pre-war intelligence on iraq . after the invasion , dia led the iraq survey group to find the alleged weapons of mass destruction . the agency has conflicted with the cia in collection and analysis on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq and has often represented the pentagon in the cia -- dod intelligence rivalry due to dia 's own clandestine humint collection . the director of the defense intelligence agency is an intelligence officer who , upon nomination by the president and confirmation by the senate , serves as the nation 's highest-ranking military intelligence officer . he or she is the primary intelligence adviser to the secretary of defense and also answers to the director of national intelligence . the director is also the commander of the joint functional component command for intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance , a subordinate command of united states strategic command , which is headquartered in omaha , nebraska . additionally , he or she chairs the military intelligence board , which coordinates activities of the entire defense intelligence community .
when the court is in session , the great hall is not open to the public , except for those attending court . the arguments are typically held in two-week cycles of a 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. argument on mondays , tuesdays , and wednesdays . depending on the significance of the case and the time of year -lrb- winter arguments are less popular -rrb- , visitors should arrive at the court anywhere from two hours in advance to , in extremely controversial cases , the night before . at some point in the morning , which is not predetermined , the supreme court police officers distribute numbered tickets . from 1860 to 1935 , the supreme court justices were designated to conduct their work within the cramped space of the old senate chamber alongside other federal government employees . this environment discouraged the supreme court justices from travelling to washington , so they conducted most of their work from their homes . before the supreme court building was approved , charles evans hughes , who had been an associate justice from 1910 to 1914 , was vocally outspoken about the poor conditions of the justices 's working environment and described the old senate chamber as small , overheated , and barren . through the rigorous lobbying efforts of chief justice taft , he was able to secure the funding needed from congress for a supreme court building in 1929 . chief justice white was part of the initial resistance to the idea of a supreme court building . he argued that the supreme court obtained its relevance because of its location within the capitol . many justices in addition to justice white refused to conduct their work within the building , and remained in their homes . the familiarity of their work spaces at home naturally discouraged the justices from operating in a completely new location , and they were also given funding by congress to work from their homes .

when president donald trump and first lady melania trump arrived on the white house south lawn tuesday morning to formally welcome french president emmanuel macron and his wife , brigitte , one thing was clear : the first lady commanded attention . without speaking a word , dressed in a white michael kors collection asymmetrical blazer and skirt -- and an eye-catching , custom-made hervé pierre hat -- melania trump spoke volumes . this was her house , her dinner and her terms . it has truly been a spotlight week for the first lady , kicking off with her attendance at barbara bush 's funeral , the sole white house representation joining other first ladies and former presidents and culminating with her first state dinner . during the el paso shooting in texas on august 3 , 2019 , a lone gunman killed 22 people and injured 24 others . melania and president trump visited the hospital where eight of the survivors were being cared for . the president and first lady met with the families of survivors , hospital staff and first responders , and posed with a baby who had been orphaned when both of his parents were killed . the white house had asked that the child be brought in and he was accompanied by his uncle . president trump spoke for nearly two hours at a rally in michigan . meanwhile , back in washington , dc , journalists are gathering for the annual dinner that celebrates the first amendment -- an event that previous presidents attended yearly . president trump , speaking his rally , took a jab at the white house correspondents ' dinner he 's missing back in washington . `` by the way , is this better than that phony washington white house correspondents ' dinner ?
during a tailgate for a chicago bears game , casey and other first responders help a man who has a flesh eating bacteria on his leg . soon after , four more victims come down with the same symptoms leading to a massive outbreak . later on , 51 responds to a call at a university that specializes in biological research . the team comes to the conclusion that the case was arson . fichtner was cast as alexander mahone one day before filming began for the second season . after acting the previous year in the series invasion , fichtner did not intend to return to network television . when approached with the scripts for the first two episodes of the second season fichtner was uncertain of his character 's background , but attracted to `` the potential of who this guy is . '' fichtner was given two days to decide whether he wanted to play the character and , although he was unsure if the experience would be worthwhile , he later said that he was glad to have accepted the role . fichtner said that his role on prison break ended up being `` a lot longer '' than he had originally thought . he was signed on to appear for a further two seasons , after being convinced by olmstead to appear in a fourth -lrb- and final -rrb- one . the series ' move from dallas to los angeles for filming was also an inducement for fichtner , who previously had to leave his family for filming . when olmstead asked fichtner to return for the fourth season , his only request was to make it challenging by making his character 's journey difficult .
in 1991 , irwin met terri raines , an american naturalist from eugene , oregon , who was visiting wildlife rehabilitation facilities in australia and had decided to visit the zoo . according to the couple , it was love at first sight . terri said at the time , `` i thought there was no one like this anywhere in the world . he sounded like an environmental tarzan , a larger-than-life superhero guy . '' considered by many literary experts as the first english novel , pamela was the best-seller of its time . it was read by countless buyers of the novel and was also read in groups . an anecdote which has been repeated in varying forms since 1777 described the novel 's reception in an english village : `` the blacksmith of the village had got hold of richardson 's novel of pamela , or virtue rewarded , and used to read it aloud in the long summer evenings , seated on his anvil , and never failed to have a large and attentive audience ... . at length , when the happy turn of fortune arrived , which brings the hero and heroine together , and sets them living long and happily ... the congregation were so delighted as to raise a great shout , and procuring the church keys , actually set the parish bells ringing . '' in the weeks following irwin 's death , at least ten stingrays were found dead and mutilated on the beaches of queensland , with their tails cut off , prompting speculation as to whether they might have been killed by fans of irwin as an act of revenge , although , according to the chairman of the queensland fishing information service , anglers regularly cut the tails off of accidentally caught stingrays to avoid being stung . michael hornby , a friend of irwin and executive director of his wildlife warrior fund , condemned any revenge killings , saying that `` we just want to make it very clear that we will not accept and not stand for anyone who 's taken a form of retribution . that 's the last thing steve would want . ''
skarsgård was brought up by humanist , atheist parents , and had an atheist grandfather and a deeply religious grandmother . according to skarsgård , this never led to any problems because of the family 's mutual respect for each other 's opinions . after the september 11 attacks , skarsgård set out to read the bible and the quran , both of which he condemns as violent . skarsgård is also a critic of religious independent schools in the swedish educational system . jones quickly became embroiled in controversy when he attempted to hire his longtime friend and former baylor university coach art briles as an assistant . briles had been fired from baylor for his actions in connection with a major sexual assault scandal at the school . following a media firestorm , the team reversed the decision to hire briles . frustrated with what he viewed as a lack of support from the university , jones opted to leave hawaii at the end of the 2007 season . after initial reports had him interviewing at smu , hawaii officials had offers to raise his salary from $ 800,000 a year to $ 1.7 million a year and offered a commitment to improve its facilities ; in addition there was an outpouring of support from hawaii fans , including gov. linda lingle . however , jones contacted hawaii on january 7 , 2008 and let them know he had decided to accept an offer from smu .
it was n't until recently that bilingualism had been accepted as a contributing factor to cognitive development . there have been a number of studies showing how bilingualism contributes to the executive function of the brain , which is the main center at which cognitive development happens . according to bialystok in `` bilingualism and the development of executive function : the role of attention '' , children who are bilingual , have to actively filter through the two different languages to select the one they need to use , which in turn makes the development stronger in that center . the origin of the discipline of developmental cognitive neuroscience can be traced back to conference held in philadelphia in 1989 co-funded by nichd & nimh , organized by adele diamond , that started the process of developmental psychologists , cognitive scientists , and neuroscientists talking with one another . to bridge the communication gaps , researchers were invited from different fields who were either using the same experimental paradigms to study the same behaviors or were investigating related scientific questions in complementary ways -- though they were unaware of one another 's work . they used different words to talk about their work and had different ways of thinking about it , but the concrete , observable behaviors , and the precise experimental conditions under which those behaviors occurred , served to make translation possible . participants were a small who 's who of leaders in developmental science , behavioral neuroscience , and cognitive science . philosophers have always been interested in the mind : `` the idea that explaining a phenomenon involves understanding the mechanism responsible for it has deep roots in the history of philosophy from atomic theories in 5th century b.c. to its rebirth in the 17th and 18th century in the works of galileo , descartes , and boyle . among others , it 's descartes ' idea that machines humans build could work as models of scientific explanation . '' for example , aristotle thought the brain was the body 's cooling system and the capacity for intelligence was located in the heart .
university of california , irvine had in mark poster one of the first and foremost theorists of media culture in the us , and can boast a strong department of film & media studies . university of california , berkeley has three institutional structures within which media studies can take place : the department of film and media -lrb- formerly film studies program -rrb- , including famous theorists as mary ann doane and linda williams , the center for new media , and a long established interdisciplinary program formerly titled mass communications , which recently changed its name to media studies , dropping any connotations which accompany the term `` mass '' in the former title . until recently , radford university in virginia used the title `` media studies '' for a department that taught practitioner-oriented major concentrations in journalism , advertising , broadcast production and web design . in 2008 , those programs were combined with a previous department of communication -lrb- speech and public relations -rrb- to create a school of communication . in his book `` understanding media , the extensions of man '' , media theorist marshall mcluhan suggested that `` the medium is the message '' , and that all human artefacts and technologies are media . his book introduced the usage of terms such as `` media '' into our language along with other precepts , among them `` global village '' and `` age of information '' . a medium is anything that mediates our interaction with the world or other humans . given this perspective , media study is not restricted to just media of communications but all forms of technology . media monitor was the bi-monthly publication of the center for media and public affairs , which presented the central findings of one or more research studies on media monitoring . it was started in 1987 and last published in 2010 . it was a concise analysis of contemporary media coverage and the controversies that surround it . the research published was the result of quantitative content analysis of television , print , and radio news .
by 2008 , ea had started altering its practices , in part due to the appointment of a new ceo , john riccitiello . riccitiello acknowledged in 2008 that the company 's prior practices towards acquisition was wrong and that the company now gave acquired studios greater autonomy without `` meddling '' in their corporate culture . the company 's cfo blake jorgensen similarly acknowledged this prior practice was `` somewhat marginal in performance '' in a statement in 2014 , and that going forward , the company would likely slow down on acquisitions and giving the opportunity for their internal studios to help produce major titles instead . this sentiment was echoed by those that had worked in ea in the past and present . it was revealed in february 2008 that electronic arts had made a takeover bid for rival game company take-two interactive . after its initial offer of us$ 25 per share , all cash stock transaction offer was rejected by the take-two board , ea revised it to us$ 26 per share , a 64 % premium over the previous day 's closing price and made the offer known to the public . rumours had been floating around the internet prior to the offer about take-two possibly being bought over by a bigger company , albeit with viacom as the potential bidder . in may 2008 , ea announced that it will purchase the assets of hands-on mobile korea , a south korean mobile game developer and publisher . ea had also received criticism for developing games that lack innovation vis-à-vis the number of gaming titles produced under the ea brand that show a history of yearly updates , particularly in their sporting franchises . these typically retail as new games at full market price and feature only updated team rosters in addition to incremental changes to game mechanics , the user interface , and graphics . one critique compared ea to companies like ubisoft and concluded that ea 's innovation in new and old ips `` crawls along at a snail 's pace , '' while even the company 's own ceo , john riccitiello , acknowledged the lack of innovation seen in the industry generally , saying , `` we 're boring people to death and making games that are harder and harder to play . for the most part , the industry has been rinse-and-repeat .
during the presidency of george w. bush , several american politicians sought to either investigate bush for possible impeachable offenses , or to bring actual impeachment charges on the floor of the united states house of representatives judiciary committee . the most significant of these efforts occurred on june 10 , 2008 , when congressman dennis kucinich , along with co-sponsor robert wexler , introduced 35 articles of impeachment against bush to the u.s. house of representatives . the house voted 251 to 166 to refer the impeachment resolution to the judiciary committee on june 11 , where no further action was taken on it . bush 's presidency ended on january 20 , 2009 , with the completion of his second term in office , rendering impeachment efforts moot . debate , like most other matters governing the internal functioning of the senate , is governed by internal rules adopted by the senate . during debate , senators may only speak if called upon by the presiding officer , but the presiding officer is required to recognize the first senator who rises to speak . thus , the presiding officer has little control over the course of debate . customarily , the majority leader and minority leader are accorded priority during debates even if another senator rises first . the presidency of george w. bush began at noon est on january 20 , 2001 , when george w. bush was inaugurated as the 43rd president of the united states , and ended on january 20 , 2009 . bush , a republican , took office following a very close victory over democratic incumbent vice president al gore in the 2000 presidential election . four years later , in the 2004 election , he defeated democrat john kerry to win re-election . bush , the 43rd president , is the eldest son of the 41st president , george h. w. bush .

the historian james oakes in 1982 stated that `` he evidence is overwhelming that the vast majority of black slaveholders were free men who purchased members of their families or who acted out of benevolence '' . after 1810 southern states made it increasingly difficult for any slaveholders to free slaves . often the purchasers of family members were left with no choice but to maintain , on paper , the owner -- slave relationship . in the 1850s `` there were increasing efforts to restrict the right to hold bondsmen on the grounds that slaves should be kept ` as far as possible under the control of white men only . ' '' i fear that we may be on the verge of becoming an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control not just the economy , but the political life of this country . and that 's just something we 're going to have wrestle with . jones saw jonestown as both a `` socialist paradise '' and a `` sanctuary '' from media scrutiny that had started with the kinsolving articles . former temple member tim carter said the temple moved to jonestown because `` in ' 74 , what we saw in the united states was creeping fascism . '' carter explained , `` it was apparent that corporations , or the multinationals , were getting much larger , their influence was growing within the government , and the united states is a racist place . '' carter said the temple concluded that guyana was `` a place in a black country where our black members could live in peace '' , `` it was a socialist government '' and it was `` the only english-speaking country in south america . ''
the story of the jews in the united states is a testament to `` american exceptionalism '' and stands in contrast to a long history of discrimination and pariah status in europe and muslim lands . in fact , the economic prosperity and social standing of america 's jews shows that generally they have fared better than many other minorities . this positive record is a fulfillment of the assurance given to the newport , rhode island , hebrew congregation in 1790 by president george washington : `` it is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it were the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights , for , happily , the government of the united states ... gives to bigotry no sanction , to persecution no assistance . '' since then , american jews have been appointed and elected to public offices as governors , senators , mayors , cabinet officers and in the military , and today , most american adults are unaware of and do n't seem to care who 's jewish . in 1981 , the population of african americans at princeton university made up less than 10 % . bruce m. wright was admitted into the university in 1936 as the first african american , however , his admission was a mistake and when he got to campus he was asked to leave . three years later wright asked the dean for an explanation on his dismissal and the dean suggested to him that `` a member of your race might feel very much alone '' at princeton university . the battle over the confirmation of loretta lynch heated up wednesday as a top senate democrat accused republican leadership of treating the would-be first african-american woman attorney general like a second-class citizen . the charge was a response to majority leader mitch mcconnell 's vow to delay a vote on lynch until the senate completes consideration of an unrelated bill to fight human trafficking -- legislation that had broad bipartisan support until democrats discovered it contained an anti-abortion provision . read : standoff over ag nominee loretta lynch democrats like illinois sen. dick durbin argue lynch 's nomination has nothing to do with the trafficking bill and are demanding an immediate vote . `` the republican majority leader announced over the weekend that he was going to hold this nomination of loretta lynch until the bill , which is pending before the senate passes , whenever that may be , '' durbin said on the senate floor .
president of the united states , donald trump , threatened to raise tariffs on mexico if it did not help to curb migration to the united states . in early june 2019 , as part of a deal the united states , mexico agreed to deploy the newly formed national guard to their border with guatemala . while the guard was always intended to enforce immigration policy , it was not intended to do so as soon as announced . house speaker john boehner faces a looming threat from conservatives to oust him as speaker , and it 's tying his hands on funding the department of homeland security . congress passed a one-week extension of funding just hours before the deadline on friday night . it was that fear fueling boehner 's resistance to a longer-term bill , as it might prompt backlash from conservatives . president barack obama signed the bill , which funds the department of homeland security through friday . house speaker john boehner had a message for reporters who want to know what he 's going to do to keep the department of homeland security : pucker up . after batting away question after question about what the house will do if the senate sends it a bill to fund homeland security , without including in it the attack on president barack obama 's immigration actions that conservatives are seeking , the ohio republican responded to one by puckering his lips and making kissing noises in the reporter 's direction . it was no valentine from boehner , who was suggesting that capitol hill reporters were n't going to get any more out of him . `` when we make decisions , we 'll let you know , '' boehner said .
the real heroes program used videos , photo albums and blogs on the real heroes website to depict the lives of nine u.s. army , reserve , and national guard soldiers featured in the program . soldiers ' likenesses and biographies were incorporated into america 's army game and used to create action figures sold at retail stores and distributed at army events . additionally , those featured in the real heroes program made media appearances at america 's army events across the country , such as the virtual army experience , gaming competitions and technology education programs . on january 23 , 2007 , real hero sergeant tommy rieman was recognized by president george w. bush during his state of the union address . eight days after the allied invasion of mainland italy , on 18 september 1943 , the 3rd division came ashore at salerno , where they came under the command of vi corps , under major general ernest j. dawley who was replaced two days later by major general john p. lucas -lrb- who had commanded the division from september 1941 to march 1942 -rrb- . the corps was part of lieutenant general mark w. clark 's u.s. fifth army . the 3rd division was destined to see some of the fiercest and toughest fighting of the war thus far , serving on the italian front . seeing intensive action along the way , the division drove to and across the volturno river by october 1943 , and then to monte cassino , where the battle of monte cassino would later be fought , before , with the rest of the 15th army group , being held up at the winter line -lrb- also known as the gustav line -rrb- . finally , after months of training the division moved to the line of departure , alongside the 1st armored division on its left flank and the 2d armored cavalry regiment on its right flank . while the iraqi army concentrated much of its defenses in and around kuwait itself , the 3d ad and vii corps launched a massive armored attack into iraq , just to the west of kuwait , taking the iraqis completely by surprise .
during the 1970s and early 1980s , the majority of npr funding came from the federal government . steps were taken during the reagan administration in the 1980s to completely wean npr from government support , but the 1983 funding crisis forced the network to make immediate changes . according to cpb , in 2009 11.3 % of the aggregate revenues of all public radio broadcasting stations were funded from federal sources , principally through cpb ; in 2012 10.9 % of the revenues for public radio came from federal sources . in late january 2020 , the labour-led coalition government announced that they were planning to merge tvnz and radio new zealand to create a new public broadcasting service . in response , the opposition national party announced that it would oppose any plans to merge radio nz and tvnz . public television and radio in the u.s. has , from the late 1960s onward , dealt with severe criticism from conservative politicians and think-tanks -lrb- such as the heritage foundation -rrb- , which allege that its programming has a leftist bias and there have been successful attempts to reduce -- though not eliminate -- funding for public television stations by some state legislatures .
the sunday league was launched in 1969 , as the second one-day competition in england and wales alongside the gillette cup -lrb- launched in 1963 -rrb- . sponsored by john player & sons , the league was called john player 's county league -lrb- 1969 -rrb- , the john player league -lrb- 1970 -- 83 -rrb- , then the john player special league -lrb- 1984 -- 86 -rrb- . the 17 counties of the time played each other in a league format on sunday afternoons throughout the season . these matches were concise enough to be shown on television , with bbc2 broadcasting one match each week in full until the 1980s , and then as part of the sunday grandstand multi-sport programme . saint john the baptist church -lrb- armenian : սուրբ հովհաննես մկրտիչ եկեղեցի , surp hovhannes mkrtich -rrb- is an active church in the old area of kond , yerevan , armenia . first , it was built on the height of kond district , in 1710 , in the place of a medieval church ruined as the result of a destructive earthquake . it was built by a rich man , melik aghamal , living in yerevan . like the other medieval churches , this is a three-nave basilic church . st. john the baptist church is an abandoned and ruined church presently located within the seepz industrial area , in andheri , mumbai , india . it was built by the portuguese jesuits in 1579 and opened to public worship on the feast of john the baptist that year . it also had an attached graveyard . the church was abandoned in 1840 after an epidemic hit the village .
the only loss on the year was the first to rival south carolina since 1896 . `` the carolina fans that week were carrying around a poster with the image of a tiger with a gamecock standing on top of it , holding the tiger 's tail as if he was steering the tiger by the tail , '' jay mccormick said . `` naturally , the clemson guys did n't take too kindly to that , and on wednesday and again on thursday , there were sporadic fistfights involving brass knuckles and other objects and so forth , some of which resulted , according to the newspapers , in blood being spilled and persons having to seek medical assistance . after the game on thursday , the clemson guys frankly told the carolina students that if you bring this poster , which is insulting to us , to the big parade on friday , you 're going to be in trouble . the democrats returned to power in 1877 following their decisive electoral victory over the radical republicans and promptly proceeded to close the university . sentiment in the state favored opening an agriculture college , so the university was reorganized as the south carolina college of agriculture and mechanic arts . in 1882 , the college was renamed to its antebellum name , south carolina college , which infuriated the farmers who felt that the politicians had frustrated the will of the people by de-emphasizing agriculture education , even though the school still retained the department of agriculture . clemson , from its beginning , was an all-white male military school . tigervision , clemson 's student-run tv station , broadcasts on channel 88 on the university 's campus cable network . the station was created in 1994 under the name clemson cable network by students at wsbf-fm who were interested in television production . the station aired a variety of student created content as well as recently released movies via a licensing agreement . by 2006 , after experiencing a decline in membership and viewers , ccn was no longer consistently producing content and fell into relative obscurity .
the reason for clark 's impact on popular culture was partly explained by paul anka , a singer who appeared on the show early in his career : `` this was a time when there was no youth culture -- he created it . and the impact of the show on people was enormous . '' in 1990 , a few years after the show had been off the air , clark considered his personal contribution to the music he helped introduce : clark then launched his own radio syndication group with partners nick verbitsky and ed salamon called the united stations radio network . that company later merged with the transtar network to become unistar , and took over the countdown program countdown america . the program ran until 1994 , when unistar was sold to westwood one radio . the following year , clark and verbitsky started over with a new version of the usrn , bringing into the fold dick clark 's rock , roll & remember , written and produced by pam miller -lrb- who also came up with the line used in the show and later around the world : `` the soundtrack of our lives '' -rrb- , and a new countdown show : the u.s. music survey , produced by jim zoller . the only person to ever co-host the show with dick clark was donna summer , who joined him to present a special episode dedicated to the release of the casablanca film thank god it 's friday on may 27 , 1978 . from the late 1950s and most of the 1960s , clark 's on-camera sidekick was announcer charlie o'donnell , who later went on to announce wheel of fortune and other programs hosted or produced by clark , such as the $ 100,000 pyramid . during this time , there were occasionally shows that were not hosted by clark , in which case a substitute host -lrb- among them being rick azar -rrb- would be brought in to host in clark 's stead .
unfortunately , being james bond meant surrendering his own sense of self , and he walked away from the fame and fortune that would 've come with the role , settled back in australia , and became a realtor where he married , raised a family , and led a happy and normal life . in 1938 , refugee peter vadassy -lrb- james mason -rrb- decides to take a vacation at the hotel reserve to celebrate both his completion of medical school and his impending french citizenship . when he goes to pick up some photographs at the local pharmacy , he is taken away and questioned by michel beghin -lrb- julien mitchell -rrb- of french naval intelligence . when his negatives had been developed , some of them turned out to be of french military installations . it is discovered that while the camera is the same make as peter 's , the serial number is different . becoming bond is an american documentary drama film that premiered on hulu on may 5 , 2017 . directed , written and produced by josh greenbaum , it explores the casting of australian model george lazenby as james bond in the film on her majesty 's secret service , his eventual decision to leave the role , and the effect it all had on his career and the rest of his life . the film employs the use of re-enacted dramatizations of lazenby 's life interspersed with actual interview footage of him .
greenwich mean time -lrb- gmt -rrb- is a term originally referring to mean solar time at the royal observatory , greenwich in greenwich . it is commonly used in practice to refer to coordinated universal time -lrb- utc -rrb- when this is viewed as a time zone , especially by bodies connected with the united kingdom , such as the bbc world service , the royal navy , the met office and others , although strictly utc is an atomic time scale which only approximates gmt with a tolerance of 0.9 second . it is also used to refer to universal time -lrb- ut -rrb- , which is a standard astronomical concept used in many technical fields and is referred to by the phrase zulu time . bloomberg business reported on june 2 , 2015 , that news corp and 21st century fox , both owned by rupert murdoch , had signed a non-binding agreement with the port authority of new york and new jersey to create a joint headquarters at two world trade center . silverstein said , `` a decision by 21st century fox and news corp. to move to the new world trade center would cap a seismic shift that has taken place in lower manhattan over the past decade . this is n't your grandfather 's wall street .

in the british punch and judy show , punch speaks in a distinctive squawking voice , produced by a contrivance known as a swazzle or swatchel which the professor holds in his mouth , transmitting his gleeful cackle . this gives punch a vocal quality as though he were speaking through a kazoo . joan 's name was changed to judy because `` judy '' was easier to enunciate with the swazzle than `` joan '' . so important is punch 's signature sound that it is a matter of some controversy within punch and judy circles as to whether a `` non-swazzled '' show can be considered a true punch and judy show . the term punch refers to a wide assortment of drinks , both non-alcoholic and alcoholic , generally containing fruit or fruit juice . the drink was introduced from india to the united kingdom in the early seventeenth century , and from there its use spread to other countries . punch is usually served at parties in large , wide bowls , known as punch bowls . in the u.s. , federal regulations provide the word `` punch '' to describe commercial beverage products that do not contain fruit or fruit juice . the webcomic version of one-punch man was created by one in 2009 . he became interested in creating a comic superhero who was already the strongest in the world . he wanted to focus on different aspects of storytelling than those normally relied on in standard superhero stories , such as everyday problems . one said , `` punching is oftentimes pretty useless against life 's problems .
according to kahia , `` the film itself is ultimately an exploration of obsession and attachment , and of how an unhealthy obsession can lead to a person 's downfall . as human beings , we can become very attached to any number of things , whether it be a person , a thing , or even an ideal ... and when things do not go our way in life , we can have a hard time letting go , especially when it comes to other people .

the supreme court of the united states -lrb- scotus -rrb- is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the united states . it has ultimate -lrb- and largely discretionary -rrb- appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law , and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases , specifically `` all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party '' . the court holds the power of judicial review , the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the u.s. constitution . it is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the constitution or statutory law . in theory , state supreme courts are bound by the precedent established by the u.s. supreme court as to all issues of federal law , but in practice , the supreme court reviews very few decisions from state courts . for example , in 2007 the court reviewed 244 cases appealed from federal courts and only 22 from state courts . despite the relatively small number of decisions reviewed , professors sara benesh and wendy martinek found that state supreme courts follow precedent more closely than federal courts in the area of search and seizure and appear to follow precedent in confessions as well . one of the informal traditions of the american legal system , derived from the common law , is that all litigants are guaranteed at least one appeal after a final judgment on the merits . however , appeal is merely a privilege provided by statute in 47 states and in federal judicial proceedings ; the u.s. supreme court has repeatedly ruled that there is no federal constitutional right to an appeal .

these years were marked by growth in the power of political parties . the watershed event was the civil war which resolved the slavery issue and unified the nation under federal authority , but weakened the power of states ' rights . the gilded age -lrb- 1877 -- 1901 -rrb- was marked by republican dominance of congress . during this time , lobbying activity became more intense , particularly during the administration of president ulysses s. grant in which influential lobbies advocated for railroad subsidies and tariffs on wool . the term congress can also refer to a particular meeting of the legislature . a congress covers two years ; the current one , the 116th congress , began on january 3 , 2019 , and will end on january 3 , 2021 . the congress starts and ends on the third day of january of every odd-numbered year . members of the senate are referred to as senators ; members of the house of representatives are referred to as representatives , congresswomen , or congressmen . each territory and washington , d.c. , elect a non-voting delegate to the u.s. house of representatives as they have throughout congressional history . they `` possess the same powers as other members of the house , except that they may not vote when the house is meeting as the house of representatives .

senate judiciary chairman chuck grassley says he has yet to hear back from christine blasey ford , the woman who has accused supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh of committing sexual and physical assault while they were both in high school . tuesday morning , grassley told hugh hewitt on his radio show that ford has not accepted his request to appear before the committee . `` we have reached out to her in the last 36 hours , three or four times , by email , and we have not heard from them , '' grassley said . `` so it kind of raises the question , do they want to come to the public hearing or not ?

later in his career , dickens ' fame and the demand for his public readings were unparalleled . in 1868 the times wrote , `` amid all the variety of ` readings ' , those of mr charles dickens stand alone . '' a dickens biographer , edgar johnson , wrote in the 1950s : `` it was more than a reading ; it was an extraordinary exhibition of acting that seized upon its auditors with a mesmeric possession . '' comparing his reception to a pop star , the guardian states , `` people sometimes fainted at his shows . his performances even saw the rise of that modern phenomenon , the `` speculator '' or ticket tout -- the ones in new york city escaped detection by borrowing respectable-looking hats from the waiters in nearby restaurants . '' during the filming of the 2008 canadian documentary passage , gerald dickens , charles ' great-great grandson was introduced to explain `` why such a great champion of the underdog had sided with the establishment '' . dickens ' insult of the inuit was a hurt they carried from generation to generation , tagak curley an inuit statesman said to gerald , `` your grandfather insulted my people . we have had to live with the pain of this for 150 years . this really harmed my people and is still harming them '' . joel berkowitz reports that the earliest stage adaptations of oliver twist `` followed by an almost unrelieved procession of jewish stage distortions , and even helped to popularize a lisp for stage jewish characters that lasted until 1914 '' it is widely believed that the most antisemitic adaptation of oliver twist is david lean 's film of 1948 , with alec guinness as fagin . guinness was made-up to look like the illustrations from the novel 's first edition . the film 's release in the us was much delayed , due to jewish protests , and was initially released with several of fagin 's scenes cut . this particular adaptation of the novel was banned in israel .
in 2011 , a feature story in the norwegian newspaper aftenposten contended that major criticisms of the award were that the norwegian nobel committee ought to recruit members from professional and international backgrounds , rather than retired members of parliament ; that there is too little openness about the criteria that the committee uses when they choose a recipient of the prize ; and that the adherence to nobel 's will should be more strict . in the article , norwegian historian øivind stenersen argues that norway has been able to use the prize as an instrument for nation building and furthering norway 's foreign policy and economic interests . it said that `` al gore has for a long time been one of the world 's leading environmentalist politicians '' , and described him as `` probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted . '' in conclusion , it said the nobel committee was `` seeking to contribute to a sharper focus on the processes and decisions that appear to be necessary to protect the world 's future climate , and thereby to reduce the threat to the security of mankind . action is necessary now , before climate change moves beyond man 's control . '' the nobel peace prize was awarded friday to india 's kailash satyarthi and pakistan 's malala yousafzai for their struggles against the suppression of children and for young people 's rights , including the right to education . thorbjorn jagland , chairman of the norwegian nobel committee , said , `` children must go to school , not be financially exploited .

though the role of a single mother is similar to the role of a married mother , to take care of household responsibilities and work a full-time job , the single mothers ' responsibility is greater since she does not have a second party income that a partner would provide for her family members . according to brown , this lack of a second party income has resulted in the majority of african american children raised in single mother households having a poor upbringing . there are several hypotheses -- both social and economic -- explaining the persistence of the current african-american family structure . some researchers theorize that the low economic statuses of the newly freed slaves in 1850 led to the current family structure for african americans . these researchers suggest that extreme poverty has increased the destabilization of african american families while others point to high female labor participation , few job opportunities for black males , and small differences between wages for men and women that have decreased marriage stability for black families . another economic theory dates back to the late 1950s and early '60s , the creation of the `` man-in-the-house '' rule ; this restricted two parent households from receiving government benefits which made many black fathers move out to be able to receive help to support their families . while majority opinion tends to center on the increase in poverty as a result of single-parent homes , research has shown that this is not always the case . in one study examining the effects of single-parent homes on parental stress and practices , the researchers found that family structure and marital status were not as big a factor as poverty and the experiences the mothers had while growing up . furthermore , the authors found little parental dysfunction in parenting styles and efficacy for single-mothers , suggesting that two-parent homes are not always the only type of successful family structures . the authors suggest that focus should also be placed on the poverty that african americans face as a whole , rather than just those who live in single-parent homes and those who are of the typical african american family structure .
bank of america deployed 60 analysts from its headquarters in charlotte , n.c. , to countrywide 's headquarters in calabasas , calif. . after four weeks analyzing countrywide 's legal and financial predicament , and modeling how its loan portfolio was likely to perform , bank of america offered an all-stock deal valued at $ 4 billion for countrywide -- a fraction of the company 's $ 24 billion market value a year ago . countrywide shareholders approved the deal on june 25 , 2008 and it closed july 2 , 2008 . bank of america announced on june 26 , 2008 that the takeover of countrywide financial corp. will result in the loss of 7,500 jobs over the next two years . on september 28 , 2012 , bank of america settled the class action lawsuit over the merrill lynch acquisition and will pay $ 2.43 billion . this was one of the first major securities class action lawsuits stemming from the financial crisis of 2007 -- 2008 to settle . many major financial institutions had a stake in this lawsuit , including chicago clearing corporation , hedge funds , and bank trusts , due to the belief that bank of america stock was a sure investment . bank of america has formed a partnership with the united states department of defense creating a newly chartered bank dod community bank -lrb- `` community bank '' -rrb- providing full banking services to military personnel at 68 branches and atm locations on u.s. military installations in guantanamo bay naval base cuba , diego garcia , germany , japan , italy , kwajalein atoll , south korea , the netherlands and the united kingdom . even though bank of america operates community bank customer services are not interchangeable between the two financial institutions , meaning a community bank customer can not go to a bank of america branch and withdraw from their account and vice versa . deposits made into checking and savings accounts are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation up to $ 250,000 despite the fact that none of community 's operating branches are located within the jurisdictional borders of the united states .

elián gonzález remained a subject of media attention as he went to walt disney world resort one day , then met with politicians the next . throughout the custody battle , opinion polls showed that a majority of americans believed gonzález should be returned to his father in cuba , and that doing so was in the boy 's best interest . on april 19 , the 11th circuit court of appeals in atlanta ruled that gonzález must remain in the u.s. until the miami gonzálezes could appeal for an asylum hearing in may . cnn international , in large part a result of ted turner 's globalization ideals , began broadcasting on september 1 , 1985 , at first primarily broadcasting to american business travelers in hotels . the first studio for cnni was at cnn 's original studio building known as techwood , home at that time to all of turner broadcasting system 's channels . today , it is home to the turner studios complex that houses the entertainment channels . other early studios in atlanta were tucked away in various corners of the cnn center , and the newsroom lacked even a digital clock . following the announcement of the acquisition , at&t ceo randall l. stephenson stated that the company was `` committed to continuing the editorial independence of cnn '' . in august 2017 , deadline hollywood reported that at&t had considered spinning off cnn and its stake in tmz post-acquisition . in october 2017 , stephenson downplayed the possibility that the ongoing tensions between trump and cnn could affect the deal , stating that he '' know what the relevance of cnn is in terms of an antitrust review '' , and that at&t did not plan to make managerial changes to time warner properties that were operating well , such as cnn . later that month , cnn launched a new promotional campaign , `` facts first '' , in an effort to combat negative perceptions over the quality of its reporting .
debuted on 22 september 1981 , in japan , europe and north america , this generation of the accord being produced in japan , also became the first to be built in the united states , at honda 's plant in marysville , ohio . since its first year in the american market , it also became the best-selling japanese nameplate in the united states , retaining that position for about 15 years . in japan , a sister model called the honda vigor was launched simultaneously with the new accord . this allowed honda to sell the product at different sales channels called honda clio , which sold the accord , and honda verno , that sold the vigor . in 2003 , honda released its cog advertisement in the uk and on the internet . to make the ad , the engineers at honda constructed a rube goldberg machine made entirely out of car parts from a honda accord touring . to the chagrin of the engineers at honda , all the parts were taken from two of only six hand-assembled pre-production models of the accord . the advertisement depicted a single cog which sets off a chain of events that ends with the honda accord moving and garrison keillor speaking the tagline , `` is n't it nice when things just ... for the first time in the model 's history , honda developed two distinct versions of the accord when the fifth-generation model was launched in fall of 1993 ; one version for the european market and one for the north american and japanese market . honda and the rover group created the european accord and the rover 600 , a reflection of the past success they had with the honda legend and the rover 800 . this generation accord was also sold in japan as the isuzu aska , while some isuzu products were sold as honda products there also .

president donald trump is taking his case to the american people over why they should back him in the partial government shutdown . his primetime address on tuesday will be about the `` humanitarian and national security crisis on our southern border , '' he tweeted . but trump is facing an uphill climb : polls show a majority of americans blame him and republicans for the shutdowns , and the majority have also consistently been opposed to his idea of a border wall with mexico . the average of polls taken since the shutdown began indicate that americans are blaming republicans for the shutdown . as the partial government shutdown nears the one-month mark , there have been a number of public opinion polls examining how the public feels about the shutdown , which was sparked by a funding standoff over president donald trump 's proposal for a new wall along the border with mexico . six high-quality polls have been released this week touching on trump , the shutdown , the democrats in congress and the wall . most confirmed what we already knew from before the shutdown started : opposition to a border wall is widespread and deep . but beyond that general opposition , the new polls offer some consistent results , including : blame , in the public 's mind , rests largely at the white house many object to the shutdown , especially as a tactic to build the wall , few see a wall as an effective way to combat undocumented immigration . only 18 % of americans said they could trust the government in washington to do what 's right `` just about always '' or `` most of the time '' -- nearly the lowest that marker has ever been -- in a december 2017 survey by pew research . that was well before the longest government shutdown in history . a more recent but slightly different survey from gallup asked how much trust and confidence people had in the government when it comes to handling domestic problems . fifty-four percent said in the september 2018 gallup survey that they had either `` not very much '' confidence or `` none at all '' in the federal government in washington handling domestic problems .

'' after indicating the reasons the bishop added that the dangers of german catholics were also the dangers of austrian catholics : `` what i wrote in my pastoral of january 21 , 1933 . it is impossible to be at once a good catholic and a good national-socialist , ' is confirmed today . '' 30 . ... human laws in flagrant contradiction with the natural law are vitiated with a taint which no force , no power can mend . in the light of this principle one must judge the axiom , that `` right is common utility , '' a proposition which may be given a correct significance , it means that what is morally indefensible , can never contribute to the good of the people . but ancient paganism acknowledged that the axiom , to be entirely true , must be reversed and be made to say : `` nothing can be useful , if it is not at the same time morally good '' -lrb- cicero , de off . 17 . ... should any man dare , in sacrilegious disregard of the essential differences between god and his creature , between the god-man and the children of man , to place a mortal , were he the greatest of all times , by the side of , or over , or against , christ , he would deserve to be called prophet of nothingness , to whom the terrifying words of scripture would be applicable : `` he that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them '' -lrb- psalms ii . 3 -rrb- .
montgomery -- who claims that he escaped from aliens that had abducted him during the game of kick the can -- comes to dark 's home . he appears at the window and asks if he can come in . dark and montgomery discuss their mutual attraction for one another and montgomery asks dark if he can spend the night . dark agrees but makes montgomery promise he will never leave him . in 2000 , a monument to forrest in selma , alabama , was unveiled . on march 10 , 2012 , it was vandalized and the bronze bust of the general disappeared . in august , a historical society called friends of forrest moved forward with plans for a new , larger monument , which was to be 12 feet high , illuminated by led lights , surrounded by a wrought-iron fence and protected by 24-hour security cameras . the plans triggered outrage and a group of around 20 protesters attempted to block construction of the new monument by lying in the path of a concrete truck . donald trump made news last week when he abruptly walked away from two local television interviews after he was asked tough questions from reporters . it 's something trump has done before . in a 1990 cnn interview reviewed by cnn 's kfile , trump walked off an interview when reporter charles feldman pressed him on questions over the financial stability of his atlantic city casinos . the interview took place in march 1990 , just days before trump 's billion dollar atlantic city casino , the trump taj mahal , was set to open .
a new study about the incidence of rape involving college freshmen women will probably add to the ongoing debate about whether enough is being done on campuses to keep students safe . the study , conducted at a large unnamed private university in upstate new york and published in the journal of adolescent health , found that 19 % of women , nearly one in five , said they had been a victim of attempted or completed rape , either by force or while they were incapacitated due to alcohol or drugs , during their freshman year . `` what this says to me is , a lot of our young women are dealing with this sexual violence , and we all probably know young women '' who have been victims , said lead author kate carey , professor of behavioral and social sciences at brown university 's school of public health . the study , conducted by researchers at brown and miriam hospital 's centers for behavioral and preventive medicine , involved surveys with 483 first-year women who ranged in age from 18 to 21 . ua is a member of the association of universities for research in astronomy , a consortium of institutions pursuing research in astronomy . the association operates observatories and telescopes , notably kitt peak national observatory just outside tucson . ua is a member of the association of american universities , and the sole representative from arizona to this group . led by roger angel , researchers in the steward observatory mirror lab at ua are working in concert to build the world 's most advanced telescope . the following year , the university of arizona student body approved that `` bear down '' would be the new slogan for all wildcat athletic teams . in 1939 , the arizona state legislature issued a decree that `` bear down '' would be the exclusive property of the university of arizona .
in discussing the site for the united states air force memorial , originally to be near de weldon 's work , j. carter brown , chairman of the united states commission of fine arts in 1998 , described the marine corps memorial as kitsch . `` it was taken from a photograph , it is by a sculptor , even though he was a member of this commission at one point , who is not going to go down as a michelangelo in history -- and yet it is very effective , largely because of its site , '' he said . brown 's remark was met with calls for his resignation from the commission , and disagreement over his categorization from the commission 's staff . 38 men have served as the commandant of the marine corps . the first commandant was samuel nicholas , who took office as a captain , though there was no office titled `` commandant '' at the time , and the second continental congress had authorized that the senior-most marine could take a rank up to colonel . the longest-serving was archibald henderson , sometimes referred to as the `` grand old man of the marine corps '' due to his thirty-nine-year tenure . in the history of the united states marine corps , only one commandant has ever been fired from the job : anthony gale , as a result of a court-martial in 1820 . as the 1980s arrived , the force expansion was accompanied by battles against both communists and armed islamist rebels all over the country , and in 1986 even took part in the successful people power revolution . the latter years would also see them in action as one coup d'état after another was launched against the corazon aquino administration , all ending in failure . it also saw rodolfo biazon becoming the first and only marine corps general to head the armed forces as chief of staff after a fruitful term as superintendent of the philippine military academy , the first and only marine corps general officer to occupy the office so far in pma history .
during the latter half of the 20th century , washington university transitioned from a strong regional university to a national research institution . in 1957 , planning began for the construction of the `` south 40 , '' a complex of modern residential halls . with the additional on-campus housing , washington university , which had been predominantly a `` streetcar college '' of commuter students , began to attract a more national pool of applicants . by 1964 , over two-thirds of incoming students came from outside the st. louis area . buffalo wild wings & weck was founded in 1982 by jim disbrow and scott lowery . lowery 's parents had become disbrow 's guardians as they were his ice skating coaches . after disbrow had finished judging an amateur figure skating competition at kent state university , the pair met up to get some buffalo-style chicken wings to eat . failing to find any restaurant serving them , they decided to open their own restaurant serving wings . in the state of michigan , customers were reduced to watching the bowl game on a small number of televisions with no sound . a corporate officer of buffalo wild wings welcomed viewers to the game and encouraged people to watch a bowl game at one of their restaurants and at the same time disgruntled fans at the restaurants reported via twitter that they were in the wrong place to watch the game on big screens and with sound .
master mahan , in the religious texts of the latter day saint movement , is a title assumed first by cain and later by his descendant lamech . the title indicates that cain and lamech were each the `` master '' of a `` great secret '' in which they covenanted with satan to kill for personal gain . the term is found in joseph smith 's translation of the bible in genesis 5 -lrb- currently published by the community of christ -rrb- and in the pearl of great price -lrb- in chapter 5 of the book of moses -rrb- , a religious text of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints -lrb- lds church -rrb- . critics , who approach the issue from a secular perspective and argue that smith 's translation of the bible was influenced by his cultural environment , including strong local anti-masonry , generally suggest that the term is related to `` master mason , '' the highest degree of the blue lodge of freemasonry . mahan -lrb- persian : ماهان , also romanized as māhān or mâhân ; also known as māhūn -rrb- is a city and capital of mahan district , in kerman county , kerman province , iran . at the 2006 census , its population was 16,787 , in 4,138 families.mahan is well known for the tomb of the great sufi leader shah ne'emat ollah-e-vali , as well as shazdeh garden -lrb- prince garden -rrb- . the tomb of shah nur-eddin nematollah vali , poet , sage , sufi and founder of an order of darvishes , has twin minarets covered with turquoise tiles from the bottom up to the cupola . the mausoleum was built by ahmad shah kani ; the rest of the building was constructed during the reigns of shah abbas i , mohammad shah qajar and nasser-al-din shah . mcmahon or macmahon -lrb- uk : , us : ; older irish orthography : mac mathghamhna ; reformed irish orthography : mac mathúna -rrb- is an irish surname . the surname arose separately in two areas : in west county clare and in county monaghan . two twin-brothers had a short feud over their fathers title of marquis which eventually led to the splitting of his land and the brothers separately living in their new found counties . as a result of this , the county monaghan -lrb- airgíalla -rrb- macmahons are not related to the county clare -lrb- thomond -rrb- macmahons .
elmo is a muppet character on the children 's television show sesame street . he is a furry red monster with a falsetto voice , who hosts the last full fifteen-minute segment -lrb- five minutes after 2017 -rrb- on sesame street , `` elmo 's world '' , which is aimed at toddlers . he also speaks to himself in the third person . he was most often puppeteered by kevin clash . clash resigned from sesame workshop on november 20 , 2012 , and released a statement saying , `` personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work ` sesame street ' is doing and i can not allow it to go on any longer . i am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately . '' sesame workshop also released a statement : `` unfortunately , the controversy surrounding kevin 's personal life has become a distraction that none of us want , and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has resigned from ` sesame street . ' '' they stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as clash 's understudy and would take over his roles on the show . in november 2012 , at the age of 52 , clash came out publicly as gay in response to the allegations that led to his resignation from sesame workshop , stating , `` i am a gay man . i have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it , but felt it was a personal and private matter . '' clash 's privacy about his sexual orientation ended when the gossip website tmz broke the news that a college student from pennsylvania was claiming that he had a sexual relationship with clash that began when he was 16 . clash responded to tmz and admitted to a sexual relationship with the accuser , but countered that the relationship only happened after his accuser was a consenting adult .
attorney general william barr is expected to release special counsel robert mueller 's redacted report on the russia investigation to congress and the public on thursday morning , justice department spokeswoman kerri kupec said . the plan to release the redacted report on thursday means that all of washington will be on edge this week anticipating the nearly 400-page report from the special counsel . related : the 5 fights to expect after the mueller report is released the redacted report will provide more details into what was uncovered during the 22-month special counsel investigation into possible collusion between donald trump 's team and russia and possible obstruction of justice . last month , barr released a four-page summary of mueller 's principal conclusions , which stated that mueller 's investigation did not establish a criminal conspiracy between trump 's team and the russian government , and mueller did not reach a conclusion on obstruction of justice , though barr wrote the investigation did not exonerate trump . attorney general william barr said tuesday he expects to release a redacted version of special counsel robert mueller 's report `` within a week , '' but he does not plan to provide congress with an unredacted version of the report , setting the stage for a showdown with congressional democrats . barr told a house subcommittee tuesday that the redactions process was going `` very well , '' and he would use color-coded categories and explain the rationale for the redactions that are made from mueller 's nearly 400-page report . but he said he would not accede to democrats ' demands that he provide the full , unredacted report to congress , arguing that he can not legally release grand jury material and that he did not plan to ask a court to release it . `` i do n't intend at this stage to send the full , unredacted report to the committee , '' barr said . house democrats are prepping a swift response to attorney general william barr 's plans to release a redacted version of special counsel robert mueller 's report within the next week , after barr 's first public comments tuesday did little to quell the democratic anger over barr 's rollout of the special counsel probe . house judiciary chairman jerry nadler is preparing to `` very quickly '' subpoena the justice department and go to court seeking to obtain grand jury information , while house intelligence chairman adam schiff says he 's made a formal request to obtain the counterintelligence information from mueller 's investigation to learn whether the president is `` compromised '' in any way . `` i think that 's a betrayal to what he promised during his confirmation , '' schiff told cnn , referring to barr 's refusal so far to not provide congress with the full report and underlying evidence . `` but it 's what he was hired to do , which is to protect the president .
most of these models were the first blackberry models that had a built-in mobile phone , were the first models that natively ran java , and transmitted data over the normal 2g cellular network . rim began to advertise these devices as email-capable mobile phones rather than as two-way pagers . at this time , the primary market was still businesses rather than consumers . the 5810 was released on march 4 , 2002 . an aberration in this list , the 5790 , was released at a much later date as a niche model in 2004 after many color blackberry models were out . this non-phone blackberry was made available due to the demand for a java-based model that could run on the mobitex data-only network . the 5810/5820 shared the same physical casing and keyboard layout as the earlier 957 device . after mcclain 's stint at as the world turns concluded , rumors circulated about a return to all my children . in december 2005 , mcclain made an appearance on the show , and her popular character returned full-time a few months later . in a surprising turn of events , the character of dixie was killed off via poisoned pancakes on january 30 , 2007 , which caused a massive negative outcry from longtime fans and soap opera media . a front page headline on a soap opera weekly cover story quoted mcclain as saying , `` there was no negotiation . ''
on june 1 , 1929 , the board of regents of the university of new mexico unanimously approved the establishment of the university of new mexico press -lrb- unmp -rrb- . at the time , the university enrolled about one thousand students . the inaugural publications produced by the press were pamphlets ; the first hardcover , bound full-length book , new mexico history and civics , by lansing bloom and thomas donnelly came in september , 1933 . it does not appear that when the press was founded the regents had plans other than for the press to serve the university community by printing and distributing pamphlets , reports , and journals . the university of new mexico was founded on february 28 , 1889 , with the passage of house bill no. 186 by the legislative assembly of the territory of new mexico ; stipulating that `` said institution is hereby located at or near the town of albuquerque , in the county of bernalillo within two miles north of railroad avenue in said town , upon a tract of good high and dry land , of not less than twenty acres suitable for the purposes of such institution , '' and that it would be the state university when new mexico became a state . bernard shandon rodey , a judge of the territory of new mexico , pushed for albuquerque as the location of the university and was one of the authors of the statute that created unm , earning him the title of `` father of the university . '' two years later , elias s. stover became the first president of the university and the following year the university 's first building , hodgin hall , opened . the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical , geographical , and political context in which it is used . american is derived from america , a term originally denoting all of the new world -lrb- also called the americas -rrb- . in some expressions , it retains this pan-american sense , but its usage has evolved over time and , for various historical reasons , the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america . in modern english , american generally refers to persons or things related to the united states of america ; among native english speakers this usage is almost universal , with any other use of the term requiring specification .

'' roger ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 , writing : `` the beauty in this film is in its directness . there are some obligatory scenes . but there are also some very original and touching ones . this is a movie that has its heart in the right place .

donald trump on wednesday refused to say he would accept the result of the presidential election if he loses to hillary clinton , raising the possibility of an extraordinary departure from principles that have underpinned american democracy for more than two centuries . `` i will look at it at the time , '' trump said when asked during the final presidential debate whether he would concede if he loses on november 8 , following his claims that the election is `` rigged '' against him . he added : `` i will keep you in suspense . '' the comments at the las vegas showdown marked a stunning moment that has never been seen in the weeks before a modern presidential election . the final in-person showdown between hillary clinton and donald trump takes place on wednesday night at the university of nevada , las vegas . here 's what you need to know about the rules , format and structure of the third presidential debate : time : the debate will begin at 9 p.m. et on cnn and other major networks . it will last 90 minutes , with no commercials and no breaks . donald trump 's campaign manager on thursday dismissed suggestions the republican nominee is undercutting american democracy by refusing to say whether he will accept the results of the election if he loses . in an at-times contentious interview with cnn 's chris cuomo on `` new day , '' kellyanne conway tried to clarify trump 's comments that he would take a wait-and-see approach before accepting the outcome . `` what donald trump has said , over time , if you take all of his statements together , he has said that he will respect the results of the election , '' said conway , a veteran republican pollster who was named trump 's campaign manager in august . at wednesday night 's presidential debate , trump -- who has repeatedly said the election is rigged against him and claimed there is `` large scale '' vote fraud -- refused to say whether he will accept the results on november 8 .
the ron johnson era is over at j.c. penney . the troubled department-store chain announced late monday that johnson is stepping down and leaving the company after just a year and a half . he is being replaced by his predecessor , mike ullman , who led the company for seven years prior to johnson 's arrival . j.c. penney said in a securities filing monday that johnson 's departure `` is not the result of any disagreement with the company or the board of directors on any matter relating to the company 's operations , policies or practices . '' j.c. penney had a rough 2012 , and it was reflected in ron johnson 's paycheck . the department-store chain revealed tuesday that johnson , its ceo , received a total of $ 1.9 million in compensation for 2012 , down from $ 53.3 million in the year prior . none of the company 's senior executives received bonuses , j.c. penney said in a securities filing , `` due to the company 's financial results versus its goals . '' johnson 's compensation dropped sharply from 2011 to 2012 in large part because he received a special $ 52.7 million stock award upon joining the company . on october 15 , 2018 , soltau began as ceo and a member of the board of jcpenney following marvin ellison 's departure and the decline of the struggling company . she is the 25th woman currently leading a fortune 500 company , penney 's fifth chief executive in the past decade and first woman executive . under her leadership in 2019 , the company is scheduled to close dozens of stores after shifting its focus to home goods and women 's clothes .
in 1933 these national memorials were added to the national park system and the national memorial function assigned to the national park service , except perry 's victory memorial , which was administered by a commission until it was added to the system in 1936 . also , the fiscal functions of the mount rushmore national memorial commission were assigned to the national park service in 1933 and the memorial itself in 1938 . the first memorial was authorized by the continental congress on january 25 , 1776 , to honor general richard montgomery , killed during an assault on the heights of quebec in the midst of a snowstorm on the night of december 31 , 1775 . montgomery commanded new york troops sent a few months before on an expedition designed to win canada to the revolutionary cause . it failed before quebec , and montgomery , became one of the first revolutionary generals to lose his life on the field of battle . the montgomery memorial is not a part of the national park system . the 1960s brought about public awareness of america 's natural and historical wealth . the johnson administration became the start of a ` park 's for people ' mindset . director hartzog was the superintendent of the gateway arch national park , then known as the jefferson national expansion memorial , in st. louis and was a supporter of public involvement and publicly accessible parks . it was the second 50 years that saw a significant increase in parks accessible to the general populations .
president donald trump spent hours isolated in the third-floor residence of the white house for two straight mornings this week , agonizing over developments in the russia investigation , as aides scrambled to reschedule some briefings to prepare him for the most complicated foreign trip of his presidency . whether the 12-day journey to asia offers a welcome diversion -- or whether his preoccupation with russia becomes a dangerous distraction -- is a question that will be answered along the way as he leaves washington on friday . the president 's aides have spent months preparing an agenda that will keep trump engaged and upbeat , people familiar with the planning of the trip said . with this week 's indictments of two former campaign aides and the announcement of a guilty plea from another , advisers now hope the bustling diplomatic swing will prevent trump from further stewing over the russia inquiry . president donald trump will not visit the dmz , a senior administration official announced tuesday during a briefing from the white house podium . last monday , the white house first signaled trump would most likely forgo a visit to the heavily fortified border between north and south korea when he visits asia next month , bypassing what has been a symbolic opportunity for us commanders in chief to stare into the hermit kingdom . `` the president is not going to visit the dmz , '' the official said , explaining that `` there is not enough time in the schedule '' and that visiting the dmz has become `` a little bit of a cliché . '' the official said the white house had to pick between a visit to the dmz or a visit to camp humphreys , a joint us-south korean military base , which south korean president moon jae-in invited trump to visit . the white house stood by president donald trump 's previous comments when asked friday whether the more than a dozen women who have accused him of sexual assault were liars . white house press secretary sarah sanders offered a very short answer when asked if the white house thought the women were liars . `` we 've been clear on that in the beginning , and the president 's spoken on that , '' she said . the question came amid revelations in the media and entertainment industries and the realm of politics of stories of women coming forward to share encounters of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace .
on 14 november 1501 , elizabeth of york 's 15-year-old son arthur married catherine of aragon , daughter of king ferdinand ii of aragon and queen isabella i of castile . the pair were sent to ludlow castle , the traditional residence of the prince of wales . arthur died in april 1502 . the news of arthur 's death caused henry vii to break down in grief , as much in fear for his dynasty as in mourning for his son . albert had a stammer , which affected his ability to deliver speeches , and after october 1925 , elizabeth assisted in helping him through the therapy devised by lionel logue , an episode portrayed in the 2010 film the king 's speech . in 1926 , the couple had their first child , princess elizabeth -- `` lilibet '' to the family -- who would later become queen elizabeth ii . another daughter , princess margaret rose , was born four years later . albert and elizabeth , without their child , travelled to australia to open parliament house in canberra in 1927 . in 2012 , the vaux passional , an illuminated manuscript that was once the property of henry vii , was rediscovered in the national library of wales . it depicts the aftermath of elizabeth 's death vividly . henry vii is shown receiving the book containing the manuscript in mourning robes with a doleful expression on his face . in the background , behind their father , are the late queen 's daughters , mary and margaret , in black veils .
the climax of the exodus is the covenant -lrb- binding legal agreement -rrb- between god and israel mediated by moses at sinai : yahweh will protect israel as his chosen people for all time , and israel will keep yahweh 's laws and worship only him . the covenant is described in stages : at exodus 24:3 -- 8 the israelites agree to abide by the `` book of the covenant '' that moses has just read to them ; shortly afterwards god writes the `` words of the covenant '' -- the ten commandments -- on stone tablets ; and finally , as the people gather in moab to cross into canaan , the land god has promised them , moses makes a new covenant between yahweh and israel `` beside the covenant he made with them at horeb '' -lrb- deuteronomy 29:1 -rrb- . the laws are set out in a number of codes : abraham -lrb- né abram -rrb- is the common patriarch of christianity , islam , judaism , and some other religions . in judaism , he is the founding father of the covenant of the pieces , the special relationship between the hebrews and god ; in christianity , he is the prototype of all believers , jewish or gentile ; and in islam he is seen as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with adam and culminates in muhammad.the narrative in the book of genesis revolves around the themes of posterity and land . abraham is called by god to leave the house of his father terah and settle in the land originally given to canaan but which god now promises to abraham and his progeny . various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after abraham ; and , while promises are made to ishmael about founding a great nation , isaac , abraham 's son by his half-sister sarah , inherits god 's promises to abraham . abraham is given a high position of respect in three major world faiths , judaism , christianity and islam . in judaism he is the founding father of the covenant , the special relationship between the jewish people and god -- leading to the belief that the jews are the chosen people of god . in christianity , the apostle paul taught that abraham 's faith in god -- preceding the mosaic law -- made him the prototype of all believers , circumcised and uncircumcised . in islam , the prophet muhammad claimed abraham , whose submission to god constituted islam , was a `` believer before the fact '' and undercut jewish claims to an exclusive relationship with god and the covenant .

the 1890 census was the first to be compiled using the new tabulating machines invented by herman hollerith . the net effect of the many changes from the 1880 census -lrb- the larger population , the number of data items to be collected , the census bureau headcount , the volume of scheduled publications , and the use of hollerith 's electromechanical tabulators -rrb- was to reduce the time required to fully process the census from eight years for the 1880 census to six years for the 1890 census . the total population , of 62,947,714 , was announced after only six weeks of processing -lrb- punched cards were not used for this family , or rough , count -rrb- . the public reaction to this tabulation was disbelief , as it was widely believed that the `` right answer '' was at least 75,000,000 . the bureau can not share responses , addresses or personal information with anyone including united states or foreign government and law enforcement agencies such as the irs or the fbi or interpol . `` providing quality data , for public good -- while respecting individual privacy and , at the same time , protecting confidentiality -- is the census bureau 's core responsibility '' ; `` keeping the public 's trust is critical to the census 's ability to carry out the mission as the leading source of quality data about the nation 's people and economy . '' only after 72 years does the information collected become available to other agencies or the general public . 72 years was picked because usually by 72 years since the census is taken , most participants would be deceased . in 1979 , she married sandi easton , the first of her four husbands . they divorced after eight months , and sheena decided to keep the surname easton . that year , one of her tutors coaxed her into auditioning for esther rantzen , producer of the bbc programme the big time . rantzen was planning a documentary film to chronicle a relative unknown 's rise to pop-music stardom .

'' after the debate , at a rally in salt lake city , utah , bloomberg stated of the debate : `` trump was the real winner of las vegas debate '' and `` if we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base like senator sanders , it will be a fatal error . '' bloomberg 's campaign staff manager kevin sheekey stated that he believed it was ultimately a success for bloomberg , stating `` you know you are a winner when you are drawing attacks from all the candidates . everyone came to destroy mike tonight , it did n't happen . everyone wanted him to lose his cool .
the report concluded that former dci george tenet failed to adequately prepare the agency to deal with the danger posed by al-qaeda prior to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . the report was finished in june 2005 and was partially released to the public in an agreement with congress , over the objections of current dci general michael hayden . hayden said its publication would `` consume time and attention revisiting ground that is already well plowed . '' tenet disagreed with the report 's conclusions , citing his planning efforts vis-à-vis al-qaeda , particularly from 1999 . general hoyt vandenberg , eisenhower 's commander of air operations in europe , and , later , his intelligence chief became the cig 's second director while waiting to be appointed the first commander of the united states air force . one of his first actions was creating the office of special operations , and the office of reports and estimates . in the beginning the oso was tasked with spying and subversion overseas with a budget of $ 15 million , the largess of a small number of patrons in congress . vandenberg 's goals were much like the ones set out by his predecessor in the note he left leaving office , finding out `` everything about the soviet forces in eastern and central europe -- their movements , their capabilities , and their intentions '' in the shortest possible time . the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the united states , tasked with gathering , processing , and analyzing national security information from around the world , primarily through the use of human intelligence -lrb- humint -rrb- . as one of the principal members of the united states intelligence community -lrb- ic -rrb- , the cia reports to the director of national intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the president and cabinet of the united states . unlike the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- , which is a domestic security service , the cia has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering , with only limited domestic intelligence collection . though it is not the only agency of the federal government of the united states specializing in humint , the cia serves as the national manager for coordination of humint activities across the u.s. intelligence community .
sir john major -lrb- born 29 march 1943 -rrb- is a british politician who served as prime minister of the united kingdom and leader of the conservative party from 1990 to 1997 . major was foreign secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer in the thatcher government from 1989 to 1990 , and was member of parliament -lrb- mp -rrb- for huntingdon from 1979 until his retirement in 2001 . since the death of margaret thatcher in 2013 , he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all living former prime ministers . born in st helier , surrey , major grew up in brixton . major opened talks with the provisional irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- upon taking office . when he declared to the house of commons in november 1993 that `` to sit down and talk with mr adams and the provisional ira ... would turn my stomach '' , sinn féin gave the media an outline of the secret talks indeed held regularly since that february . the downing street declaration was issued on 15 december 1993 by major and albert reynolds , the irish taoiseach , with whom he had a friendly relationship : an ira ceasefire followed in 1994 . in the house of commons , major refused to sign up to the first draft of the `` mitchell principles '' , which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire . although major continued to defend britain 's membership of the erm , stating that `` the erm was the medicine to cure the ailment , but it was not the ailment '' , the disaster of black wednesday left the government 's economic credibility irreparably damaged . major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after black wednesday before eventually sacking norman lamont as chancellor of the exchequer , replacing him with kenneth clarke . this came after months of press criticism of lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in newbury . his delay in sacking lamont was exploited by major 's critics both inside and outside of his party , who used it to claim major was too indecisive .
throughout the 1980s , mubarak increased the production of affordable housing , clothing , furniture , and medicine . by the time he became president , mubarak was one of a few egyptian officials who refused to visit israel and vowed to take a less enthusiastic approach to normalizing relations with the israeli government . under mubarak , israeli journalists often wrote about the `` cold peace '' with egypt , observing israeli -- egyptian relations were frosty at best . mubarak was quick to deny that his policies would result in difficulties for egyptian -- israeli dealings in the future . in february 2011 , abc news reported that experts believed the personal wealth of mubarak and his family was between us$ 40 billion and us$ 70 billion from military contracts made during his time as an air force officer . the guardian reported that mubarak and his family might be worth up to us$ 70 billion garnered from corruption , bribes and legitimate business activities . the money was said to be spread out in various bank accounts , including some in switzerland and the uk , and invested in foreign property . the newspaper said some of the information about the family 's wealth might be ten years old . on 23 february 2011 , the egyptian newspaper eldostor reported that a `` knowledgeable source '' described the order of the prosecutor general to freeze mubarak 's assets and the threats of a legal action as nothing but a signal for mubarak to leave egypt after a number of attempts were made to encourage him to leave willingly . in february 2011 , voice of america reported that egypt 's top prosecutor had ordered a travel ban and an asset freeze for mubarak and his family as he considered further action . on 21 may 2014 a cairo court convicted mubarak and his sons of embezzling the equivalent of us$ 17.6 million of state funds which were allocated for renovation and maintenance of presidential palaces but were instead diverted to upgrade private family homes . the court ordered the repayment of us$ 17.6 million , fined the trio us$ 2.9 million , and sentenced mubarak to three years in prison and each of his sons to four years .

`` i 'm sorry . '' with those simple words , hillary clinton , who thought she would wake up wednesday as the first woman president-elect but crashed to a stunning election defeat to donald trump , ended her white house quest and likely her political career . the democratic nominee unequivocally conceded the presidential race , and said that the constitution requires a peaceful transfer of power . `` last night , i congratulated donald trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country . one of michigan 's senators voiced a willingness to work with president-elect donald trump one day after trump fought hillary clinton to a virtual tie in the state . debbie stabenow said she agreed with much of trump 's argument about a `` rigged system '' and that she would work with him to restrict companies from moving jobs overseas , for instance . how republicans scrambled to hold the senate `` what is clear is that the folks who feel left out and behind in this recovery wanted change and were willing to overlook a lot of faults , a lot of things , in order to get change , '' she told cnn 's erin burnett . `` it will be interesting to see if donald trump can get his republican colleagues who have been opposing bills that i 've had and other democrats have had , to actually now come around and be supportive . '' sen. elizabeth warren said wednesday even though she `` did n't want to see donald trump win , '' the massachusetts democrat and `` those of us who supported hillary clinton will respect this result . '' in a statement , warren brought up a focal point of trump 's campaign : his promise to rebuild the economy as an area for collaboration . `` president-elect trump promised to rebuild our economy for working people , and i offer to put aside our differences and work with him on that task , '' she wrote . `` but the integrity of our democracy is more important than any individual election , '' sen. warren said , echoing president barack obama and hillary clinton 's remarks from earlier today .
labor day in the united states of america is a public holiday celebrated on the first monday in september . it honors the american labor movement and the power of collective action by laborers , who are essential for the workings of society . it is the monday of the long weekend known as labor day weekend . it is recognized as a federal holiday . for 2010 , solis 's agenda was to enact some ninety new rules and regulations intended to grant more power to unions and to workers . whether solis would try to revive clinton administration ergonomics rules that had been discarded in the early days of the bush administration , and that business groups continued to oppose , was unclear . in the wake of the april 2010 upper big branch mine disaster in west virginia , the worst in the u.s. in forty years , solis announced that the labor department 's mine safety and health administration would conduct an internal review of its enforcement of the massey energy mine prior to the accident . she also requested that the national institute for occupational safety and health provide an independent analysis of that review . during 2019 solis , with fellow supervisor sheila kuehl , was a leader of the successful effort to stop a planned $ 1.7 billion mental health treatment center in the downtown area , intended to replace men 's central jail . solis and others argued that the new facility would become a de facto jail and instead urged the creation of smaller treatment facilities spread around the county . solis said in reference to contractors for any such project , `` i do n't want to see people who are just used to building brick and mortar . i want to see people who have a humanistic approach .

former vice president joe biden 's son hunter biden said he used `` poor judgment '' in serving on the board of a ukrainian gas company because it has become a political liability for his father . `` i did nothing wrong at all , '' he said in an interview with abc news recorded over the weekend at his home in los angeles and broadcast tuesday . `` however , was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is -- it 's a swamp , in many ways ? yeah . '' hunter biden 's decision to speak publicly about his seat on the board of a ukrainian natural gas company -- and his relationship with his father -- makes clear that he , at least , is concerned that he could be a problem for his father 's 2020 presidential campaign . `` i did nothing wrong at all , '' hunter biden told abc news in an interview that ran tuesday morning . `` however , was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is -- it 's a swamp , in many ways ? yeah . joe biden said sunday that even though he was the last top-tier democratic candidate to call for president donald trump 's impeachment , `` i 'm the reason there is impeachment going on . '' the former vice president lambasted trump for asking foreign governments to investigate him and his son hunter -- despite there being no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of either biden -- at a forum in iowa , saying that the president is leading the `` most corrupt administration in modern american history . '' `` it 's gotten so far now , if you do n't move on it , then what do we say to the rest of the world about who we are ? '' biden said .

the rules implemented by the mcgovern-fraser commission shifted the balance of power to primary elections and caucuses , mandating that all delegates be chosen via mechanisms open to all party members . as a result of this change the number of primaries more than doubled over the next three presidential election cycles , from 17 in 1968 to 35 in 1980 . despite the radically increased level of primary participation , with 32 million voters taking part in the selection process by 1980 , the democrats proved largely unsuccessful at the ballot box , with the 1972 presidential campaign of mcgovern and the 1980 re-election campaign of jimmy carter resulting in landslide defeats . democratic party affiliation skidded from 41 percent of the electorate at the time of the mcgovern-fraser commission report to just 31 percent in the aftermath of the 1980 electoral debacle . under the reform package , a 21-member unity commission , chaired by clinton supporter jennifer o'malley dillon and vice-chaired by sanders supporter larry cohen , is to be appointed `` no later than 60 days '' after the november 2016 general election . the commission would report by january 1 , 2018 , and its recommendations would be voted on at the next democratic national committee meeting , well before the beginning of the 2020 democratic primaries . the commission was to consider `` a mix of clinton and sanders ideas , including expanding ` eligible voters ' ability to participate in the caucuses in caucus states , a gripe of clinton 's campaign , and encouraging ` the involvement in all elections of unaffiliated or new voters who seek to join the democratic party through same-day registration and re-registration ' '' , which is one of sanders ' demands . the commission drew comparisons to the mcgovern -- fraser commission , which established party primary reforms before the 1972 democratic national convention . with just 8 days until the iowa caucuses , welcome to 2020 ! every sunday , i outline the 5 big storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail . and they 're ranked -- so the no. 1 story is the most important of the coming week .
fox news said on monday that it would no longer air an ad calling for president trump 's impeachment , a move that came after trump seemingly responded to the 60-second spot by attacking the billionaire democratic donor featured in it on twitter . `` due to the strong negative reaction to their ad by our viewers , we could not in good conscience take their money , '' jack abernethy , co-president of fox news , said in a statement . a fox news spokesperson declined to say exactly how the network measured the negative reaction the ad drew and how it determined the negative reaction met a threshold that necessitated no longer airing it . television networks have wide latitude about the commercials they air . at launch , only 10 million households were able to watch fox news , with none in the major media markets of new york city and los angeles . according to published reports , many media reviewers had to watch the first day 's programming at fox news ' studios because it was not readily available . the rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20-minute single topic shows like fox on crime or fox on politics surrounded by news headlines . interviews had various facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest . as indicated by a new york times article , based on nielsen statistics , fox appears to have a mostly aged demographic . in 2008 , in the 25 -- 54 age group , fox news had an average of 557,000 viewers , but dropped to 379,000 in 2013 while increasing its overall audience from 1.89 million in 2010 to 2.02 million in 2013 . the median age of a prime-time viewer was 68 as of 2015 . a study done by the pew research center found that around 60 % of fox news viewers identify as conservative .
in many legends and fictional tales , characters die after suffering a devastating loss ; however , even in reality people die from what appears to be a broken heart . broken heart syndrome is commonly described as a physical pain in the chest or heart or stomach area , which is due to the emotional stress caused by a traumatic breakup or the death of a loved one . broken heart syndrome mimics symptoms of a heart attack , but it is clinically different from a heart attack because the patients have few risk factors for heart disease and were previously healthy prior to the heart muscles weakening . some echocardiograms expressed how the left ventricle , of people with the broken heart syndrome , was contracting normally but the middle and upper sides of the heart muscle had weaker contractions due to inverted t waves and longer q-t intervals that are associated with stress . magnetic resonance images suggested that the recovery rates for those suffering from broken heart syndrome are faster than those who had heart attacks and complete recovery to the heart is achieved within two months . the sensations -- and the need to move -- may return immediately after ceasing movement or at a later time . rls may start at any age , including childhood , and is a progressive disease for some , while the symptoms may remit in others . in a survey among members of the restless legs syndrome foundation , it was found that up to 45 % of patients had their first symptoms before the age of 20 years .

dean of undergraduate admissions lee coffin announced on april 7 , 2015 that tufts would be accepting illegal immigrant students with and without deferred action for childhood arrivals -lrb- daca -rrb- . coffin said that undocumented students would no longer be considered international students , but rather domestic students . this was due to the activism of social justice group united for immigrant justice . the first cohort of undocumented students is in the class of 2019 . every winter just prior to final exams , students would run naked laps on the academic quad as a way to relieve the stress of finals , much akin to similar traditions such as the primal scream at harvard . due to increasing scrutiny from the administration and injuries incurred by slipping on the icy roads , the tradition was banned in 2011 by then-president lawrence bacow , much to students ' dismay . a protest run took place the following year , with some students donning nude colored leotards and others taking the opposite tack calling their event the `` excessively overdressed quad stroll '' . starting in 2016 , the tradition was revitalized for spring finals week and briefly became an annual tradition once more . in the 1840s , the universalist church wanted to open a college in new england , and charles tufts donated 20 acres to the church in 1852 to help them achieve this goal . charles tufts had inherited the land , a barren hill which was one of the highest points in the boston area , called walnut hill , and when asked by a family member what he intended to do with the land , he said `` i will put a light on it .

rep. joe kennedy said he hopes for the sake of the country and the integrity of the us election process that special counsel robert mueller turns up nothing in his russia investigation . `` it is probably too much to hope that what mueller 's report is actually going to say is , ` nothing to see here , nobody did anything wrong , we got everyone already and case closed .

'' open a newspaper on any given day here in this small europe nation known for high taxes , generous government services and its stubbornly happy citizens , and you 'll almost certainly find a story about the u.s. presidential election . the danes are following the race with an astounding level of enthusiasm and interest in part because bernie sanders , one of the leading candidates for the democratic nomination , wo n't stop talking about them . sanders has proudly adopted the label of a `` democratic socialist , '' and he has pointed to denmark as a model for his vision of an ideal american future . at a presidential debate hosted by cnn in october , sanders brought up denmark and the surrounding scandinavian states when asked to describe what `` democratic socialism '' means to him . detroit -lrb- , locally also ; french : détroit , lit . ` strait ' -rrb- is the largest and most populous city in the u.s. state of michigan , the largest american city on the united states -- canada border , and the seat of wayne county . the municipality of detroit had a 2018 estimated population of 672,662 , making it the 23rd-most populous city in the united states . the metropolitan area , known as metro detroit , is home to 4.3 million people , making it the second-largest in the midwest after the chicago metropolitan area .

federal prosecutors in new york on monday unsealed a criminal indictment charging multimillionaire jeffrey epstein with having operated a sex trafficking ring in which he sexually abused dozens of underage girls . but the allegations of sexual misconduct against him are n't anything new -- they first emerged over a decade ago . here 's how they 've been treated in the years since they first emerged . former us attorney 's ` deal of a lifetime ' epstein , 66 , is accused of running a trafficking enterprise between 2002 and 2005 , allegedly paying hundreds of dollars in cash to girls as young as 14 to have sex with him at his upper east side home and his estate in palm beach , according to the indictment . one girl says she celebrated her 16th birthday with multimillionaire jeffrey epstein during the time he was sexually abusing her . another says she was just a middle schooler when she was first brought to his palm beach mansion and was abused . then there 's the teen who says epstein groomed her for abuse by promising to help her get into college . the stories are among those from dozens of girls -- now women -- who have publicly shared their allegations of sexual abuse by epstein , in media reports and lawsuits , for more than a decade . a new state law in new york could give jeffrey epstein 's alleged victims more opportunities to seek justice . in january , the state legislature passed the child victims act , which expanded the statute of limitations in child sex abuse cases to give survivors more time to seek criminal charges or sue their abusers -- or both . under the new law , which gov. andrew cuomo signed in february , survivors of child sexual assault can pursue criminal felony charges until they turn 28 , and file a civil lawsuit before age 55 .
between series 7 -- 8 , liam was the remaining gallagher on the chatsworth estate that possesses any sense of responsibility and maturity . in series 8 , when the family received the news of debbie 's death in afghanistan , liam was willing to travel on his own to personally break the news to fiona . but there was no need , as the news turned out to be a cruel hoax by the returning monica . when monica came back , liam finally confronted his mother on her attitude toward her family . coming of age in coatbridge in the late 1970s was difficult from a socio-economic perspective , as the town had relied heavily on steel mills , which were all closing , leaving career options and futures uncertain . gallagher had started drinking around age 13 , and by his late-teens had got into some trouble requiring a court appearance , which ultimately directed him to working on-stage : it was gallagher 's self-admitted flippant response to his probation officer -- who had asked gallagher what he thought he 'd like to do with his life -- that he fancied becoming a performer of some sort , `` actin ' or singin ' or whatever . '' this led to involvement in youth theatre groups , which eventually developed into a career path , via a successful audition at the royal scottish academy of music and drama . in the early series , ian is depicted as closest to his brother lip , with whom he shares a room , and is initially the only member of his family to know that he was gay . the brothers often have to look out for each other more than any of the other characters , due to being party to each other 's secrets . in later series , all the family , except frank gallagher -lrb- david threlfall -rrb- , are aware of his sexuality . however , it was often implied frank knew all along but did n't care and accepted ian for who he was .

former texas gov. rick perry told cnn thursday he will support donald trump as the republican presidential nominee and will do everything he can do to help him get elected . perry , speaking by phone from his hometown of roundtop , texas , acknowledged trump is not his ideal choice . when perry was a candidate for president earlier in the 2016 cycle , he was the first to come out and criticize trump and question his conservative credentials , calling his candidacy a `` cancer on conservatism . '' as his meeting with republican leaders demonstrated thursday , donald trump is entering a new phase in his quest for the presidency -- one that makes different demands of him as a leader and is perhaps less suited to his natural strengths . the first phase tested him as a brawler , and he was stunningly effective . whether you like or dislike trump , you have to hand it to him that he took on 16 other candidates , some far more experienced in politics , and personally knocked most of them out of the ring . he more than proved he can be destructive . donald trump sat down with majority leader mitch mcconnell and a group of gop senate leaders in washington on thursday -- meetings that included ohio 's rob portman , alabama 's jeff sessions , and south dakota 's john thune -- all of whom have been mentioned as potential trump running mates . a two-term senator from ohio , portman is seen as a broadly acceptable figure who would bring legislative experience to a potential ticket . he is also popular in a crucial battleground state , which will be key in november but where trump lost to john kasich in the primary . portman , however , has been adamant in his lack of interest in the vice presidential nomination .
ideas for legislation can come from members , lobbyists , state legislatures , constituents , legislative counsel , or executive agencies . anyone can write a bill , but only members of congress may introduce bills . most bills are not written by congress members , but originate from the executive branch ; interest groups often draft bills as well . the usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review . after passage by both houses , a bill is enrolled and sent to the president for approval . the president may sign it making it law or veto it , perhaps returning it to congress with the president 's objections . a vetoed bill can still become law if each house of congress votes to override the veto with a two-thirds majority . finally , the president may do nothing -- neither signing nor vetoing the bill -- and then the bill becomes law automatically after ten days -lrb- not counting sundays -rrb- according to the constitution . obstructing the work of congress is a crime under federal law and is known as contempt of congress . each member has the power to cite individuals for contempt but can only issue a contempt citation -- the judicial system pursues the matter like a normal criminal case . if convicted in court , an individual found guilty of contempt of congress may be imprisoned for up to one year .

facebook really wants to gain the trust of publishers after a contentious year of fake news and algorithm changes , as well as concerns the giant social network is squeezing out news sites . at a panel discussion at the sxsw conference , facebook 's head of news product , alex hardiman , said facebook is `` redefining its relationship '' with publishers . the company is experimenting with new products and services to better serve news organizations and promote accurate journalism , she said . `` as we are making the shift to quality , everything is on the table , '' hardiman said on friday . in 2016 , more than a quarter of americans read online stories that were `` fake news '' -- or deliberately false information or propaganda disguised as actual news reporting , researchers found . the most successful fake election news on facebook generated more engagement than the top stories from the new york times , the washington post , huffington post , nbc news and others , another analysis showed . the overall problem of fake news , however , is much bigger than election interference . after october 's mass shooting in las vegas , the top google news results included links to fake news and conspiracy theories . facebook 's first black eye was from `` fake news . '' the social network 's secretive algorithm enabled hoaxes and lies to reach millions of people during the us presidential campaign in 2016 . analysts were taken aback by the scope of the problem . facebook vowed to make changes .

this , along with the explosion of independent film and ever-decreasing costs for filmmaking , changed the landscape of american movie-making once again and led a renaissance of filmmaking among hollywood 's lower and middle-classes -- those without access to studio financial resources . with the rise of the dvd in the 21st century , dvds have quickly become even more profitable to studios and have led to an explosion of packaging extra scenes , extended versions , and commentary tracks with the films . the major film studios of hollywood are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket selling movies in the world . moreover , many of hollywood 's highest-grossing movies have generated more box-office revenue and ticket sales outside the united states than films made elsewhere . in the 1970s , the films of new hollywood filmmakers were often both critically acclaimed and commercially successful . while the early new hollywood films like bonnie and clyde and easy rider had been relatively low-budget affairs with amoral heroes and increased sexuality and violence , the enormous success enjoyed by friedkin with the exorcist , spielberg with jaws , coppola with the godfather and apocalypse now , scorsese with taxi driver , kubrick with 2001 : a space odyssey , polanski with chinatown , and lucas with american graffiti and star wars , respectively helped to give rise to the modern `` blockbuster '' , and induced studios to focus ever more heavily on trying to produce enormous hits .
in many recent years , the university of california system has faced increased and growing criticism for its high admittance of out-of-state or international students as opposed to in-state , californian students . in particular , uc berkeley and uc los angeles have been heavily criticized for this phenomenon due to their extraordinarily low acceptance rates compared to other universities in the system . at a board of regents meeting in 2015 , california governor jerry brown reportedly said on the problem of the uc 's relationship with californian applicants , `` and so you got your foreign students and you got your 4.0 folks , but just the kind of ordinary , normal students , you know , that got good grades but were n't at the top of the heap there -- they 're getting frozen out . '' although the city of santa cruz already exhibited a strong conservation ethic before the founding of the university , the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s with the university 's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development . early student and faculty activism at ucsc pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area . the lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc . a large and growing population of politically liberal ucsc alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly republican to markedly left-leaning , consistently voting against expansion measures on the part of both town and gown . the university of california , irvine -lrb- with san diego and santa cruz -rrb- was one of three new university of california campuses established in the 1960s under the california master plan for higher education . during the 1950s , the university of california saw the need for the new campuses to handle both the large number of college-bound world war ii veterans -lrb- largely due to the g. i. bill -rrb- and the expected increase in enrollment from the post-war baby boom . one of the new campuses was to be in the los angeles area ; the location selected was irvine ranch , an area of agricultural land bisecting orange county from north to south .
the concept of valentine 's day was introduced into pakistan during the late 1990s with special tv and radio programs . the jamaat-e-islami political party has called for the banning of valentine 's day celebration . despite this , the celebration is becoming popular among urban youth and the florists expect to sell a great amount of flowers , especially red roses . the case is the same with card publishers . during the middle ages , it was believed that birds paired in mid-february . this was then associated with the romance of valentine . although these legends differ , valentine 's day is widely recognized as a day for romance and devotion . the day first became associated with romantic love within the circle of geoffrey chaucer in the 14th century , when the tradition of courtly love flourished . in 18th-century england , it grew into an occasion in which couples expressed their love for each other by presenting flowers , offering confectionery , and sending greeting cards -lrb- known as `` valentines '' -rrb- . valentine 's day symbols that are used today include the heart-shaped outline , doves , and the figure of the winged cupid . since the 19th century , handwritten valentines have given way to mass-produced greeting cards .
a proud looking but rather worn president kibaki handed over the kenyan presidency to his successor , uhuru kenyatta , on 9 april 2013 at a public inauguration ceremony held at kenya 's largest stadium . `` i am happy to pass the torch of leadership to the new generation of leaders '' , said kibaki . he also thanked his family and all kenyans for the support they had given him throughout his tenure in office , and cited the various achievements his government made . despite opposition from conservatives and veterans of the vietnam war , clinton normalized relations with vietnam in 1995 . that same year , he became the first u.s. president to visit vietnam . clinton was also the first president to visit botswana , slovenia , and south africa . in their respective capacities as a former president and a former first lady , bill and hillary clinton attended the inauguration of donald trump with their daughter , chelsea . the morning of the inauguration clinton wrote on her twitter account , `` i 'm here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values , i will never stop believing in our country & its future . ''
the approval of the senate and the house of representatives is required for a bill to become law . both houses must pass the same version of the bill ; if there are differences , they may be resolved by a conference committee , which includes members of both bodies . for the stages through which bills pass in the senate , see act of congress . he constitutional prerogative of the house has been held to apply to all the general appropriations bills , and the senate 's right to amend these has been allowed the widest possible scope . the upper house may add to them what it pleases ; may go altogether outside of their original provisions and tack to them entirely new features of legislation , altering not only the amounts but even the objects of expenditure , and making out of the materials sent them by the popular chamber measures of an almost totally new character . the house of representatives passed a bill banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy on wednesday . the measure passed mostly on a party line vote , 242-184 , with one member voting present . earlier this year house republican leaders were forced to cancel a vote on the legislation , known as the `` pain capable unborn child protection act , '' when several female house republican members rebelled against it . they argued some provisions dealing with exceptions for rape could threaten the party 's efforts to attract support from women and younger voters .
in the first half of 2014 , blakely worked on building the company 's first standalone retail stores in shopping malls along the east coast of the u.s. , and also introduced denim to an expanding spanx product line for the `` fall '' range in march . during the inception of spanx , blakely was contacting friends and acquaintances , including those from her past , and asking them to seek out her products at select department stores in exchange for a check that she would send to them by mail as a token of appreciation . however , spanx received a marketing boost shortly afterwards , when oprah winfrey endorsed the product as one of her `` favorite things '' on her television show in 2000 . prior to officially establishing the company , blakely had sent a basket of spanx products to winfrey 's television program , with a gift card that explained what she was attempting to develop , and this garnered winfrey 's attention . after her short stint at disney , blakely accepted a job with office supply company danka , where she sold fax machines door-to-door . she was quite successful in sales and was promoted to national sales trainer at the age of 25 . forced to wear pantyhose in the hot floridian climate for her sales role , blakely disliked the appearance of the seamed foot while wearing open-toed shoes , but liked the way that the control-top model eliminated panty lines and made her body appear firmer . for her attendance at a private party , she experimented by cutting off the feet of her pantyhose while wearing them under a new pair of slacks and found that the pantyhose continuously rolled up her legs , but she also achieved the desired result -lrb- the original pants are now enshrined at spanx headquarters -rrb- .
during attorney general barr 's testimony before the senate judiciary committee on may 1 , barr again said he was looking into the origins of the fbi 's russia probe . `` many people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant and a fisa warrant , '' barr stated . `` i 'd like to find out whether that is in fact true . it strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort designed to stop a threat as it 's being represented . '' when asked by republican representative john cornyn `` can we state with confidence that the steele dossier was not part of the russian disinformation campaign '' barr responded `` no . on may 29 , 2019 , mueller announced that he was retiring as special counsel and that the office would be shut down , and he spoke publicly about the report for the first time . saying `` he report is my testimony , '' he indicated he would have nothing to say that was n't already in the report . on the subject of obstruction of justice , he said he had been prohibited by justice department policy from charging the president with a crime and that any potential wrongdoing by a president must be addressed by a `` process other than the criminal justice system '' . this suggested that the investigation could now be picked up by congress . the new york times reported on march 7 , 2018 , that the mueller investigation is aware of conversations trump had with two witnesses regarding their testimony with investigators . in one conversation , trump asked white house counsel don mcgahn to issue a statement denying a story the times published in january 2018 . that story reported that mcgahn told investigators trump had ordered him to direct the justice department to dismiss mueller . mcgahn never issued the statement and reportedly told trump that the president had , in fact , told him to have mueller dismissed .
`` sweet seymour skinner 's baadasssss song '' was written by bill oakley and josh weinstein , and directed by bob anderson . oakley and weinstein decided to do a skinner and bart episode because the staff wanted to take a diversion from the relatively wacky , fast-paced episodes that had comprised season 5 so far and , according to show runner david mirkin , `` slow down parts of the show to take time for more emotional episodes like this one '' . much of principal skinner 's behavior in the episode is based on teachers oakley and weinstein had in high school who , according to oakley , were `` sad , lonely guys who lived with their mothers '' . it was selected to air as the 100th episode of the show because the staff wanted that particular episode to focus on bart . in an interview , phillips talks about lima : `` she 's so powerful , really an entity , in a way . '' then added `` you meet her and there 's a generosity of spirit and very friendly and easy manner , and then all of sudden , the lights go on , and you realize you 're working with this absolutely extraordinary person who 's capable of creating these powerful images . '' in a 2011 interview with the daily telegraph , prior to the victoria 's secret fashion show , lima said that for nine days before the show she drinks only protein shakes , and no liquids at all for the last 12 hours `` so you dry out , sometimes you can lose up to eight pounds just from that . '' she also stated that for the last three weeks before the show , she works out twice a day . the interview prompted criticism from the media commentators . shortly afterwards , lima defended herself in an interview with e! .
darwin made a discovery new to science when he observed cilia moving the microscopic larvae of a species of the bryozoan flustra . he rushed to tell grant , confirming grant 's belief that the larvae of these marine animals were free swimming , but was upset when grant claimed rights to the work . darwin also made the discovery that black spores often found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech , and was disappointed when grant announced both finds to the wernerian on 24 march 1827 without giving darwin credit , though grant in his publication about the leech eggs in the edinburgh journal of science later that year acknowledged `` the merit of having first ascertained them to belong to that animal is due to my zealous young friend mr charles darwin of shrewsbury '' , the first time darwin 's name appeared in print . darwin made a presentation of both discoveries to the plinian society on 27 march , his first public presentation . the galápagos islands -lrb- official name : archipiélago de colón , other spanish name : las islas galápagos , spanish pronunciation : , local pronunciation : -rrb- , part of the republic of ecuador , are an archipelago of volcanic islands distributed on either side of the equator in the pacific ocean surrounding the centre of the western hemisphere , 906 km -lrb- 563 mi -rrb- west of continental ecuador . the islands are known for their large number of endemic species and were studied by charles darwin during the second voyage of hms beagle . his observations and collections contributed to the inception of darwin 's theory of evolution by means of natural selection . the galápagos islands and their surrounding waters form the galápagos province of ecuador , the galápagos national park , and the galápagos marine reserve . charles robert darwin , -lrb- ; 12 february 1809 -- 19 april 1882 -rrb- was an english naturalist , geologist and biologist , best known for his contributions to the science of evolution . his proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted , and considered a foundational concept in science . in a joint publication with alfred russel wallace , he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection , in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding . darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history , and he was honoured by burial in westminster abbey.darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book on the origin of species .
perhaps the most notorious witch trial in history was the trial of joan of arc . although the trial was politically motivated , and the verdict later overturned , the position of joan as a woman and an accused witch became significant factors in her execution . joan 's punishment of being burned alive -lrb- victims were usually strangled before burning -rrb- was reserved solely for witches and heretics , the implication being that a burned body could not be resurrected on judgment day . newley played matthew mugg in the original doctor dolittle -lrb- a difficult experience in part because of the hostility he endured from the lead actor , rex harrison -rrb- and he also played the repressed english businessman opposite sandy dennis in the original sweet november . he hosted lucille ball 's character on a whirlwind tour of london in lucy in london -lrb- 1966 -rrb- . he performed in the autobiographical , fellini-esque and x-rated can heironymus merkin ever forget mercy humppe and find true happiness ? , which he also directed and co-wrote with herman raucher . he appeared as quilp in mister quilp -lrb- 1975 -rrb- -lrb- based on dickens 's the old curiosity shop -rrb- , for which he composed some songs -lrb- ` love has the longest memory of all ' -rrb- . in india , labeling a woman as a witch is a common ploy to grab land , settle scores or even to punish her for turning down sexual advances . in a majority of the cases , it is difficult for the accused woman to reach out for help and she is forced to either abandon her home and family or driven to commit suicide . most cases are not documented because it is difficult for poor and illiterate women to travel from isolated regions to file police reports . less than 2 % of those accused of witch-hunting are actually convicted , according to a study by the free legal aid committee , a group that works with victims in the state of jharkhand .
in october 2015 , ceo mike mcavoy announced a restructuring of the organization , layoffs as well as a series of management changes . `` but even though we 've done well , we have not been able to keep pace with our ambitious goals for onion inc. '' kurt mueller -- the company 's coo -- elaborated on the details stating , `` we were overstaffed for the non-media-agency part of the business . we have less demand for a ton of new content for a brand . there 's demand , but we just overestimated what the demand is . '' according to jih-hsin tang , cheng-chung wang , bloggers tend to have significantly different patterns of self-disclosure for different target audiences . the online survey which involved 1027 taiwanese bloggers examined the depth and breath of what bloggers disclosed to the online audience , best friend and parents as well as nine topics they revealed . tang and wang -lrb- 2012 -rrb- , based on their research study on the relationship between the social penetration theory and blogging , discovered that `` bloggers disclose their thoughts , feelings , and experiences to their best friends in the real world the deepest and widest , rather than to their parents and online audiences . bloggers seem to express their personal interests and experiences in a wide range of topics online to document their lives or to maintain their online social networks . '' advocates for tor say it supports freedom of expression , including in countries where the internet is censored , by protecting the privacy and anonymity of users . the mathematical underpinnings of tor lead it to be characterized as acting `` like a piece of infrastructure , and governments naturally fall into paying for infrastructure they want to use '' .
on december 7 , 2016 , president-elect donald trump announced his intention to nominate pruitt as the administrator of the environmental protection agency . president-elect trump said that the epa had an `` anti-energy agenda that has destroyed millions of jobs '' and that pruitt , `` the highly respected attorney general from the state of oklahoma , will reverse this trend and restore the epa 's essential mission of keeping our air and our water clean and safe .

the walter payton nfl man of the year award is presented annually by the national football league -lrb- nfl -rrb- honoring a player 's volunteer and charity work , as well as his excellence on the field . prior to 1999 , it was called simply the nfl man of the year award . shortly after chicago bears running back walter payton died -lrb- having been the 1977 recipient himself -rrb- , the award was renamed to honor his legacy as a humanitarian . each year , a winner is selected from 32 nominees from the 32 different teams . the tradition of selecting a `` man of the year '' began in 1927 , with time editors contemplating the news makers of the years . the idea was also an attempt to remedy the editorial embarrassment earlier that year of not having aviator charles lindbergh on its cover following his historic trans-atlantic flight . by the end of the year , it was decided that a cover story featuring lindbergh as the man of the year would serve both purposes . the hasty pudding man of the year award is bestowed annually by the hasty pudding theatricals society at harvard university . it has been awarded since 1967 to performers deemed by the society members to have made a `` lasting and impressive contribution to the world of entertainment .

alaska in 1975 requested that the mountain be officially recognized as denali , as it was still the common name used in the state . attempts by the alaskan state government to have mount mckinley 's name changed by the federal government were blocked by members of the congressional delegation from ohio , the home state of the mountain 's presidential namesake . in august 2015 , secretary of the interior sally jewell announced that the name would officially be changed in all federal documents . while on an alaskan visit in the first week of september 2015 , president barack obama announced the renaming of the mountain . the united states secretary of the interior is the head of the united states department of the interior . the department of the interior in the united states is responsible for the management and conservation of most federal land and natural resources ; it oversees such agencies as the bureau of land management , the united states geological survey , and the national park service . the secretary also serves on and appoints the private citizens on the national park foundation board . the secretary is a member of the president 's cabinet . because the policies and activities of the department of the interior and many of its agencies have a substantial impact in the western united states , the secretary of the interior has typically come from a western state ; only three of the individuals to hold the office since 1949 have not been from a state lying west of the mississippi river . the current interior secretary is david bernhardt , who held the office in an acting capacity until april 2019 . he succeeded ryan zinke who resigned on january 2 , 2019 .

when she was five years old , sullivan contracted a bacterial eye disease known as trachoma , which caused many painful infections and , over time , made her nearly blind . when she was eight , her mother died from tuberculosis , and her father abandoned the children two years later for fear he could not raise them on his own . she and her younger brother , james -lrb- jimmie -rrb- , were sent to the run-down and overcrowded almshouse in tewksbury , massachusetts , today part of tewksbury hospital , and their younger sister , mary , was left to an aunt . jimmie had a weak hip condition and then died from tuberculosis four months into their stay . sullivan had been seriously visually impaired for almost all of her life , but by 1935 , she was completely blind in both eyes . on october 15 , 1936 , she had a coronary thrombosis , fell into a coma , and died five days later , on october 20 , at age 70 in forest hills , with keller holding her hand . keller described sullivan 's last month as being very agitated , but during the last week , she was said to return to her normal generous self . sullivan was cremated and her ashes interred in a memorial at the national cathedral in washington , d.c. . she was the first woman to be recognized for her achievements in this way . sullivan was devoted to his parents , particularly his mother . he corresponded regularly with her when away from london , until her death in 1882 . henry lytton wrote , `` i believe there was never a more affectionate tie than that which existed between and his mother , a very witty old lady , and one who took an exceptional pride in her son 's accomplishments .

representatives introduce a bill while the house is in session by placing it in the hopper on the clerk 's desk . it is assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage . drafting statutes requires `` great skill , knowledge , and experience '' and sometimes take a year or more . sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction . congress has an important role in national defense , including the exclusive power to declare war , to raise and maintain the armed forces , and to make rules for the military . some critics charge that the executive branch has usurped congress 's constitutionally defined task of declaring war . while historically presidents initiated the process for going to war , they asked for and received formal war declarations from congress for the war of 1812 , the mexican -- american war , the spanish -- american war , world war i , and world war ii , although president theodore roosevelt 's military move into panama in 1903 did not get congressional approval . in the early days after the north korean invasion of 1950 , president truman described the american response as a `` police action '' . during its first term in office , the upa government passed several social reform bills . these included an employment guarantee bill , the right to information act , and a right to education act . the nac , as well as the left front that supported the government from the outside , were widely seen as being the driving force behind such legislation . the left front withdrew its support of the government over disagreements about the u.s. -- india civil nuclear agreement .
major league baseball -lrb- mlb -rrb- is a professional baseball organization . it is the oldest of the major professional sports leagues in the united states and canada . a total of 30 teams play in major league baseball : 15 teams in the national league -lrb- nl -rrb- and 15 in the american league -lrb- al -rrb- . the nl and al were formed as separate legal entities in 1876 and 1901 , respectively . manchester city cleared a major hurdle in the quest to win back-to-back english premier league titles for the first time in its history with a battling 2-0 victory at the home of crosstown rival manchester united on wednesday . second half goals from bernardo silva and substitute leroy sane secured the win as city wore down and eventually outclassed united . with just three games of the season remaining the citizens now lead liverpool atop the table by a solitary point . and with fixtures against burnley , leicester and brighton to come , pep guardiola 's men will now be red hot favorites to claim what will be its sixth ever league crown . frank t. campbell -lrb- may 8 , 1836 -- march 6 , 1907 -rrb- was an american politician and businessman . born in ohio , campbell moved to newton , iowa and was in the newspaper and insurance business . he served in the union army during the american civil war . he served in the ohio state senate and then as lieutenant governor of iowa serving under governor john h. gear .
the intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term `` fare war '' to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes . through computers , new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines ' sales channels . for this purpose the airlines use the airline tariff publishing company -lrb- atpco -rrb- , who distribute latest fares for more than 500 airlines to computer reservation systems across the world . since airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair -lrb- such as `` show me flights from chicago to düsseldorf '' -rrb- , an airline that can codeshare with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a chicago -- düsseldorf flight . the passenger is advised however , that airline no. 1 operates the flight from say chicago to amsterdam , and airline no. 2 operates the continuing flight -lrb- on a different airplane , sometimes from another terminal -rrb- to düsseldorf . toward the end of the century , a new style of low cost airline emerged , offering a no-frills product at a lower price . southwest airlines , jetblue , airtran airways , skybus airlines and other low-cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so-called `` legacy airlines '' , as did their low-cost counterparts in many other countries . their commercial viability represented a serious competitive threat to the legacy carriers . however , of these , ata and skybus have since ceased operations .
television shows produced under the schneider 's bakery banner are noted for using the same stable of writers on all series , something that is atypical for scripted television series and especially sitcoms that are created by the same writer ; staff writers working for most of schneider 's series include andrew hill newman , george doty iv and jake farrow , among others . directors steve hoefer and russ reinsel also work for the company directing many episodes under the company banner . musicians backhouse mike and c.j. abraham are largely responsible for the music on the shows . jennifer tilly 's father was a gambler and a poker player , and gave her the video game world series of poker . she subsequently was taught the real game by her boyfriend when she moved to hollywood . sam doonby -lrb- john schneider -rrb- is a mysterious drifter who gets off a bus one afternoon in a small texas town to change and improve the lives of all he comes in contact with . it is a story of greed and envy , played out against the backdrop of the classic country and blues music that is performed in leroy 's bar . the film has been described by the producers as crazy heart-meets-it 's a wonderful life , while schneider described it as `` it 's a wonderful life without the wonderful .

in september 2010 , entertainment weekly reported that based on reviews from the film 's screening at the venice film festival , '' is already set to be one of the year 's most love-it-or-hate-it movies . '' leonard maltin , on his blog movie crazy , admitted that he `` could n't stand '' the film , despite praising natalie portman 's performance . reuters described the early response to the film as `` largely positive '' with portman 's performance being highly praised . the sydney morning herald reported that `` the film divided critics . garden state is a 2004 american romantic comedy-drama film , written and directed by zach braff and starring braff , natalie portman , peter sarsgaard , and ian holm . the film centers on andrew largeman -lrb- braff -rrb- , a 26-year-old actor/waiter who returns to his hometown in new jersey after his mother dies . braff based the film on his real life experiences . it was filmed in april and may 2003 and released on july 28 , 2004 . the black swan is a 2010 american psychological thriller film about a ballet dancer directed by darren aronofsky and starring natalie portman , vincent cassel , and mila kunis . after the 83rd academy awards , in which portman won the oscar for best actress for her role in the film as a ballerina , controversy arose over how much credit for the dancing in the film was being given to her and how much to her `` dance double '' , american ballet theatre soloist sarah lane .
three americans detained in north korea spoke out about their conditions and pleaded for u.s. help in interviews with cnn . kenneth bae , matthew todd miller and jeffrey edward fowle were presented to cnn 's will ripley at a pyongyang hotel monday . each was given five minutes for an interview . all three men said they hope the u.s. government will send an envoy to north korea to help get them out of their situations , similar to how former president bill clinton helped secure the release of two journalists in 2009 . when president barack obama steps in front of cameras wednesday , he 'll be addressing a nation that 's simultaneously war-weary and ready for more military action against isis ; critical of obama 's handling of the crisis yet largely supportive of his commitment to keep combat troops out . those currents of public opinion , however convoluted , will shape how obama frames his strategy for `` degrading and ultimately defeating '' the islamic state militants in iraq and syria , which americans now believe pose a real threat and must be combated . here 's what the polling suggests americans are listening for when obama speaks wednesday : what 's your plan ? when obama admitted to reporters his administration lacked a strategy for combating isis in syria , americans largely agreed with him . the number of people who say that acts of terrorism are likely to occur around the anniversary of 9/11 has significantly increased from three years ago . a new cnn/orc international survey indicates that 53 % of americans believe it 's likely for acts of terrorism to take place at this time , up from 39 % in 2011 during the 10th anniversary of the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people . `` it 's likely that the change is due to newfound concerns over isis , which seven in 10 americans believe has operatives within the u.s. able to commit an act of terrorism at any time , '' said cnn polling director keating holland . the poll results come as president barack obama addresses the public wednesday night on the threat of isis and lays out his strategy to combat the militant group in syria and iraq .
in the 1990s , in partnership with parent company pepsico 's fast food brands , two new flavors of doritos were introduced , taco bell 's taco supreme -lrb- incorporating a `` beef '' flavoring that was quite different from the original 1960s `` taco '' incarnation -rrb- and pizza hut 's pizza cravers . after pepsico spun off its restaurant division in 1997 , the flavors were simply renamed taco and pizza , respectively , with the pizza flavor discontinued in some markets . at around the same time , due to the popularity of frito-lay 's tostitos brand the unflavored toasted corn was briefly discontinued , then brought back . in 2008 , the taco bell -lrb- complete with the brand name attached -rrb- flavor was temporarily re-released under the `` back by popular demand '' label along with four cheese . in the spring of 2015 , doritos roulette was released to us markets for a limited time . while all chips appeared to look the same on the outside , one out of every six chips would be extra spicy . owing to the spicy nature of one variety contained in the pack , in july 2015 a school in the uk reported an incident where a student `` suffered some difficulty breathing after eating one '' . reincarnations and relaunches of taco-flavored doritos , including the 2008 `` back by popular demand '' campaign , were different from the original taco flavor -lrb- a sour cream flavor had been added to the recipe around 1985 -rrb- . the taco chips included in the zesty taco and chipotle ranch `` collisions '' bags were thought by customers to be closer to the original , but were later discontinued in most of the united states . in late 2010 , the taco flavor recipe that was used in the 1980s returned in a limited edition `` retro '' styled bag incorporating the original doritos logo , and in early 2011 the company announced that this incarnation would remain in the permanent product line-up .
by contrast , party leaders of the united states senate have often ascended to their position despite relatively few years of experience in that chamber , such as lyndon b. johnson , william f. knowland , and bill frist . former house majority leader eric cantor also had a comparatively quick rise to the post and was the youngest house majority leader in american history . most cabinet ministers are from the house of commons rather than the house of lords . in particular , all prime ministers since 1902 have been members of the lower house . -lrb- alec douglas-home , who became prime minister in 1963 whilst still an earl , disclaimed his peerage and was elected to the commons soon after his term began . -rrb- in recent history , it has been very rare for major cabinet positions -lrb- except lord chancellor and leader of the house of lords -rrb- to have been filled by peers . brat 's run for the house of representatives in 2014 was notable in its lack of resources and traditional campaign tactics . in his challenge of house majority leader eric cantor for the republican nomination , brat was outspent by cantor 40 to 1 : cantor spent over $ 5 million , while brat raised $ 200,000 and did not spend all of it . brat 's primary campaign was managed by 23-year-old zachary werrell . an analysis of campaign filings conducted by the center for responsive politics concluded that brat did not receive any donations from political action committees -lrb- pacs -rrb- , noting `` it 's almost impossible to profile brat 's typical donor , because he had so few . ''
in the period 1850 -- 1870 , the republican party was more opposed to immigration than democrats , in part because the republican party relied on the support of anti-catholic and anti-immigrant parties , such as the know-nothings , at the time . in the decades following the civil war , the republican party grew more supportive of immigration , as it represented manufacturers in the northeast -lrb- who wanted additional labor -rrb- whereas the democratic party came to be seen as the party of labor -lrb- which wanted fewer laborers to compete with -rrb- . starting in the 1970s , the parties switched places again , as the democrats grew more supportive of immigration than republicans . a major immigration bill that would give millions of people living illegally in america a path to citizenship cleared a key legislative hurdle tuesday when a strong senate majority voted to open debate on it . the 82-15 vote , with most republicans joining the chamber 's democratic majority in support , launched what was expected to be an arduous legislative journey for the 1,076-page measure . both supporters and opponents expect the bill to pass the senate despite fierce opposition from conservatives . however , one gop foe said tuesday the republican-controlled house would defeat it in its current form due to the pathway to citizenship . by ted barrett , cnn senior congressional producer -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the senate is to vote later tuesday to begin debate on immigration reform , an emotionally charged proposal with huge political stakes that may never get through congress despite years of negotiation and major compromise . it aims to create a 13-year path to citizenship for most of the country 's 11 million undocumented immigrants , a bipartisan proposal hammered out by the so-called `` gang of eight '' senators this spring that has the backing of president barack obama . polls show many americans also favor some form of immigration policy overhaul , depending on the details of legislation . gop leaders have signaled their support for starting debate , so a procedural motion aimed at doing so is expected to receive the 60 votes necessary to take that next step even if the fate of the legislation is uncertain .
americans are nationals and citizens of the united states of america . although nationals and citizens make up the majority of americans , some dual citizens , expatriates , and permanent residents may also claim american nationality . the united states is home to people of many different ethnic origins . as a result , american culture and law does not equate nationality with race or ethnicity , but with citizenship and permanent allegiance .
the candidates were in their sunday best attire and behavior last night at the alfred e. smith charity dinner . both president obama and mitt romney took playful jabs at each other and at themselves for a good cause . but it was probably just for one night . just a few days ago , there was little to joke about when the candidates went face to face over integral issues at the second presidential debate . as they struggle to save for retirement , a growing number of middle-class americans plan to postpone their golden years until they are in their 80 's . nearly one-third , or 30 % , now plan to work until they are 80 or older -- up from 25 % a year ago , according to a wells fargo survey of 1,000 adults with income less than $ 100,000 . `` it is so tough for americans to save for retirement that the answer seems to be to work longer , '' said joe ready , director of wells fargo institutional retirement and trust . overall , 70 % of respondents plan to work during retirement , many of whom plan to do so because they simply wo n't be able to afford to retire full time . first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell last week , but the broader trend remains choppy , making it difficult to get a clear reading on the job market in october . about 369,000 people filed for first-time unemployment benefits in the week ended october 20 , down 23,000 from the previous week , the labor department said thursday . the initial claims number has bounced around for the last five weeks , pointing to little improvement in the job market since september . the four-week moving average , which smooths out some of the volatility , has risen for the last two weeks but overall , the story there has largely remained the same since july .
the center for civic media was founded in 2007 as a joint effort of the mit media lab and the mit comparative media studies program . its initial funding , a four-year grant from the knight foundation , was won in a contest `` to foster blogs and other digital efforts that seek to bring together residents of a city or town in ways that local newspapers historically have done . '' the founders planned to `` develop new technologies and practices to help newspapers attract readers as a greater number of americans use the internet as their primary news source . '' it expanded in 2011 . for a history of the field , see history of media studies.the first media studies m.a. program in the u.s. was introduced by john culkin at the new school in 1975 , which has since graduated more than 2,000 students . culkin was responsible for bringing marshall mcluhan to fordham in 1968 and subsequently founded the center for understanding media , which became the new school program . brooklyn college , part of the city university of new york , has been offering graduate studies in television and media since 1961 . currently , the department of television and radio administers an ms in media studies , and hosts the center for the study of world television .

the white house `` beat '' concept that had been started during the cleveland administration by reporter william price was continued during the mckinley administration . around the time of the outbreak of the spanish -- american war in 1898 , the reporters covering the white house were invited into the mansion itself and provided with space to write , conduct interviews , and generally cover the white house . now reporting from inside the white house , the reporters used their new location to interview guests entering or leaving the white house or confirm pieces of information from the president 's secretaries as they passed through in the course of their duties . reporters working in the white house did , however , honor an unspoken rule and refrain from asking the president himself a question if he happened to walk through their working area . at the end of the cleveland administration , a new feature of press coverage of the white house materialized . william w. price , a southern reporter , auditioned for a job at the washington evening star by stationing himself at the white house to seek out stories . he interviewed guests coming and going from meetings or events with the president and ultimately reported a story in a piece carrying the headline `` at the white house '' . competitor newspapers responded by sending their own reporters to cover the white house in a daily , sustained way and soon the white house had reporters dedicated to covering the `` white house beat . '' assistant to the president became a rank generally shared by the chief of staff with such senior aides as deputy chiefs of staff , the white house counsel , the white house press secretary , and others . this new system did not catch on immediately . democrats kennedy and johnson still relied on their appointments secretaries instead , and it was not until the nixon administration that the chief of staff took over maintenance of the president 's schedule . this concentration of power in the nixon and ford white house -lrb- whose last chief of staff was dick cheney -rrb- led presidential candidate jimmy carter to campaign in 1976 with the promise that he would not appoint a chief of staff .
if you are way into politics , you are not the average american . not even close . a new poll from the university of pennsylvania 's annenberg public policy center reveals how shockingly little people know about even the most basic elements of our government and the constitution that formed it . take your pick from this bouillabaisse of ignorance : * more than one in three people -lrb- 37 % -rrb- could not name a single right protected by the first amendment . treasury secretary steven mnuchin thinks americans are right to be fed up with data breaches like the massive hack at equifax . `` americans should n't expect these things to happen , '' mnuchin said tuesday in manhattan . he called the breach `` obviously quite unfortunate . '' equifax revealed last week that as many as 143 million americans -- roughly half the country -- may have had personal information compromised in the hack this summer , one of the worst ever . americans are nationals and citizens of the united states of america . although nationals and citizens make up the majority of americans , some dual citizens , expatriates , and permanent residents may also claim american nationality . the united states is home to people of many different ethnic origins . as a result , american culture and law does not equate nationality with race or ethnicity , but with citizenship and permanent allegiance .
the mississippi baby -lrb- born 2010 -rrb- is a mississippi girl who in 2013 was thought to have been cured of hiv . she had contracted hiv at birth from her hiv-positive mother . thirty hours after the baby was born , she was treated with intense antiretroviral therapy . when the baby was about 18 months old , the mother did not bring the child in for scheduled examinations for the next five months . as a result of the re-occurrence of the virus in the mississippi baby , researchers are now asking whether fragments of the virus , which were still detectable , managed to recombine into a whole virus , or whether the virus managed to hide somewhere in the body that rendered it undetectable in testing . one hypothesis had been that babies might be born without viral reservoirs in which the virus could hide . anthony fauci told usa today that it had long been hypothesized that a cure for hiv was possible `` if you can get somebody treated before the reservoir of virus forms in the body , and before the immune system has been damaged by months or years of viral replication . '' for instance , healthcare workers exposed to hiv immediately receive therapy , which almost always prevents infection by hiv . the mississippi baby -lrb- born 2010 -rrb- is a mississippi girl who in 2013 was thought to have been cured of hiv . she had contracted hiv at birth from her hiv-positive mother . thirty hours after the baby was born , she was treated with intense antiretroviral therapy . when the baby was about 18 months old , the mother did not bring the child in for scheduled examinations for the next five months .
on november 30 , 2018 , george h. w. bush , the 41st president of the united states , died after a battle with vascular parkinson 's disease at his home in houston , texas . he was the first u.s. president to die since gerald ford in late 2006 . at the age of 94 years and 171 days , bush was the longest-lived u.s. president in history until march 22 , 2019 , when his record was surpassed by jimmy carter . on september 7 , 2017 , bush partnered with former presidents jimmy carter , george h. w. bush , bill clinton , and barack obama to work with one america appeal to help the victims of hurricane harvey and hurricane irma in the gulf coast and texas communities . george h.w. bush was christened on 7 october 2006 . former president george h. w. bush attended the ceremony and became the first president in history to participate in the christening of his namesake ship . president george w. bush also attended and honored his father during the ceremony as a special guest speaker .
one year later , the friends and their loved ones spend christmas together . isaac 's baby can not sleep , so the trio serenade her . it is revealed that the story is told from a book read by santa , the father of mr. green . senator bernie sanders said he does n't believe the official response from israeli authorities , who say that deadly clashes in gaza this past week were `` violent terror demonstrations , '' and that hamas fighters were embedded within a crowd of protestors . `` from what my understanding is , you have tens and tens of thousands of people who are engaged in a nonviolent protest . i believe now 15 or 20 people , palestinians , have been killed and many , many others have been wounded . so i think it 's a difficult situation , but my assessment is that israel overreacted on that , '' the vermont independent told cnn 's `` state of the union '' on sunday . caplan was cast in her role as johnson before they signed her co-star michael sheen as william h. masters because he was busy working on another production . producer sarah timberman said of caplan , `` the minute we met lizzie we thought that she just embodied so much of the spirit of virginia johnson . '' caplan also stated herself that as a single woman pursuing her career above a family , she identified with many of johnson 's characteristics . once she met the producers , it took several months before caplan was officially signed , and she turned down several other roles in the meantime .
in september 2009 , pfizer agreed to pay $ 2.3 billion to settle civil and criminal allegations that it had illegally marketed four drugs -- bextra , geodon , zyvox , and lyrica -- for non-approved uses ; it was pfizer 's fourth such settlement in a decade . the payment included $ 1.3 billion in criminal penalties for felony violations of the food , drug and cosmetic act , and $ 1 billion to settle allegations it had illegally promoted the drugs for uses that were not approved by the u.s. food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- and caused false claims to be submitted to federal and state programs . the criminal fine was the largest ever assessed in the united states up to that time . pfizer has entered an extensive corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general and will be required to make substantial structural reforms within the company , and maintain the pfizer website -lrb- www.pfizer.com/pmc -rrb- to track the company 's post marketing commitments . pfizer and its partner , pharmacia presented findings from their study that celebrex was `` better in protecting the stomach from serious complications than other drugs . '' this became celebrex 's main selling point . however , following federal investigations it was revealed that pfizer and pharmacia `` only presented the results from the first six months of a year long study rather than the whole thing . '' these partial results were then published in the journal of the american medical association . the 1906 act paved the way for the eventual creation of the food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- and is generally considered to be that agency 's founding date , though the agency existed before the law was passed and was not named fda until later . `` while the food and drug act remains a foundational law of the fda mission , it 's not the law that created the fda . the bureau of chemistry -lrb- the precursor to the fda -rrb- regulated food safety . in 1927 , the bureau was reorganized into the food , drug , and insecticide administration and the bureau of chemistry and soils .
white house adviser kellyanne conway is denying she suggested there was wider surveillance of president donald trump during the campaign , telling cnn monday that her comments in a recent interview were taken out of context . sunday night , conway appeared to expand trump 's allegations that the obama administration wiretapped his phones at trump tower -- a claim for which the president has not yet provided evidence -- when she told the bergen record there could have been even wider spying on the trump campaign , including the use of microwaves and television sets . she did not provide any evidence for the claims . pressed about the comments by cnn 's chris cuomo on `` new day , '' conway insisted she was not alleging actions by the obama administration against the trump campaign . harvard constitutional law professor laurence tribe told the new york times that `` you could n't think of a clearer example of violating the ban of using your government position as kind of a walking billboard for products or services offered by a private individual , '' adding `` she is attempting quite crudely to enrich ivanka and therefore the president 's family . '' chris lu , deputy secretary of labor in the obama administration , complained to jason chaffetz , chair of the united states house committee on oversight and government reform , that conway had violated federal ethics laws , also saying on twitter that , under obama , `` if we did what @kellyannepolls did , we would 've been fired '' . richard painter , chief ethics attorney for george w. bush , declined to say whether he thought conway 's statements broke the law , but that such actions would not have been tolerated in the bush administration . `` the events of the past week demonstrate that there is no intent on the part of the president , his family or the white house staff to make meaningful distinctions between his official capacity as president and the trump family business '' . during her appearance monday on cnn 's `` new day , '' kellyanne conway says she was talking about `` surveillance generally , '' walking back comments she made in an interview over the weekend suggesting surveillance of the trump campaign may have been broader than wiretapping . here are five key moments from her appearance monday : asked to clarify her comments on wiretapping , conway , one of president trump 's top aides , said she was talking about general news articles on surveillance techniques saying : `` i 'm not inspector gadget . i do n't believe people are using the microwave to spy on the trump campaign . '' she shrugged off questions about providing any evidence of foul play that the trump campaign may have , simply saying : `` i 'm not in the job of having evidence .
upon entering office , obama focused on handling the global financial crisis and the subsequent great recession that had begun before his election , which was generally regarded as the worst economic downturn since the great depression . on february 17 , 2009 , obama signed into law a $ 787 billion economic stimulus bill that included spending for health care , infrastructure , education , various tax breaks and incentives , and direct assistance to individuals . the tax provisions of the law , including a $ 116 billion income tax cut , temporarily reduced taxes for 98 percent of taxpayers , bringing tax rates to their lowest levels in 60 years . the obama administration would later argue that the stimulus saved the united states from a `` double-dip '' recession . many commentators credit obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the great recession . according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics , the obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his term . in 2010 , obama signed into effect the dodd -- frank wall street reform and consumer protection act . passed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007 -- 08 , it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the united states since the regulatory reform that followed the great depression under democratic president franklin d. roosevelt . the congressional budget office -lrb- cbo -rrb- and a broad range of economists credit obama 's stimulus plan for economic growth . the cbo released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1 -- 2.1 million , while conceding that `` it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package . '' although an april 2010 , survey of members of the national association for business economics showed an increase in job creation -lrb- over a similar january survey -rrb- for the first time in two years , 73 % of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment . the economy of the united states has grown faster than the other original nato members by a wider margin under president obama than it has anytime since the end of world war ii .
a subsequent report by the justice department inspector general in october 2008 found that the process used to fire the first seven attorneys and two others dismissed around the same time was `` arbitrary '' , `` fundamentally flawed '' , and `` raised doubts about the integrity of department prosecution decisions '' . in july 2010 , the department of justice prosecutors closed the two-year investigation without filing charges after determining that the firing was inappropriately political , but not criminal , saying `` evidence did not demonstrate that any prosecutable criminal offense was committed with regard to the removal of david iglesias . the investigative team also determined that the evidence did not warrant expanding the scope of the investigation beyond the removal of iglesias . '' on september 29 , 2008 the justice department 's inspector general -lrb- ig -rrb- released a report on the matter that found most of the firings were politically motivated and improper . the next day attorney general michael mukasey appointed a special prosecutor nora dannehy to decide whether criminal charges should be brought against gonzales and other officials involved in the firings . the ig 's report contained `` substantial evidence '' that party politics drove a number of the firings , and ig glenn fine said in a statement that gonzales had `` abdicated his responsibility to safeguard the integrity and independence of the department . '' the report itself stopped short of resolving questions about higher white house involvement in the matter , because of what it said were the refusal to cooperate of a number of key players , among them karl rove , senator pete domenici and harriet miers and because the white house refused to hand over its documents related to the firings . by july 1941 , justice department officials had decided that the ins would oversee the internment of enemy aliens arrested by the fbi should the u.s. enter the war , and immediately after the attack on pearl harbor these plans went into effect . by december 10 , three days after the attack , the ins had 1,291 japanese , 857 german and 147 italian nationals in custody . these `` enemy aliens , '' many of whom had resided in the united states for decades , were arrested without warrants or formal charges . they were held in immigration stations and various requisitioned sites , often for months , before receiving a hearing -lrb- without benefit of legal counsel or defense witnesses -rrb- and being released , paroled or transferred to a department of justice internment camp .
the expression seemed to produce action on the part of your father , for then he did one of the most dramatic things i ever saw done . he simply turned with mrs. hubbard and entered a room on the top deck , the door of which was open , and closed it behind him . forrest j ackerman , later hubbard 's literary agent , recalled that hubbard told him `` whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide . and he said that the last time he had shown it to a publisher in new york , he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was , the publisher called for the reader , the reader came in with the manuscript , threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window . '' in 1948 , hubbard would tell a convention of science fiction fans that excalibur 's inspiration came during an operation in which he `` died '' for eight minutes . he remained active in managing and developing scientology , establishing the controversial rehabilitation project force in 1974 and issuing policy and doctrinal bulletins . however , the sea org 's voyages were coming to an end . the apollo was banned from several spanish ports and was expelled from curaçao in october 1975 . the sea org came to be suspected of being a cia operation , leading to a riot in funchal , madeira , when the apollo docked there .
in march 2007 , producer neal h. moritz , who had been trying to acquire the film rights to the character for years , obtained the rights and through his sony-based production company original film optioned them to columbia pictures . in july 2007 seth rogen , in addition to starring in the lead role , was hired to co-write the script with frequent collaborator evan goldberg and named as an executive producer for the green hornet . rogen in july 2007 said he had not begun writing the screenplay yet , but anticipated the tone would be that of `` a buddy action movie '' with humor , `` like lethal weapon and 48 hrs . . in september 2008 , columbia pictures announced a june 25 , 2010 , release date , and that hong kong star stephen chow had signed to direct and to co-star as kato . in a positive review , vox 's karen han praised the series saying , `` the deconstruction of a fred rogers figure would make for an interesting show on its own , but kidding transcends that premise by leaps and bounds on the strength of carrey 's performance and a determination to make the show just as rough -- and riveting -- as real life . '' in another favorable critique , the hollywood reporter 's tim goodman offered similar acclaim saying , `` with its keen self-awareness , exceptional writing and consistently great acting , kidding -- starring a perfectly cast jim carrey in his first series-regular role since in living color two decades ago -- is showtime 's best and most binge-worthy series in a long time . '' ben travers at indiewire reviewed the first four episodes of the show , and called it an alt-reality mr. rogers , and that although the fixation on death is `` uncomfortable , it shows signs of a lighter , broader scope and is buoyed by unrelenting optimism . '' he praised the story for treating jeff 's sincerity with genuine respect , and carrey for his `` terrific '' and `` nuanced '' performance . `` around the world '' was gondry 's first attempt at bringing organized dancing to his music videos . `` i was sick to see choreography being mistreated in videos like filler with fast cutting and fast editing , really shallow . i do n't think choreography should be shot in close-ups .

russia -lrb- russian : росси́я , tr . rossiya , ipa : -rrb- , officially the russian federation , is a european country located in eastern europe with a vast expanse of territory that stretches across northern asia . at 17,125,200 square kilometres -lrb- 6,612,100 sq mi -rrb- , it is , by far the largest country in the world by area , covering more than one-eighth of the earth 's inhabited land area , spanning eleven time zones , and bordering 16 sovereign nations . the territory of russia extends from the baltic sea in the west to the pacific ocean in the east , and from the arctic ocean in the north to the black sea and the caucasus in the south .
this is a list of associate judges of the new york court of appeals , with their tenure on the court . the f-box proteins are divided into three classes : fbxws containing wd40 repeat domains , fbxls containing leucine-rich repeats , and fbxos containing either different protein -- protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs . the protein encoded by this gene belongs to the fbxls class . in addition to an f-box , this protein contains 10 tandem leucine-rich repeats . alternative splicing of this gene generates 2 transcript variants encoding different isoforms . skp2 behaves as an oncogene in cell systems and is an established protooncogene causally involved in the pathogenesis of lymphomas . one of the most critical cdk inhibitors involved in cancer pathogenesis is p27kip1 , which is involved primarily in inhibiting cyclin e-cdk2 complexes -lrb- and to a lesser extent cyclin d-cdk4 complexes -rrb- . levels of p27kip1 -lrb- like all other ckis -rrb- rise and fall in cells as they either exit or re-enter the cell cycle , these levels are not modulated at the transcriptional level , but by the actions of the scfskp2 complex in recognizing p27kip1 and tagging it for destruction in the proteasome system . it has been shown that as cells enter g0 phase , reducing levels of skp2 explain the increase in p27kip1 , creating an apparent inverse relationship between skp2 and p27kip1 .
as the battle progressed , bader often found himself at the head of a composite wing of fighters consisting of up to five squadrons , known as the `` duxford wing '' . achievements of the big wing were hard to quantify , as the large formations often took too long to form up , over claimed victories , and too often did not provide timely support of the over-committed 11 group . the episode probably contributed to the departure of park , who was replaced with leigh-mallory in november 1940 , and dowding . bader was known , at times , to be head-strong , blunt and unsophisticated when he made his opinion known . during one visit to munich , germany , as a guest of adolf galland , he walked into a room full of ex-luftwaffe pilots and said , `` my god , i had no idea we left so many of you bastards alive '' . he also used the phrase to describe the trades union congress during economic and social unrest in the 1970s . later , he suggested that britons in support of the campaign for nuclear disarmament were a `` rabble '' and should be deported . bader escaped from the hospital where he was recovering by tying together sheets . initially the `` rope '' did not reach the ground ; with the help of another patient , he slid the sheet from under the comatose new zealand pilot , bill russell of no. 485 squadron , who had had his arm amputated the day before . russell 's bed was then moved to the window to act as an anchor .

trapped in the abyss , oz finds out he can make contracts with chains by drinking their blood . he does so with a chain named alice , infamously known as the bloody black rabbit -lrb- or b-rabbit for short -rrb- , in order to escape the prison . by the time they escape from the abyss , ten years have already passed . he is taken under the care of sharon and break , who he discovers are members of a chain-research organization called pandora that was established a century ago after a disaster known as the tragedy of sablier -lrb- in which the entire city of sablier fell into the abyss -rrb- by the four great dukedoms . after arguing that both ascap and bmi were showing bias towards international broadcasters who own terrestrial radio stations , pandora announced on june 11 , 2013 that it would attempt to acquire kxmz , a radio station in south dakota , under the presumption that doing so would allow it to access the same preferential licensing terms offered to services such as iheartradio -lrb- which is owned by iheartmedia , inc. , itself america 's largest radio broadcaster -rrb- . the move was criticized by david israelite , ceo of the national music publishers association , who declared that pandora was now `` at war with songwriters , '' and had lost its credibility because it was resorting to `` lawsuits and gimmicks '' to make its point . however , a member of public knowledge praised the move , by stating that it was `` a perfect example of the twisted incentives and strange results we get from a music licensing system that is based on who wants a license instead of just what they want to do with the music they 're using . '' ascap also objected to the deal , filing a petition to deny with the fcc . in 2008 , the founder of pandora stated that the company may be on the verge of collapse . royalty fees account for a majority portion of pandora 's revenues . if an agreement between pandora and soundexchange had not been reached , it could have meant the end of pandora . `` we 're losing money as it is , '' said tim westergren .
former president barack obama offered his most pointed critique to date of president donald trump , delivering a lengthy and direct indictment friday of the last two years in american politics by arguing the president is `` capitalizing on resentment that politicians have been fanning for years . '' the speech before more than a thousand students at the university of illinois-urbana champaign was a preview of the message obama will carry into the midterm elections . but it also represented the former president 's most comprehensive condemnation of republicans in washington and the first time he has publicly criticized trump by name in a speech . `` you happen to be coming of age '' amid backlash to progress , obama told the students . early in his presidential campaign , obama stated that lobbyists `` wo n't find a job in my white house '' , but softened his stance after taking office . on january 21 , 2009 , obama issued an executive order for all future appointees to his administration , which ordered that no appointee who was a registered lobbyist within the two years before his appointment could participate on matters in which he lobbied for a period of two years after the date of appointment . three formal waivers were initially issued in early 2009 , out of 800 executive appointments : the citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington criticized the administration , claiming that obama retreated from his own ethics rules barring lobbyists from working on the issues about which they lobbied during the previous two years by issuing waivers . a 2015 politico investigation found that , while obama had instituted incremental reforms and the number of lobbyists fell during obama 's presidency , obama had failed to close the `` revolving door '' of officials moving between government and business . trump and obama frequently communicated during the transition period , and trump stated that he sought obama 's advice regarding presidential appointments . however , president-elect trump also criticized some of obama 's actions , including obama 's refusal to veto a un resolution condemning israel settlements . in his farewell address , obama expressed concerns about a divisive political environment , economic inequality , and racism , but remained optimistic about the future .
a 2005 rand corporation study found the un to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts . it compared un nation-building efforts to those of the united states , and found that seven out of eight un cases are at peace . also in 2005 , the human security report documented a decline in the number of wars , genocides and human rights abuses since the end of the cold war , and presented evidence , albeit circumstantial , that international activism -- mostly spearheaded by the un -- has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict since the end of the cold war . although it is situated in new york city , the land occupied by the united nations headquarters and the spaces of buildings that it rents are under the sole administration of the united nations and not the u.s. government . they are technically extraterritorial through a treaty agreement with the u.s. government . however , in exchange for local police , fire protection and other services , the united nations agrees to acknowledge most local , state , and federal laws . in october 2011 city and state officials announced an agreement in which the un would be allowed to build a long-sought new office tower just south of the existing campus on the current robert moses playground , which would be relocated . in exchange , the united nations would allow the construction of an esplanade along the east river that would complete the east river greenway , a waterfront pedestrian and bicycle pathway . while host nation authorities have agreed to the provisions of the plan , it needs the approval of the united nations in order to be implemented . the plan is similar in concept to an earlier proposal that had been announced in 2000 but did not move forward .
greenwood tulsa , also known as `` black wall street '' , was one of the most commercially successful and affluent majority african-american communities in the united states . booker t. washington referred to the greenwood neighborhood as `` negro wall street . '' many americans , including african-americans , had moved to oklahoma in hopes of gaining a shot at quick economic gains through the mining and oil industries . even though african-americans constituted a small percentage of the overall population in oklahoma , the percentage of african-americans in tulsa had significantly increased to around 12.3 percent during the oil boom . many african-americans had come from the deep south and kansas because of the opportunity to strike gold because of the rich oil fields . maude and george transformed greenwood farm into a self-sufficient home , making use of the land and barn for growing crops . the ohio agricultural extension service in 1912 , recommended a design that would provide the best yields and proper drainage for the farm . greenwood avenue in tulsa was important because it ran north for over a mile from the frisco railroad yards , and it was one of the few streets that did not cross through both black and white neighborhoods . the citizens of greenwood took pride in this fact because it was something they had all to themselves and did not have to share with the white community of tulsa . greenwood avenue was home to the black commercial district , whose many red brick buildings belonged to black americans and housed thriving businesses , including grocery stores , banks , libraries , and much more . greenwood was one of the most affluent african-american communities in the country , and became known as `` black wall street .

1 -rrb- where is obama 's second term agenda ? -- president barack obama 's thursday night nomination speech , now being held in the tight time warner cable arena due to weather concerns , needs to lay out a specific second-term agenda . for obama , simply promising more of the same is n't enough to earn re-election . he 's got to lay out a specific contrasting plan with some new details , because the curse of being barack obama is that giving a great speech is n't good enough anymore . president barack obama accepted his party 's nomination for re-election on thursday , telling the democratic national convention and americans that only the voters in november have the power to secure the change he started . in a tough speech that sounded now-familiar themes of his campaign , the president sought to show his supporters that their votes for him four years ago brought achievements that would be wiped out if republican challenger mitt romney wins the election two months away . `` if you turn away now -- if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for is n't possible , well , change will not happen , '' obama said , depicting a scenario in which special interests and conservative politicians run washington and the country . '' ... only you can make sure that does n't happen . president barack obama accepted the nomination of his party thursday on the last night of the democratic national convention , wrapping up a three-day political lovefest in charlotte , north carolina . obama 's acceptance speech was n't one of his best , but it was enough to send democrats infused with enthusiasm as they head home and hope it spreads there . here are five things we learned on thursday : 1 . obama clears the hurdle the president of the united states unleashed a corker of a convention speech on thursday night in charlotte .

at first , james horner was unsure if he could work on the film due to scheduling restrictions . then he watched a rough cut and was so moved that he accepted the job of scoring it . robinson had created a temp track which was disliked by universal executives . when the announcement of horner as composer was made , they felt more positive because they expected a big orchestral score , similar to horner 's work for an american tail . robinson and the producers did not originally consider kevin costner for the part of ray because they did not think that he would want to follow bull durham with another baseball film . he , however , did end up reading the script and became interested in the project , stating that he felt it would be `` this generation 's it 's a wonderful life '' . since robinson 's directing debut in the mood had been a commercial failure , costner also said that he would help him with the production . amy madigan , a fan of the book , joined the cast as ray 's wife , annie . variety 's owen gleiberman wrote , `` at once funny , scalding , and stirring , built around two bravura performances of incredible sharpness and humanity , it 's the work of a major film artist , one who shows that he can capture life in all its emotional detail and complexity -- and , in the process , make a piercing statement about how our society now works . '' alonso duralde of thewrap praised the performances and baumbach 's screenplay , saying , `` one wonders if baumbach left references to kramer vs. kramer or two for the road on the cutting-room floor , but either way , marriage story is a film that deserves to be mentioned in their company . it 's devastating , essential , and destined to be remembered long after this awards cycle ends .

bernie sanders ' campaign tried on thursday to distance the presidential candidate from a 1972 essay in which he wrote -- among other things -- a women `` fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously . '' michael briggs , sanders ' newly minted campaign spokesman , said the article was a `` dumb attempt at dark satire in an alternative publication '' that `` in no way reflects his views or record on women . '' `` it was intended to attack gender stereotypes of the '70s , but it looks as stupid today as it was then , '' briggs told cnn . the vermont senator is currently pursuing the 2016 democratic presidential nomination . sanders made his first national appearance following his heart attack on october 15 at the democratic debate , at which he said , `` i 'm healthy , i 'm feeling great . '' when asked how he would reassure voters about his health and ability to take on the duties of the presidency , he said , `` we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country . that is how i think i can reassure the american people . '' it was noted that he was `` lively and sharp at the debate . '' addressing the platform of the front-running republican candidate donald trump in an appearance on face the nation on december 27 , sanders said that `` any of trump 's supporters are working-class people and they 're angry , and they 're angry because they 're working longer hours for lower wages , they 're angry because their jobs have left this country and gone to china or other low-wage countries , they 're angry because they ca n't afford to send their kids to college so they ca n't retire with dignity '' . sanders said that while he believed these are legitimate fears , trump had `` converted them into anger against mexicans , anger against muslims '' rather than facing the real issue the american people need to confront , `` the greed of corporate america '' . sanders also noted that trump wanted more tax breaks for the wealthy and was opposed to an increase in the minimum wage .
as the presidential candidates head into their final day of campaigning , both president obama and mitt romney are focusing on the biggest prizes : the elusive swing states . cnn currently lists pennsylvania as likely to `` lean obama , '' but both campaigns are fighting for the keystone state . just one day after mitt romney took the stage in pennsylvania , president obama is deploying bill clinton to the state for four campaign states . sen. pat toomey -lrb- r-pa -rrb- , who campaigned with both romney and paul ryan this weekend , weighs in on the final push for his state on `` starting point '' today . the frenetic pace of presidential campaigning that has crested in the last few days -- in which the candidates or their surrogates hit 10 states -- wo n't end when voters go to the polls on tuesday . republican candidate mitt romney will campaign in two states on election day - ohio and pennsylvania - according to a romney campaign official . campaigning on election day , a senior romney adviser says , will help `` keep the energy going '' until the polls close . the idea is that the campaign is `` just going to keep working up until the polls close , '' said the same romney adviser . president barack obama and republican challenger mitt romney barnstormed their way across more than a half-dozen battleground states on sunday , making closing arguments to a closely divided american electorate before tuesday 's vote . obama stumped in new hampshire in the morning , flew to florida and ohio , and was headed west to colorado in the evening . romney spent sunday heading east from iowa to virginia , with a stop in ohio and a foray into pennsylvania in between . along the way , obama painted tuesday 's vote as a choice between policies that had moved the country out of the depths of recession and ones that got it into one in the first place .
members of congress make fact-finding missions to learn about other countries and stay informed , but these outings can cause controversy if the trip is deemed excessive or unconnected with the task of governing . for example , the wall street journal reported in 2009 that lawmaker trips abroad at taxpayer expense had included spas , $ 300-per-night extra unused rooms , and shopping excursions . lawmakers respond that `` traveling with spouses compensates for being away from them a lot in washington '' and justify the trips as a way to meet officials in other nations . advantages which incumbents enjoy over challengers , and which have been a source of criticism and controversy , are access to campaign contributions as well as gerrymandering which give incumbents an unfair advantage , according to some critics . as a result , re-election rates of members of congress seeking repeated terms hovers around 90 % according to many sources . sometimes members of congress are seen as a `` privileged class '' with cozy relations with lobbyists and free use of official resources . academics such as princeton 's stephen macedo have proposed solutions to fix gerrymandering . on august 2 , 2011 , the united states public debt was projected to reach its statutory maximum . without an increase in that limit the u.s. treasury would be unable to borrow money to pay its bills . although previous statutory increases have been routine , conservative members of the house refused to allow an increase without drastically reducing government spending . over several weeks and months , negotiators from both parties , both houses , and the white house worked to forge a compromise .

sen. rand paul was supposed to be on stage at monday night 's voters first forum in new hampshire . but the vote on his bill to defund planned parenthood made it impossible to get to the event in time . so instead , paul and sens. marco rubio and ted cruz found themselves in a television studio in washington , beamed in by satellite to appear with 11 other gop candidates at st. anselm . iowa has long been the must-win state for scott walker , but the growing threat of donald trump has the wisconsin governor 's team fortifying its battlements in the state . the super pac backing walker , unintimidated pac , told cnn wednesday that it was buying $ 7 million of air time in iowa and starting to saturate the airwaves in september , a major marker . the pac is also planning to announce buys soon in nevada , new hampshire and south carolina . walker has long led most polls of republican caucusgoers in iowa , starting from his breakout speech at the iowa freedom summit this past january . during the latter part of 2015 , rubio 's voting record in the senate came under scrutiny . jeb bush , during the cnbc debate on october 28 , told rubio that he could either campaign or resign , rubio responding that bush had not made similar comments about the voting record of john mccain during his 2008 presidential campaign and concluded that bush was only criticizing `` because we 're running for the same position and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you . '' in december , while in iowa , fellow presidential candidate chris christie mentioned rubio missing a vote on a national spending bill the senator opposed and added , `` just show up to work and vote no , and like if you do n't want to , then quit .

within the united states armed forces , according to an unscientific survey , the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections . while 73 percent of military personnel said they would vote for bush , 18 percent preferred his democratic rival , john kerry . according to peter feaver , a duke university political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the u.s. military , members of the armed services supported bush because they found him more likely than kerry to complete the war in iraq . in response to the september 11 terrorist attacks , bush launched a `` war on terror '' that began with the war in afghanistan in 2001 and later expanded to the iraq war in 2003 . signature legislation passed during his presidency included broad tax cuts , the patriot act , the no child left behind act , the partial-birth abortion ban act , the medicare modernization act , and funding for the aids relief program known as pepfar . in the 2004 presidential race , bush defeated democratic senator john kerry in a close election . after his re-election , bush received criticism from across the political spectrum for his handling of the iraq war , hurricane katrina , and other challenges . bush 's campaign cast him as a youthful , `` thinking man 's candidate '' who would emulate the pragmatic conservatism of president eisenhower . in the midst of the soviet -- afghan war , which brought an end to a period of détente , and the iran hostage crisis , in which 52 americans were taken hostage , the campaign highlighted bush 's foreign policy experience . at the outset of the race , bush focused heavily on winning the january 21 iowa caucuses , making 31 visits to the state . ultimately , he won a close victory iowa with 31.5 % to reagan 's 29.4 % .
during the 1980s , stampede wrestling featured a villainous commentator and manager by the name hugh hart . he was said to be a cousin of the hart family and would often ostracize stu hart over what he perceived as letting his children get away with bad behaviour . he also managed a team called `` the blackharts '' . he was nicknamed bizz -lrb- or biz -rrb- by his siblings . his sister diana has claimed that it was because he was always so busy with working on something , but his brother bret said in his autobiography that it was because he was always up to some mischievous business . as a child he once accidentally started a fire in the hart house while playing in the top floor . as a result , near the end of 1985 , stu hart decided to re-open the promotion with bruce running most of it . initially , the promotion , which had been hurt by the loss of most of its well-known wrestlers , struggled to remain afloat . as a consequence , bruce chose to feature a new , edgier and more hard core style of wrestling - featuring villains : the karachi vice -lrb- makhan and vokhan singh and the great gama -rrb- , the viet cong express -lrb- hiroshi hase and nubohiko niikura -rrb- jason the terrible , the masked zodiak -lrb- barry orton -rrb- and younger babyfaces , such as owen hart , ben bassarab , chris benoit , jushin thunder liger and the tag team badd company -lrb- bruce hart and brian pillman -rrb- . in short order , the promotion would survive for the next several years , drawing reasonable gates and turning out a number of performers who would go on to have decent careers in other companies after the promotion 's collapse .

sen. tim kaine mischaracterized the clinton foundation 's donation policy during a recent interview , saying it no longer accepts foreign and corporate money when , in fact , it has only pledged to renounce these sources of funding if hillary clinton is elected president . `` she is taking one step forward right now , the foundation is taking one step forward right now by saying there 's no corporations , no foreign-connected contributions taking right now , '' kaine told newsnet5 , an ohio television station monday . `` and then , if we are successful and are elected , president clinton will sever the tie with the foundation created . '' kaine 's comments are incorrect . for donald trump , this was supposed to be a week in which he established himself as the only presidential candidate fit to serve as commander in chief . but that 's not working out so easily for the republican presidential nominee . trump is back at the center of controversy following an nbc news forum wednesday in which he praised russian president vladimir putin , falsely asserted he opposed the iraq war , seemed to criticize us generals , politicized nonpartisan intelligence briefings and stood by a tweet that implied military sexual assault is the result of women in the armed forces . related : trump defends tweet on military sexual assault hillary clinton pounced on trump 's performance at the event , escalating the battle between the two candidates with less than three weeks before they appear on stage together for the first time to debate . hillary clinton has advantages heading into the final stretch of the campaign that any presidential candidate would envy : a fleet of popular surrogates , a mountain of cash and an opponent who is often sidetracked by self-inflicted wounds . yet the democratic nominee enters this home stretch in a dead heat against donald trump , according to a cnn/orc poll released tuesday . the close contest heading into the fall underscores clinton 's vulnerabilities on trust and honesty -- and her need to summon a relentless and efficient ground game , even if many of her voters are fueled more by revulsion toward trump than excitement about her . but in many ways , the nation 's changing demographics make this clinton 's race to lose .

james was ill while living in newport , but before his death , his brother benjamin franklin came for a visit . when benjamin left for philadelphia , he had with him his nephew , james jr. , and provided him with a printing apprenticeship thereafter . after a long illness , james died in newport in 1735 , on his 38th birthday and 12th wedding anniversary . james franklin was buried in the newport common burying ground and island cemetery . james franklin jeffrey -lrb- born february 8 , 1946 -rrb- currently serves as the united states special representative for syria engagement and the special envoy for the global coalition to defeat isil . he is a senior american diplomat and expert in political , security , and energy issues in the middle east , turkey , germany , and the balkans . franklin 's departure from vanderbilt was not without controversy , as his sudden move to penn state upset most of vanderbilt 's fans . in the days following the move to penn state ; on january 7 , 2014 james franklin was forced to discuss the gang rape allegations by four of his former players at vanderbilt . penn state university president rodney erickson and director of athletics dave joyner said a deep background search and intense interview questions left them confident that hiring franklin would not bring any more damage to penn state university , which was still working through the jerry sandusky child sex abuse scandal that damaged the program in 2011 .
the labour party had , for most of the 20th century , a commitment , based on the party 's historic opposition to class privilege , to abolish the house of lords , or at least expel the hereditary element . in 1968 the labour government of harold wilson attempted to reform the house of lords by introducing a system under which hereditary peers would be allowed to remain in the house and take part in debate , but would be unable to vote . this plan , however , was defeated in the house of commons by a coalition of traditionalist conservatives -lrb- such as enoch powell -rrb- , and labour members who continued to advocate the outright abolition of the upper house -lrb- such as michael foot -rrb- . as a check on the regional , popular , and rapidly changing politics of the house , the senate has several distinct powers . for example , the `` advice and consent '' powers -lrb- such as the power to approve treaties and confirm members of the cabinet -rrb- are a sole senate privilege . the house , however , has the exclusive power to initiate bills for raising revenue , to impeach officials , and to choose the president in the event that a presidential candidate fails to get a majority of the electoral college votes . the senate and house are further differentiated by term lengths and the number of districts represented : the senate has longer terms of six years , fewer members -lrb- currently one hundred , two for each state -rrb- , and -lrb- in all but seven delegations -rrb- larger constituencies per member . in july 2008 , jack straw , the secretary of state for justice and lord chancellor , introduced a white paper to the house of commons proposing to replace the house of lords with an 80 -- 100 % elected chamber , with one third being elected at each general election , for a term of approximately 12 -- 15 years . the white paper stated that as the peerage would be totally separated from membership of the upper house , the name `` house of lords '' would no longer be appropriate : it went on to explain that there is cross-party consensus for the new chamber to be titled the `` senate of the united kingdom '' ; however , to ensure the debate remains on the role of the upper house rather than its title , the white paper was neutral on the title of the new house .

'' and he said the fix wo n't involve statewide anti-discrimination protections for lgbt hoosiers . indiana 's top two state lawmakers pledged monday to amend the state 's controversial `` religious freedom '' law to clarify that it can not be used to discriminate against gay people . republicans david long and brian bosma , the state legislature 's senate president pro tempore and house speaker , respectively , insisted monday that the law would not and was not intended to allow discrimination against anyone . `` it is not the intent of the law to discriminate against anyone and it will not be allowed to discriminate against anyone , '' long said . `` to the extent that we need to clarify through legislative action that this law does not and will not be allowed to discriminate against anyone , we plan to do just that .

on july 27 , the first day of the cleveland browns ' training camp , free-agent center lecharles bentley suffered a season-ending knee injury during the first contact play of camp . bentley was quoted as saying , `` no one touched me . it was a freak thing . i took two steps , felt the injury and that was it . i suggest that it is time for criticism to leap to a new ground from which it can discover what the organizing or containing forms of its conceptual framework are . criticism seems to be badly in need of a coordinatingprinciple , a central hypothesis which , like the theory of evolution in biology , will see the phenomena it deals with as parts of a whole -lrb- anatomy 16 -rrb- . the browns came into the game hoping to rebound from the humiliating loss to the bengals . they came out strong , striking first with a touchdown pass from frye to braylon edwards , and an impressive defensive stop . the chiefs responded , however , and trent green tied the game up 7 -- 7 on a 22-yard pass to eddie kennison . they scored again 8 minutes later , this time a 9-yard td pass to tony gonzalez .

the president 's eldest son donald trump jr. downplayed monday a 2016 meeting between top campaign aides to his father and a russian lawyer , saying the highly scrutinized engagement `` ended up being about essentially nothing that was relevant '' to questions of collusion . the remarks , which came during a friendly interview on the laura ingraham show , came after president donald trump wrote on twitter the june 2016 meeting was intended to get damaging information on his democratic opponent hillary clinton -- contradicting a statement he dictated when the meeting came to light a year ago . in the interview monday , trump jr. said the session lasted 20 minutes , and maintained the central focus was on adoptions -- even as he conceded the clinton dirt was how the russian lawyers secured the meeting in the first place . '' -lrb- adoptions -rrb- was the primary thing that we had spoken about in the meeting , '' trump jr. said . president donald trump has been urged to stop tweeting about the 2016 trump tower meeting between trump 's top advisers and several russians , a source familiar with discussions tells cnn . the president was advised that his tweeting only gives oxygen to the topic , even if those around trump do not believe there is any truly new development . on sunday , trump tweeted an apparent response to stories by cnn and the washington post that said he is worried about donald trump jr. 's legal exposure following the infamous 2016 meeting . calling the reported concerns a `` complete fabrication , '' the president acknowledged that the meeting was accepted on the premise that trump jr. would get dirt on hillary clinton . president donald trump on sunday offered his starkest and most direct acknowledgment yet that his son , campaign chairman and son-in-law met with a russian lawyer to get dirt on hillary clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign . `` this was a meeting to get information on an opponent , totally legal and done all the time in politics -- and it went nowhere . i did not know about it ! '' trump tweeted on sunday .
following the 2018 congressional midterm elections which saw the election of a democratic party majority in the house of representatives , nancy pelosi was elected speaker when the 116th congress convened on january 3 , 2019 . when republican leader john boehner succeeded her as speaker in 2011 , pelosi remained the leader of the democratic party in the house of representatives and served as house minority leader for eight years before she led her party to victory in the 2018 elections . in addition to being the first woman to hold the office , pelosi became the first speaker to return to power since sam rayburn in the 1950s . as speaker , pelosi was still the leader of the house democrats ; the speaker is considered to be the leader of his or her house caucus . however , by tradition , she did not normally participate in debate and almost never voted on the floor , though she had every right to do so as a full house member . she was also not a member of any house committees . pelosi supported her longtime friend , john murtha of pennsylvania , for the position of house majority leader , the second-ranking post in the house democratic caucus . his competitor was house minority whip steny hoyer of maryland , who had been pelosi 's second-in-command since 2003 . pelosi and hoyer had a somewhat frosty relationship dating back to 2001 , when they ran against each other for minority whip . however , hoyer was elected as house majority leader over murtha by a margin of 149 -- 86 within the caucus .

it 's over . donald trump is the republican nominee . he just added nevada to the growing list of caucus primary wins , and while he needs more delegates to clinch it , who the heck can stop him now ? read : chris christie endorses trump he is leading in national polls and in many state polls ; he 's succeeded in upending rivals such as ted cruz , jeb bush and ben carson ; and there 's no one in sight who can stop him . local media , social media and sources on the ground in nevada are reporting ballot shortages and identifications going unchecked at tuesday 's republican caucuses . jeremy hughes , a nevada strategist for marco rubio , said he was hearing about extensive problems at caucus sites across the state . at his own caucus site in clark county , he said volunteers were checking in voters to caucus without checking their ids , including one member of the rubio team . hughes said he reported the violations to sue lowden , the former chairwoman of the nevada republican party who happened to be at that caucus site , and she reprimanded the woman . despite donald trump 's commanding win in the nevada caucus tuesday , republican national committee chairman reince priebus is holding off crowning the republican front-runner as the standard-bearer -- for now . `` i think it 's pretty clear we 're going to embrace whoever the nominee is . i embrace all of these candidates , '' he told cnn 's alisyn camerota wednesday on `` new day .

'' `` n immediate step we 're taking is to engage the limited number of clients we have that manufacture assault weapons for non-military use to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility , '' the statement reads . bank of america did not detail any concrete actions it plans to take , but the announcement is the latest sign that businesses are increasingly willing to put pressure on the gun industry . delta 's decision to cut ties with the nra could cost it a generous tax break from the state of georgia . the state 's republicans -- including a major candidate for governor -- are threatening to kill part of a bill that would eliminate a state tax on jet fuel . if it passes , the provision is expected to save the atlanta-based airline tens of millions of dollars . `` we felt that it was wrong for them to single out one company , '' said chuck hufstetler , chairman of the state 's senate finance committee . for a long time , companies avoided political controversies . now , their customers are pushing them to pick a side . activists are demanding that businesses weigh in on immigration , climate change and , most recently , gun control . the problem is , it 's hard to take a stand without getting burned .
during this period , columbia scored a top 40 hit with the pink floyd single `` another brick in the wall '' , and its parent album the wall would spend four months at no. 1 on the billboard lp chart in early 1980 , but few in the industry knew that dick asher was in fact using the single as a covert experiment to test the extent of the pernicious influence of the network - by not paying them to promote the new pink floyd single . the results were immediate and deeply troubling - not one of the major radio stations in los angeles would program the record , despite the fact that the group was in town , performing the first seven concerts on their elaborate the wall tour at the los angeles memorial sports arena to rave reviews and sold-out crowds . asher was already worried about the growing power of the network , and the fact it operated entirely outside the control of the label , but he was profoundly dismayed to realize that `` the network '' was in effect a huge extortion racket , and that the operation could well be linked to organized crime - a concern vehemently dismissed by yetnikoff , who resolutely defended the `` indies '' and declared them to be `` mensches '' . in november 1813 , the college agreed to incorporate its medical school with the college of physicians and surgeons , a new school created by the regents of new york , forming columbia university college of physicians and surgeons . : 53 -- 60 the college 's enrollment , structure , and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century , with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the college functioned . in 1857 , the college moved from the king 's college campus at park place to a primarily gothic revival campus on 49th street and madison avenue , where it remained for the next forty years . during the last half of the 19th century , under the leadership of president f.a.p. . when the british invasion arrived in january 1964 , columbia had no rock musicians on its roster except for dion , who was signed in 1963 as the label 's first major rock star , and paul revere & the raiders who were also signed in 1963 . the label released a merseybeat album , the exciting new liverpool sound -lrb- columbia cl-2172 , issued in mono only -rrb- . terry melcher , son of doris day , produced the hard driving `` do n't make my baby blue '' for frankie laine , who had gone six years without a hit record . the song reached no .

in november 2008 , two things led to an explosion in popularity of the obama comic book character . one of obama 's advisers gave an interview to journalist jon swaine of the daily telegraph titled , `` barack obama : the 50 facts you might not know . '' in the interview , it emerged that obama collects `` spider-man and conan the barbarian . '' then later that month , on november 4 , 2008 , obama became the first african-american to be elected president of the united states . on september 16 , 2016 , as the republican party presidential nominee , trump conceded that `` president barack obama was born in the united states . period . '' trump gave himself credit for putting the controversy to rest and also repeated a false claim that hillary clinton , his opponent in the 2016 u.s. presidential election and one of obama 's opponents in the 2008 democratic presidential primaries , had started the controversy concerning obama 's place of birth . while those who did so were clinton supporters , there is no evidence of clinton or her campaign questioning obama 's birthplace . the presidency of barack obama began at noon est on january 20 , 2009 , when barack obama was inaugurated as the 44th president of the united states , and ended on january 20 , 2017 . obama , a democrat from illinois , took office following a decisive victory over republican john mccain in the 2008 presidential election . four years later , in the 2012 election , he defeated republican mitt romney to win re-election . he was the first african american president , the first multiracial president , the first non-white president , and the first president to have been born in hawaii .
former president barack obama on monday met with swedish teenage climate activist greta thunberg as part of her visit to washington , dc , to promote environmental issues . `` just 16 , @gretathunberg is already one of our planet 's greatest advocates , '' obama tweeted after his meeting with thunberg . `` recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change , she 's unafraid to push for real action . '' thunberg established herself as a bona fide climate action figure after staging weekly sit-ins outside the swedish parliament , spawning a burgeoning movement of youth climate activists to hold their own protests in more than 100 cities worldwide . when president donald trump visits the un on monday , many of his fellow world leaders will be participating in a summit meant to address climate change . trump wo n't be there . instead , the president is chairing his own session focused on worldwide religious persecution . it 's the latest evidence of trump 's isolation on the climate issue with his fellow world leaders . president donald trump mocked swedish climate activist greta thunberg on twitter late monday night after the 16-year-old excoriated world leaders for not doing enough to tackle the climate crisis . `` she seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future . so nice to see ! '' trump posted on twitter , replying to a video of thunberg 's speech at the united nations climate action summit earlier in the day .
james e. talmage , a prominent writer and leader in the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints argued that the definitive article used in the new testament makes the title `` the son of man '' a distinguishing appellation exclusive to jesus . talmage supports the view of vermes , but adds to it the additional meaning that jesus is the son of an exalted man , subscribing to the church 's doctrine of exaltation . in this sense , too , the title is unique to jesus , as he is the only literal physical offspring of god the father . `` one time the disciples said , o jesus , son of mary , can your lord send down for us a table from heaven ? he said , fear god , if you are believers . they said , we want to eat of it , and that our hearts may be at peace , and we may know you have spoken truthfully and be among the witnesses to it . jesus , son of mary , said , o god our lord send down upon us a table from heaven , to be for us a festival , for the first of us and the last of us , and a sign from you : and give provision -lrb- of food -rrb- to us , for you are the best of providers . for centuries , the christological perspective on son of man has been a natural counterpart to that of son of god and in many cases affirms the humanity of jesus just as son of god affirms his divinity . in the 5th century , saint augustine viewed the duality of son of god and son of man in terms of the dual nature of christ in hypostatic union , in that the son of god became the son of man through the act of incarnation and wrote : `` since he is the only son of god by nature , he became also the son of man that he might be full of grace as well .

walgreens stores will no longer sell tobacco products to anyone under the age of 21 starting september 1 , the walgreens boots alliance announced tuesday . boots is the uk division of the company . the legal age to buy tobacco in both countries is currently 18 , but efforts to raise the limit to 21 are underway . in the uk , the all party parliamentary group on smoking and health recently called for a change in the legal age limit to achieve a `` smoke-free generation . '' walgreens defends its tobacco sales policy by reasoning that through selling tobacco in its outlets , it is more readily able to offer to customers advice and products for quitting smoking . as of december 2017 , walgreens changed its slogan from `` at the corner of happy and healthy '' and `` on your way to well '' to `` trusted since 1901 '' . as of january 1 , 2019 with the commonwealth-wide prohibition of the sale of tobacco and similar products in pharmacies , walgreens no longer sells those products in its massachusetts locations . charles r. walgreen jr. started out as a buyer for the company . as head of the company he increased the profit and size of the drug store , encouraged new lines of products to be sold and changed the format from counter service to self-service . he relinquished his role in company in 1969 to his son charles r. walgreen iii .
for the first time , central connecticut state university in new britain will hold its graduation exercises off campus . they will be at the hartford civic center may 28 . the reason : a space squeeze on campus . when the weather is good , commencement is at arute field , the school 's football stadium . central connecticut state university -lrb- central connecticut , ccsu , central connecticut state , or informally central -rrb- is a public university in new britain , connecticut . founded in 1849 as the state normal school , ccsu is connecticut 's oldest publicly funded university . ccsu is made up of four schools : the ammon college of liberal arts and social sciences ; the school of business ; the school of education and professional studies ; and the school of engineering , science , and technology . the university is attended by 11,822 students , 9,546 of whom are undergraduates , and 2,276 of whom are graduate students . the university 's daily student-run newspaper , the daily campus , is the largest student newspaper in the state of connecticut . the university has a huskyvision cable network , channels 14 and 16 at the university . channel 14 is uctv , a cable tv network consisting of student-made public-access television shows . the university also has a student-run community radio station , whus , which broadcasts at 91.7 fm from the uconn student union .
that month , clinton implemented a department of defense directive known as `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' , which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret . the act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual 's sexual orientation . the policy was developed as a compromise after clinton 's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent congressional republicans and democrats , including senators john mccain -lrb- r-az -rrb- and sam nunn -lrb- d-ga -rrb- . according to david mixner , clinton 's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with vice president al gore , who felt that `` the president should lift the ban ... even though was sure to be overridden by the congress '' . a few years after bill todman 's death in 1979 , goodson acquired the todman heirs ' share of the company , and in 1982 the company was renamed mark goodson productions . traditionally , shows would sign off with `` this is -lrb- announcer 's name -rrb- speaking for -lrb- show name -rrb- , a mark goodson-bill todman production/a mark goodson television production . '' after goodson 's death , to pay off a massive inheritance tax , goodson 's family sold the rights -lrb- except for concentration/classic concentration , which had been licensed from nbc -rrb- to all-american television , which was subsequently taken over by pearson plc -lrb- an educational publisher and communications company based in the united kingdom -rrb- , and , in turn , was acquired by rtl group -lrb- a division of bertelsmann -rrb- , to form fremantle , which now owns the rights to the library from mark goodson productions . the mark goodson productions name , logo , and announcement continued to be used for some shows until 2007 , when bob barker 's last episode of the price is right aired . after the iraq war began , clinton made trips to iraq and afghanistan to visit american troops stationed there . on a visit to iraq in february 2005 , clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well . observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces , she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular u.s. army by 80,000 soldiers to ease the strain . in late 2005 , clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from iraq would be a mistake , bush 's pledge to stay `` until the job is done '' was also misguided , as it gave iraqis `` an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves '' .
in january 2005 , free , democratic elections were held in iraq for the first time in 50 years . according to iraqi national security advisor mowaffak al-rubaie , `` this is the greatest day in the history of this country . '' bush praised the event as well , saying that the iraqis `` have taken rightful control of their country 's destiny '' . this led to the election of jalal talabani as president and nouri al-maliki as prime minister of iraq . in march 2008 , bush praised the iraqi government 's `` bold decision '' to launch the battle of basra against the mahdi army , calling it `` a defining moment in the history of a free iraq '' . he said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding general david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008 . he also praised the iraqis ' legislative achievements , including a pension law , a revised de-baathification law , a new budget , an amnesty law , and a provincial powers measure that , he said , set the stage for the iraqi elections . by july 2008 , american troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began , and due to increased stability in iraq , bush announced the withdrawal of additional american forces . more than 20 nations -lrb- most notably the united kingdom -rrb- , designated the `` coalition of the willing '' joined the united states in invading iraq . they launched the invasion on march 20 , 2003 . the iraqi military was quickly defeated . the capital , baghdad , fell on april 9 , 2003 .
by 1244 , seeing that all her attempts to dissuade thomas had failed , theodora sought to save the family 's dignity , arranging for thomas to escape at night through his window . in her mind , a secret escape from detention was less damaging than an open surrender to the dominicans . thomas was sent first to naples and then to rome to meet johannes von wildeshausen , the master general of the dominican order . thomas was held prisoner for almost one year in the family castles at monte san giovanni and roccasecca in an attempt to prevent him from assuming the dominican habit and to push him into renouncing his new aspiration . political concerns prevented the pope from ordering thomas 's release , which had the effect of extending thomas 's detention . thomas passed this time of trial tutoring his sisters and communicating with members of the dominican order . family members became desperate to dissuade thomas , who remained determined to join the dominicans . `` cookie run '' is a series of online mobile running games , with the most recent , non spin-off game being cookie run : ovenbreak , where you run with 101 cookies , 94 pets , and 64 treasures , all bearing a different number of points depending on the combi used . cookie run at the moment includes 6 modes , with other modes that will come and go for events . cookie trials is a mode where you run with certain combis out of the cookies collected , where you try to get the most points possible to move up the ranks , going from bronze to diamond . every time a new rank is reached , you will gain a new reward .
president donald trump launched a feud with the rev. al sharpton on monday , escalating a series of attacks on prominent black leaders and minority progressives . trump has recently called out minority lawmakers and leaders in an effort to define the democratic party and strengthen his base ahead of the 2020 presidential election . his morning tirade against sharpton , a longtime african-american activist , come after a weekend in which the president repeatedly assailed maryland democratic rep. elijah cummings , who is black , and the city of baltimore , parts of which lie in cummings ' district . president donald trump 's attacks on democratic rep. elijah cummings have n't gained as much internal support at the white house as his earlier attacks on the `` squad , '' according to administration officials . but there are no signs trump believes his strategy is wrong or is planning to pull back his attacks on the african american lawmaker from baltimore . one official confirmed that some aides express discomfort at the attacks , which do not appear to have been part of a larger strategy , during a monday staff meeting first reported by the new york times . instead , aides said trump has long expressed annoyance at cummings ' attempts to investigate members of the administration and identified baltimore as a target over the weekend . baltimore did not take president donald trump 's recent attack of the city lying down . instead , charm city was quick to stand up and fight back . trump lashed out at another prominent african american lawmaker on saturday , tweeting that his baltimore district is a `` disgusting , rat and rodent infested mess . '' the president 's tirade was directed at house oversight committee chairman elijah cummings , who represents maryland 's 7th congressional district in the house and recently lambasted conditions at the border .
cindy and holly move into the flat above the price slice convenience store . cindy is also offered a job at price slice , resulting in frankie osborne -lrb- helen pearson -rrb- getting sacked . this utterly displeases frankie since the osbornes are in a state of economic unrest . furthermore , when nancy osborne -lrb- jessica fox -rrb- discovers two and a half thousand pounds cash in an envelope , she becomes suspicious that her husband darren is gambling . pantone llc is a limited liability company headquartered in carlstadt , new jersey . the company is best known for its pantone matching system -lrb- pms -rrb- , a proprietary color space used in a variety of industries notably graphic design , fashion design , product design , printing and manufacturing and supporting the management of color from design to production , in physical and digital formats , among coated and uncoated materials , cotton , polyester , nylon and plastics . x-rite , a supplier of color measurement instruments and software , purchased pantone for $ 180 million in october 2007 , and was itself acquired by danaher corporation in 2012 . since 2000 , the pantone color institute has declared a particular color `` color of the year '' . twice a year the company hosts , in a european capital , a secret meeting of representatives from various nations ' color standards groups . after two days of presentations and debate , they choose a color for the following year ; for example , the color for summer 2013 was chosen in london in the spring of 2012 . the color purportedly connects with the zeitgeist ; for example , the press release declaring honeysuckle the color of 2011 said `` in times of stress , we need something to lift our spirits .
in november 2009 , then-representative nathan deal replied to a question about whether he believed that obama `` is a native-born american citizen who is eligible to serve as president '' with a statement that `` i am joining several of my colleagues in the house in writing a letter to the president asking that he release a copy of his birth certificate so we can have an answer to this question . '' contrasting the differing fates of deal , who won the 2010 gubernatorial election in georgia , and former democratic representative cynthia mckinney , who lost her primary after endorsing 9/11 conspiracy theories , david weigel of slate noted : `` dipping a toe into the birtherism fever swamp did n't stop deal from winning a statewide primary . '' a pregnant woman leaves her home to go overseas to have a child -- who there 's not a passport for -- so is in cahoots with someone ... to smuggle that child , that previously does n't exist on a government roll somewhere back into the country and has the amazing foresight to place birth announcements in the hawaii newspapers ? all while this is transpiring in cahoots with those in the border , all so some kid named barack obama could run for president 46 and a half years later . a specific new breed of american conspiracy theorists who believe that the real problem with barack obama being president is that he ca n't possibly have been born in the united states . he 's not eligible to be president . the birth certificate is a fake . he 's a foreigner .
donald trump says univision and nbc `` abandoned '' the 51 women vying for the miss usa crown by canceling the upcoming pageant telecast . organizers of the annual event , half-owned by trump and scheduled for july 12 , are arranging for a live-stream of the pageant now that the two networks have backed out of airing it . univision and nbc did so , they said , because of the offensive nature of trump 's comments about mexican immigrants . the broadcasters were facing sustained protests from hispanic leadership groups . univision is blasting a lawsuit brought by donald trump as `` both factually false and legally ridiculous . '' the billionaire businessman filed the $ 500 million lawsuit after the broadcaster decided not to air the miss usa pageant over trump 's widely criticized remarks about mexican immigrants . in a lengthy statement on tuesday , he accused univision of engaging in a `` politically motivated attempt to suppress mr. trump 's freedom of speech under the first amendment as he begins to campaign for the nation 's presidency . '' univision , america 's largest spanish-language broadcaster , announced last week that it will end its deal with the trump organization that gave the network the rights to broadcast miss usa in spanish . days after the miss usa pageant was dropped by univision and nbc , the july 12 event has found a new home on television , the reelz channel . reelz , a relatively obscure cable channel , saw an opportunity to fill the space left by nbc . it says it 's helping to `` save the sash . '' the miss usa organization is half owned by donald trump .
those who believed dean and angeli were deeply in love claimed that a number of forces led them apart . angeli 's mother disapproved of dean 's casual dress and what were , for her at least , unacceptable behavior traits : his t-shirt attire , late dates , fast cars , and the fact that he was not a catholic . her mother said that such behavior was not acceptable in italy . in addition , warner bros. , where he worked , tried to talk him out of marrying and he himself told angeli that he did not want to get married . also in 1991 , meyers contributed to the script for the ensemble comedy once upon a crime -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , directed by eugene levy , and became one out of several script doctors consulted to work on the whoopi goldberg comedy sister act -lrb- 1992 -rrb- . her next project with shyer was i love trouble -lrb- 1994 -rrb- , a comedy thriller about a cub reporter and a seasoned columnist who go after the same story , that was inspired by screwball comedies of the 1930s and 1940s such as his girl friday and woman of the year . written for and starring julia roberts and nick nolte , the film was not well received by critics but grossed over $ 30 million in box-office receipts in the united states . while the script for toast of the town , another meyers/shyer collaboration , that meyers described as `` a depression-era comedy about a small-town girl who comes to the big city , loses her values and then finds them again , '' found no buyers , another project called love crazy failed to materialize after lead actor hugh grant dropped out of the project after months of negotiations . `` looking to shoehorn the relationship into a convenient box , outsiders have called this meyers ' version of the blind side , but the comparison is inaccurate . the book and subsequent movie tell the story of michael oher , a boy who was homeless and did n't have much of a family life . meyers leonard has a family . it has not abandoned him .
the postwar years brought moderate growth to the city , as events on the u.c. campus began to build up to the recognizable activism of the sixties . in the 1950s , mccarthyism induced the university to demand a loyalty oath from its professors , many of whom refused to sign the oath on the principle of freedom of thought . in 1960 , a u.s. house committee -lrb- huac -rrb- came to san francisco to investigate the influence of communists in the bay area . berkeley is home to the oldest campus in the university of california system , the university of california , berkeley , and the lawrence berkeley national laboratory , which is managed and operated by the university . it also has the graduate theological union , one of the largest religious studies institutions in the world . berkeley is considered one of the most socially liberal cities in the united states . the city of berkeley has seen a consistent rise in the number of chronically homeless individuals over the past 30 years , and has implemented a number of different projects to reduce the number of people living on the streets . in 2008 , the city focused its efforts on addressing chronic homelessness . this led to a 48 % decline in the number of chronically homeless individuals reported in the 2009 berkeley pit . however , the number of `` hidden homeless '' individuals -lrb- those coping with housing insecurity by staying at a friend or relative 's residence -rrb- , increased significantly , likely in response to rising housing costs and costs of living .
in september 2006 , abc news reported that several hershey chocolate products were reformulated to replace cocoa butter with vegetable oil as an emulsifier . according to the company , this change was made to reduce the costs of producing the products instead of raising their prices or decreasing the sizes . some consumers complained that the taste was different , but the company stated that in the company-sponsored blind taste tests , about half of consumers preferred the new versions . as the new versions no longer met the food and drug administration 's official definition of `` milk chocolate '' , the changed items were relabeled from stating they were `` milk chocolate '' and `` made with chocolate '' to `` chocolate candy '' and `` chocolatey . '' hershey representatives have been responding to the group 's messages . at first , customer service told consumers that it was deliberate so the pieces did not fall off after production , but now , they say the company is looking into the cause . in a statement , jeff beckman , a hershey spokesman , said , `` we love our kisses as much as our consumers . we make more than 70 million kisses a day here in hershey , pa , and we want each of them looking as great as they taste . this is a list of products manufactured by the hershey company . some of these products began production over 100 years ago such as the hershey kiss and hershey bar . hershey produces a variety of products that are chocolate or candy based , and the hershey company also produces gum . this list excludes licensed items such as ice cream and chocolate milk , which are made by breyers , good humor , klondike , and natrel .
after the meeting , the queen issued a rare first-person statement on family matters , saying they had `` very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family '' , and that `` my family and i are entirely supportive of harry and meghan 's desire to create a new life as a young family '' . the statement concluded there was agreement to `` a period of transition in which the sussexes will spend time in canada and the uk '' , and that `` i have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days '' . the queen was praised for her swift handling of the crisis . seated again on the chair of estate , elizabeth then took the coronation oath as administered by the archbishop of canterbury . in the lengthy oath , the queen swore to govern each of her countries according to their respective laws and customs , to mete out law and justice with mercy , to uphold protestantism in the united kingdom and protect the church of england and preserve its bishops and clergy . she proceeded to the altar where she stated , `` the things which i have here promised , i will perform , and keep . so help me god '' , before kissing the bible and putting the royal sign-manual to the oath as the bible was returned to the dean of westminster . from the altar , the dean passed to the lord great chamberlain the spurs , which were presented to the queen and then placed back on the altar . the sword of state was then handed to elizabeth , who , after a prayer was uttered by fisher , placed it herself on the altar , and the peer who had been previously holding it took it back again after paying a sum of 100 shillings . the queen was then invested with the armills -lrb- bracelets -rrb- , stole royal , robe royal and the sovereign 's orb , followed by the queen 's ring , the sovereign 's sceptre with cross and the sovereign 's sceptre with dove . with the first two items on and in her right hand and the latter in her left , queen elizabeth was crowned by the archbishop of canterbury , with the crowd chanting `` god save the queen ! ''
as death succeeded death , dickinson found her world upended . in the fall of 1884 , she wrote that `` the dyings have been too deep for me , and before i could raise my heart from one , another has come . '' that summer she had seen `` a great darkness coming '' and fainted while baking in the kitchen . she remained unconscious late into the night and weeks of ill health followed . charlotte brontë remains the primary source of information about emily , although as an elder sister , writing publicly about her only shortly after her death , she is considered by certain scholars not to be a neutral witness . stevie davies believes that there is what might be called charlotte 's smoke-screen and argues that emily evidently shocked her , to the point where she may even have doubted her sister 's sanity . after emily 's death , charlotte rewrote her character , history and even poems on a more acceptable -lrb- to her and the bourgeois reading public -rrb- model . charlotte presented emily as someone whose `` natural '' love of the beauties of nature had become somewhat exaggerated owing to her shy nature , portraying her as too fond of the yorkshire moors , and homesick whenever she was away . some of my friends are gone , and some of my friends are sleeping -- sleeping the churchyard sleep -- the hour of evening is sad -- it was once my study hour -- my master has gone to rest , and the open leaf of the book , and the scholar at school alone , make the tears come , and i can not brush them away ; i would not if i could , for they are the only tribute i can pay the departed humphrey .
over the next century the library grew to become the largest in america , but on january 24 , 1764 , a major fire destroyed almost all of harvard 's books and scientific instruments . all of the books in the library at the time of the fire were completely burned . the books that had been loaned out when the fire occurred were the only portion of the collection that remained . books and donations were offered by friends of the college to replace its collections . harvard university is a private ivy league research university in cambridge , massachusetts , with about 6,800 undergraduate students and about 14,000 postgraduate students . established in 1636 and named for its first benefactor , clergyman john harvard , harvard is the united states ' oldest institution of higher learning . its history , influence , wealth , and academic reputation have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.the harvard corporation , chartered in 1650 , is the governing body of harvard . in its early years , harvard college primarily trained congregational and unitarian clergy , although it has never been formally affiliated with any denomination . in 1846 , the natural history lectures of louis agassiz were acclaimed both in new york and on the campus at harvard college . agassiz 's approach was distinctly idealist and posited americans ' `` participation in the divine nature '' and the possibility of understanding `` intellectual existences . '' agassiz 's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the `` divine plan '' in all phenomena . when it came to explaining life-forms , agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence .
this original nancy is frequently outspoken and authoritative , so much so that edward stratemeyer told benson that the character was `` much too flip , and would never be well received . '' the editors at grosset & dunlap disagreed , but benson also faced criticism from her next stratemeyer syndicate editor , harriet adams , who felt that benson should make nancy 's character more `` sympathetic , kind-hearted and lovable . '' adams repeatedly asked benson to , in benson 's words , `` make the sleuth less bold ... ` nancy said ' became ` nancy said sweetly , ' ` she said kindly , ' and the like , all designed to produce a less abrasive , more caring type of character . '' many readers and commentators , however , admire nancy 's original outspoken character . at bottom , says mason , the character of nancy drew is that of a girl who is able to be `` perfect '' because she is `` free , white , and sixteen '' and whose `` stories seem to satisfy two standards -- adventure and domesticity . but adventure is the superstructure , domesticity the bedrock . '' young nancy was a difficult baby , throwing crying fits and temper tantrums late into childhood . at three months old , she was prescribed a liquid barbiturate by a pediatrician , but her violent behavior persisted . in an interview , deborah spungen stated , `` i know it 's normal for babies to scream , but nancy did nothing but scream . ''
it 's been 15 years since steve owings lost his son to a speeding tractor trailer , which barreled into the college senior 's car while he was on his way back to school . ever since , owings has been pushing for a new federal rule that would require devices limiting large trucks to a top speed of 65 miles per hour . the american trucking association , representing most of the industry , agreed ; most new trucks already had built-in speed limiters . the obama administration came out with a draft version in 2016 , and went through the required comment period . more recently , peter elbow , in his book writing without teachers , presents a very different view of the drafting stage in the writing process . he describes his stance on the writing process , saying `` writing is a way to end up thinking something you could n't have started out thinking . '' according to elbow , the best way to accomplish this is a series of drafts which come together to produce an emerging `` center of gravity '' that then translates into the main focus on the work . this process should be a holistic process , not a linear process . elbow 's reasoning behind this concept of multiple drafts follows the idea that , `` if he learns to maximize the interaction among his own ideas or points of view , he can produce new ones that did n't seem available to him . '' in a book that became popular in the 1950s , the elements of style , famed authors strunk and white describe the first draft as being a less edited version of the final draft . in their book , strunk and white say , `` the first principle of composition is to foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape . '' this shape is the draft that eventually becomes the finished work .
lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in north america and europe , and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the united states . of cases reported to the united states cdc , the ratio of lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons . in the ten states where lyme disease is most common , the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005 . latex condoms , when used consistently and correctly , are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of hiv , the virus that causes aids . in addition , consistent and correct use of latex condoms reduces the risk of other sexually transmitted diseases -lrb- stds -rrb- , including diseases transmitted by genital secretions , and to a lesser degree , genital ulcer diseases . condom use may reduce the risk for genital human papillomavirus -lrb- hpv -rrb- infection and hpv-associated diseases , e.g. , genital warts and cervical cancer . there are two primary ways that stds are transmitted . coinfections complicate lyme symptoms , especially diagnosis and treatment . it is possible for a tick to carry and transmit one of the coinfections and not borrelia , making diagnosis difficult and often elusive . the centers for disease control and prevention studied 100 ticks in rural new jersey , and found 55 % of the ticks were infected with at least one of the pathogens .
the roman empire -lrb- latin : imperium rōmānum , classical latin : ; koinē greek : βασιλεία τῶν ῥωμαίων , romanized : basileía tōn rhōmaíōn -rrb- was the post-republican period of ancient rome . as a polity it included large territorial holdings around the mediterranean sea in europe , north africa and west asia ruled by emperors . from the accession of caesar augustus to the military anarchy of the third century , it was a principate with italy as metropole of the provinces and its city of rome as sole capital -lrb- 27 bc -- 286 ad -rrb- . although fragmented briefly during the military crisis , the empire was forcibly reassembled , then ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the western roman empire -lrb- based in milan and later in ravenna -rrb- and over the eastern roman empire -lrb- based in nicomedia and later in constantinople -rrb- . the byzantine empire , also referred to as the eastern roman empire , or byzantium , was the continuation of the roman empire in its eastern provinces during late antiquity and the middle ages , when its capital city was constantinople -lrb- modern istanbul , formerly byzantium -rrb- . it survived the fragmentation and fall of the western roman empire in the 5th century ad and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the ottoman turks in 1453 . during most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural and military force in europe . `` byzantine empire '' is a term created after the end of the realm ; its citizens continued to refer to their empire simply as the roman empire -lrb- greek : βασιλεία ῥωμαίων , tr . the ottoman turks -lrb- or osmanlı turks , turkish : osmanlı türkleri -rrb- were the turkish-speaking people of the ottoman empire -lrb- c. 1299 -- 1922/1923 -rrb- . reliable information about the early history of ottoman turks remains scarce , but they take their turkish name , osmanlı -lrb- `` osman '' became corrupted in some european languages as `` ottoman '' -rrb- , from the house of osman i -lrb- reigned c. 1299 -- 1326 -rrb- , the founder of the dynasty that ruled the ottoman empire for its entire 624 years . expanding from its base in bithynia , the ottoman principality began incorporating other turkish-speaking muslims and non-turkish christians . crossing into europe from the 1350s , coming to dominate the mediterranean and capturing -lrb- 1453 -rrb- constantinople -lrb- the capital city of the byzantine empire -rrb- , the ottoman turks blocked all major land routes between asia and europe ; western europeans had to find other ways to trade with the east - and vice versa .
lasker had an inquiring mind about what advertising was and how it worked . lasker believed that advertising consisted of news and information was news , he changed his mind when a colleague johnny kennedy told him , `` news is a technique of presentation , but advertising is a very simple thing . i can give it to you in three words , it is ` salesmanship in print ' '' . lasker and kennedy used this concept with the 1900 washer co. -lrb- later whirlpool -rrb- . in 1911 , the woodbury soap company became the first to use images of sexual contact to sell a product . their ad slogan , created by helen lansdowne , claimed that women who used the soap would have `` skin you love to touch '' . her copy promised the soap would increase the beauty of one 's skin ; it offered a color print and a week 's supply of the soap for 10 cents . the slogan became so popular that woodbury used it until the 1940s . contrary to popular belief , the chrysler corporation was never involved in the construction or ownership of the chrysler building , although it was built and designed for the corporation and served as its headquarters until the mid-1950s . it was a project of walter p. chrysler for his children . in his autobiography , chrysler wrote that he wanted to erect the building `` so that his sons would have something to be responsible for '' .

'' in response , clinton remarked , ` it was news to me and neither i nor my campaign approve of that , and it will certainly not be tolerated . ' ''

film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for best picture , in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season . the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified . it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders . for example , a producer of the 2009 best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner -lrb- the hurt locker eventually won -rrb- . the notion of the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences -lrb- ampas -rrb- began with louis b. mayer , head of metro-goldwyn-mayer -lrb- mgm -rrb- . he said he wanted to create an organization that would mediate labor disputes without unions and improve the industry 's image . he met with actor conrad nagel , director fred niblo , and the head of the association of motion picture producers , fred beetson to discuss these matters . the idea of this elite club having an annual banquet was discussed , but no mention of awards at that time . the academy award for best original song is one of the awards given annually to people working in the motion picture industry by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences -lrb- ampas -rrb- . it is presented to the songwriters who have composed the best original song written specifically for a film . the performers of a song are not credited with the academy award unless they contributed either to music , lyrics or both in their own right . the songs that are nominated for this award are performed during the ceremony and before this award is presented .
prawer served as chief editor of the encyclopaedia hebraica from 1967 onwards , with volume 21 the first to be published under his tenure . he advised and helped shape the tower of david museum of the history of jerusalem , and was asked to advise the government on cultural agreements with other countries . manuscripts were produced and illustrated in workshops housing italian , french , english and local craftsmen leading to a cross-fertilisation of ideas and techniques . an example of this is the melisende psalter , created by several hands in a workshop attached to the holy sepulchre . this style could have both reflected and influenced the taste of patrons of the arts . but what is seen is an increase in stylised , byzantine-influenced content . one of prawer 's best known works is the histoire du royaume latin de jérusalem , which wonhim the prix gustave schlumberger of the académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres . the two-volume work presents the crusader states as a working immigrant society , and shows the importance of immigration and labor shortages . another book by prawer , the latin kingdom of jerusalem : european colonialism in the middle ages , which was intended for a larger audience , was more controversial . in it , he portrays the crusaders as a society of frankish immigrants living in complete political and social segregation from the local muslim and syro-christian population , and terms this phenomenon `` apartheid '' .
in 1934 , with membership at a low of 3,500 , and with the nation in the throes of the great depression , john h. baker became the nas president . baker , a world war i aviator and ardent bird lover , was also a businessman , and he set about to invigorate the society and bolster its budget prosperity through publication . baker 's innovation was to begin publishing book-length descriptive and illustrated field guides on major forms of bird and mammal life . soon , in association with new york publisher alfred a. knopf , the audubon field guides became a staple of every artist 's and environmentalist 's library . in 1895 , the first audubon society was created . cousins and boston socialites harriet hemenway and minna b. hall , disturbed by the destruction left by plume hunters , organized a series of afternoon teas with other wealthy local women , encouraging them to avoid feathered garments . they also sent literature asking these women to , in hall 's words , `` join a society for the protection of birds , especially the egret . '' due to rising tensions with the british , president jefferson ordered an embargo on british trade in 1808 , adversely affecting audubon 's trading business . in 1810 , audubon moved his business further west to the less competitive henderson , kentucky , area . he and his small family took over an abandoned log cabin . in the fields and forests , audubon wore typical frontier clothes and moccasins , having `` a ball pouch , a buffalo horn filled with gunpowder , a butcher knife , and a tomahawk on his belt . ''
during the 1870s and 1880s , native american tribes were effectively excluded from the national park . under a half-dozen tribes had made seasonal use of the yellowstone area , but the only year-round residents were small bands of eastern shoshone known as `` sheepeaters '' . they left the area under the assurances of a treaty negotiated in 1868 , under which the sheepeaters ceded their lands but retained the right to hunt in yellowstone . the united states never ratified the treaty and refused to recognize the claims of the sheepeaters or any other tribe that had used yellowstone . the nez perce band associated with chief joseph , numbering about 750 people , passed through yellowstone national park in thirteen days during late august 1877 . they were being pursued by the u.s. army and entered the national park about two weeks after the battle of the big hole . some of the nez perce were friendly to the tourists and other people they encountered in the park ; some were not . nine park visitors were briefly taken captive . native americans have lived in the yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years . aside from visits by mountain men during the early-to-mid-19th century , organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s . management and control of the park originally fell under the jurisdiction of the secretary of the interior , the first being columbus delano . however , the u.s. army was subsequently commissioned to oversee management of yellowstone for a 30-year period between 1886 and 1916 .
years later , bill clinton expressed his continued anger about the foster rumors and theories , clenching a fist as he spoke : `` i heard a lot of the right-wing talk show people ... and all the sleazy stuff they said . they did n't give a rip that he had killed himself or that his family was miserable or that they could break the hearts . it was just another weapon to slug us with , to dehumanize us with . '' detective jason foster goes undercover to take down a crime ring that has been impenetrable by the police department for years . however , foster finds himself drawn in by the unique persona of ringleader stephen `` deuces '' brooks and the dual life that he leads . the mission is further complicated when foster 's sister janet also falls under deuce 's spell . margulies sent the completed script to james ponsoldt , his former student at yale university and a sundance award -- winning director . the new york times has described him as `` a devoted david foster wallace fan himself .

on september 18 , 2011 , netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its dvd-by-mail service as qwikster . ceo reed hastings justified the decision , stating that `` we realized that streaming and dvd by mail are becoming two quite different businesses , with very different cost structures , different benefits that need to be marketed differently , and we need to let each grow and operate independently . '' it was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals . the decision to split the services was widely criticized ; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other -lrb- with ratings , reviews , and queues not carrying over between them -rrb- , and would have required separate user accounts . on october 11 , 2017 , the baltimore sun reported that house of cards had been renewed for a sixth season and that filming would begin by the end of october 2017 . on october 29 , actor anthony rapp publicly stated that lead actor spacey had made a sexual advance on him at a 1986 party when rapp was 14 . the following day , netflix announced that the upcoming sixth season of house of cards would be its last . multiple sources stated that the decision to end the series was made prior to rapp 's accusation , but the announcement nevertheless caused suspicions for its timing . in 2014 , opinion blogger felix salmon wrote that netflix could n't `` afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch '' . he cited as evidence the company 's loss of rights to stream several major movies . according to journalist megan mcardle , the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company ; specifically , she said that '' movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place '' .
a u.s. national security official , who was not named , told reuters that '' ` this was a kill operation ' , making clear there was no desire to try to capture bin laden alive in pakistan '' . another source referencing a `` kill '' -lrb- rather than `` capture '' -rrb- order stated , `` officials described the reaction of the special operators when they were told a number of weeks ago that they had been chosen to train for the mission . ` they were told , `` we think we found osama bin laden , and your job is to kill him , '' ' an official recalled . `` the seals started to cheer . '' the associated press reported at the time two u.s. officials as stating the operation was `` a kill-or-capture mission , since the u.s. does n't kill unarmed people trying to surrender '' , but that `` it was clear from the beginning that whoever was behind those walls had no intention of surrendering '' . white house counterterrorism advisor john o. brennan said after the raid : `` if we had the opportunity to take bin laden alive , if he did n't present any threat , the individuals involved were able and prepared to do that . '' cia director leon panetta said on pbs newshour : `` the authority here was to kill bin laden . ... obviously under the rules of engagement , if he in fact had thrown up his hands , surrendered and did n't appear to be representing any kind of threat , then they were to capture him . in the decade following his disappearance , there were many attempts made by the united states government to locate bin laden . in december , 2009 , u.s. army general stanley mcchrystal said that bin laden would need to be `` captured or killed '' in order for the u.s. to `` finally defeat al-qaeda . '' according to the u.s. government 's official account of the operation , in august 2010 the u.s. central intelligence agency located a compound in abbottabad in pakistan and identified it as the likely location of bin laden thanks to the efforts of officer jay mcpherson . on may 1 , 2011 , united states navy seals of the naval special warfare development group -lrb- devgru -rrb- carried out an assault on the compound on orders from u.s. president barack obama .

'' president barack obama is back on the campaign trail , skewering several top republicans at a monday news conference in ethiopia , where he dubbed their rhetoric `` outrageous '' and `` sad .

in 2017 , the pa government imposed its own sanctions against gaza , including , among other things , cutting off salaries to thousands of pa employees , as well as financial assistance to hundreds of families in the gaza strip . the pa initially said it would stop paying for the electricity and fuel that israel supplies to the gaza strip , but after a year partially backtracked . the israeli government has allowed millions of dollars from qatar to be funneled on a regular basis through israel to hamas , to replace the millions of dollars the pa had stopped transferring to hamas . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu explained that letting the money go through israel meant that it could n't be used for terrorism , saying `` now that we are supervising , we know it 's going to humanitarian causes '' . the language of war leaves something lost in translation . israeli defense minister moshe ya'alon on saturday spoke of `` achievements '' and the destruction of `` significant targets '' in his country 's airstrikes against hamas targets in gaza . but on the ground in gaza , sources talked with cnn not about military targets , but about hospitals pushed to the brink , dead or distressed children , and airstrikes that struck water infrastructure . `` no one is talking about the palestinian civilians . gaza 's night skies were illuminated friday by clashes between israeli forces and hamas militants throughout the 27-mile-long palestinian territory . with fighting reported all along the coastal enclave , casualties poured into gaza city 's shifaa hospital , including children , after israeli artillery shelled east of the city , physicians told the hamas-run al-aqsa tv . the conflict raged for a second night and came after prime minister benjamin netanyahu warned earlier in the day that ground troops are prepared to expand an offensive against hamas militants . palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas will travel saturday or sunday to qatar , `` where we 're exerting every possible effort in order to do one thing : stop this bloodshed , '' said chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat .

boeing agreed to deliver the first 747 to pan am by the end of 1969 . the delivery date left 28 months to design the aircraft , which was two-thirds of the normal time . the schedule was so fast-paced that the people who worked on it were given the nickname `` the incredibles '' . developing the aircraft was such a technical and financial challenge that management was said to have `` bet the company '' when it started the project . the huge cost of developing the 747 and building the everett factory meant that boeing had to borrow heavily from a banking syndicate . during the final months before delivery of the first aircraft , the company had to repeatedly request additional funding to complete the project . had this been refused , boeing 's survival would have been threatened . the firm 's debt exceeded $ 2 billion , with the $ 1.2 billion owed to the banks setting a record for all companies . developing the 747 had been a major challenge , and building its assembly plant was also a huge undertaking . boeing president william m. allen asked malcolm t. stamper , then head of the company 's turbine division , to oversee construction of the everett factory and to start production of the 747 . to level the site , more than four million cubic yards -lrb- three million cubic meters -rrb- of earth had to be moved . time was so short that the 747 's full-scale mock-up was built before the factory roof above it was finished .
barry sullivan redefined the term `` leading man '' , being neither a genuine star , although billed above the title , nor a character actor , since he was seldom called upon to play anyone but himself - nice and reliable , the old standby . there were many others of his generation competing for the same roles - wendell corey , with his somewhat charming gloom , the cynical but easygoing van heflin , the acquiescent but dangerous robert ryan . many cinemagoers found the sullivans and ryans more rewarding than the bona fide box-office champs but , like them , they could be counted upon when it came to facing up to the great ladies of the screen . the hype for come play with me also spread to the letters pages of sullivan 's magazines . a fan letter of dubious authenticity -lrb- as it refers to scenes that do not appear in the film -rrb- from `` bert u '' to mary millington in issue 27 of whitehouse claims : `` dear mary , i must congratulate you on your film come play with me , i found it screamingly funny and very sexy as well ... i loved every randy moment ... everyone was so natural , and henry mcghee as the pm was superb . '' the letter goes on to falsely claim that the actor roy kinnear appears in the film , and that '' -lrb- roy -rrb- looked like a roman emperor in the swimming pool scene . i ` ll bet it took him all his time to keep his towel on during rehearsals for the film ... it looked to me , mary , as though you were fucked rigid during the film '' . in december 2019 , it was reported by the sun that rita would feature in a big storyline over christmas . producer ian macleod relished the chance to give barbara knox the spotlight after all of these decades in weatherfield . `` it 's a really good story actually and barbara knox , as is always the case , if you give her something big to do she nails it , '' he said . `` i 'm not saying that with any hint of surprise in my voice , she 's been doing it for decades .

when group eccentric mary -lrb- mary pat gleason -rrb- passes away unexpectedly during a meeting , the rest of the group is left to cope in various different ways : jill throws an over-the-top memorial , christy uses her legal skills to try and get mary 's grandson out of jail , tammy fears that marjorie will die next , bonnie is distraught because the last thing she said to mary was something mean , and wendy becomes a shut-in after feeling that her friends do n't care about her . bonnie invites her troubled aa sponsee patty to spend christmas with her and christy . while the combination of patty 's sad family status and christy 's stories of bonnie 's holiday mayhem and neglect drive bonnie into a horrified , tearful reflection on her past self , she is able to pull herself out of it and do good work in the present . elsewhere , jill annoyingly obsesses over a picture andy sent from his visit to minnesota . later , the group decides to join wendy for some therapeutic caroling . christy has gone back to school and is pursuing her dream of becoming a lawyer , while bonnie attempts to have a healthy romantic relationship with her new husband , adam -lrb- william fichtner -rrb- . through it all , christy and bonnie rely on their support system from aa , including the wise marjorie -lrb- mimi kennedy -rrb- , the wealthy and sometimes misguided jill -lrb- jaime pressly -rrb- , the overly-emotional wendy -lrb- beth hall -rrb- , and the loudmouthed but sweet tammy -lrb- kristen johnston -rrb- . collectively , they help each other stay sober in the face of whatever life throws at them .

though views differ as respects the impact of title ix , discussion typically focuses on whether or not title ix has resulted in increased athletic opportunities for females , and whether and to what extent title ix has resulted in decreased athletic opportunities for males . title ix has played a large role in females getting more involved in the cheerleading world , their goal has been to see an increase in females ' participation in athletics , so the main focus was put on the gender equality of school athletics . athletic equality requirements that schools must meet were made , the requirements were set by the u.s. department of education office of civil rights and to meet the requirements , schools must pass at least one of three tests measuring gender equality among athletics the school offers . these tests consist of proportional numbers of males and females participating , whether or not the school is making an effort to increase the number of the unrepresented sex , or if the school has a certain history of one specific sex dominating numbers in a sport , the school is showing an effort to expand the program to the other sex.although title ix has increased the participation of female students , there is a struggle for professional females as there has been a decrease in opportunities and females ' role in coaching has majorly decreased while males have gained a larger role in directing athletics , which is still a struggle for women today . there are also a large number and wide variety of publicly and privately administered institutions of higher education throughout the country . post-secondary education , divided into college , as the first tertiary degree , and graduate school , is described in a separate section below . higher education includes elite private colleges like harvard university , stanford university , mit , and caltech , large state flagship universities , private liberal arts schools , historically-black colleges and universities , community colleges , and for-profit colleges like the university of phoenix . college enrollment rates in the united states have increased over the long term . economics professor alan zagier blames credential inflation for the admission of so many unqualified students into college . he reports that the number of new jobs requiring college degrees is less than the number of college graduates . he states that the more money that a state spends on higher education , the slower the economy grows , the opposite of long held notions . other studies have shown that the level of cognitive achievement attained by students in a country -lrb- as measured by academic testing -rrb- is closely correlated with the country 's economic growth , but that `` increasing the average number of years of schooling attained by the labor force boosts the economy only when increased levels of school attainment also boost cognitive skills .

'' about 2/3 -lrb- 65.5 % -rrb- of those surveyed thought that creationism was definitely or probably true . in 2005 a newsweek poll discovered that 80 percent of the american public thought that `` god created the universe .

george zimmerman , from his comments to police to the arguments of his lawyers , has steadfastly maintained he should n't be found guilty of murder in the death of trayvon martin , contending he shot the teen in self-defense . but jurors weighing his fate wo n't hear that from him directly . on wednesday afternoon , judge debra nelson asked zimmerman if he 'd made a decision about taking the stand in his own defense . `` after consulting with counsel , '' zimmerman replied , he 'd decided `` not to testify , your honor . '' the florida judge presiding over george zimmerman 's murder trial ruled monday that jurors will be allowed to hear about marijuana found in trayvon martin 's system the night he was fatally shot . prosecutors argued the amount was so minimal that `` we just do n't know '' what effect it had on martin . they also accused the defense of trying to `` backdoor some very negative character evidence '' into the trial . but the defense said the amount found in martin 's system would have affected his judgment that night and is therefore relevant to the case . prosecutor john guy delivered the state 's rebuttal argument after the defense finished their closing argument . guy told the jury that in order to know what happened that night , they should look `` into the heart of the grown man and the heart of the child . '' guy also argued to the jurors that if zimmerman had done what he was supposed to do , none of us would be here . guy also said that if zimmerman had really wanted the police to get martin , he would have stayed in his car and waited for the police .
the s-1 section of the office of scientific research and development , as the advisory committee on uranium was now known , met on 18 december 1941 , with the u.s. now engaged in world war ii , making its work urgent . most of the effort sponsored by the committee had been directed at producing enriched uranium , but committee member arthur compton determined that a feasible alternative was plutonium , which could be mass-produced in nuclear reactors by the end of 1944 . he decided to concentrate the plutonium work at the university of chicago . fermi reluctantly moved , and his team became part of the new metallurgical laboratory there . don lincoln -lrb- born 1964 -rrb- is an american physicist , author , host of the youtube channel fermilab , and science communicator . he conducts research in particle physics at fermi national accelerator laboratory and is an adjunct professor of physics at the university of notre dame . he received a ph.d. in experimental particle physics from rice university in 1994 . in 1995 , he was a codiscoverer of the top quark . the laboratory was founded in 1967 as the national accelerator laboratory ; it was renamed in honor of enrico fermi in 1974 . the laboratory 's first director was robert rathbun wilson , under whom the laboratory opened ahead of time and under budget . many of the sculptures on the site are of his creation . he is the namesake of the site 's high-rise laboratory building , whose unique shape has become the symbol for fermilab and which is the center of activity on the campus .
uc berkeley removed the name boalt from the law school building in january 2020 . the de-naming was the outcome of a nearly three-year process launched after a berkeley lecturer discovered writings by john henry boalt which the university deemed racist . in an e-mail to the university at the time , uc berkeley chancellor carol christ wrote , `` boalt made profoundly offensive and racist statements about chinese and chinese americans , suggesting that it would be better to ` exterminate ' those of chinese descent than to have them assimilate . '' the university also found that boalt had no other historical legacy than his racism , and that naming the building after him had not been a condition of his widow 's donation . at the time of its founding , berkeley was the first full-curriculum public university in the state of california and thus was known as the university of california . as occurred in other states with only a single major public university , university of california was frequently shortened to california or cal , for ease of identification . because the school 's long sports tradition stretches back to an era before the founding of the other university of california branches , its athletic teams continue to be designated as california golden bears , cal bears , or simply , cal . andrew gabrielson , a trustee of the college of california at its beginning , suggested that the college be named in honor of the anglo-irish philosopher george berkeley . on march 4 , 1909 , following public referendums , the citizens of berkeley were granted a new charter by the state of california , and the town of berkeley became the city of berkeley . rapid growth continued up to the crash of 1929 . the great depression hit berkeley hard , but not as hard as many other places in the u.s. , thanks in part to the university .

on june 21 , 2011 , kelly announced his retirement from the u.s. navy and nasa , effective october 1 , 2011 . his retirement was announced on his facebook page , where he wrote , `` words can not convey my deep gratitude for the opportunities i have been given to serve our great nation . from the day i entered the united states merchant marine academy in the summer of 1982 to the moment i landed the space shuttle endeavour three weeks ago , it has been my privilege to advance the ideals that define the united states of america . '' former nasa astronaut mark kelly 's `` next mission '' is to be a us senator for arizona . `` i care about people . i care about the state of arizona . i care about this nation . when former nasa astronaut mark kelly announced his bid for the us senate on tuesday , he did what an increasing number of democratic candidates have done recently : he swore off donations from corporate pacs . `` this campaign is about the people of arizona , not corporate pacs and the mess they 've created in washington , '' kelly wrote on his campaign website . `` i wo n't take a dime of corporate pac money .

a study of international health care spending levels published in the health policy journal health affairs in the year 2000 found that the united states spends substantially more on health care than any other country in the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , and that the use of health care services in the u.s. is below the oecd median by most measures . the authors of the study conclude that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the u.s. than elsewhere . while the 19 next most wealthy countries by gdp all pay less than half what the u.s. does for health care , they have all gained about six years of life expectancy more than the u.s. since 1970 . in terms of population health , life expectancy in 2006 was about two and a half years longer in canada , with canadians living to an average of 79.9 years and americans 77.5 years . infant and child mortality rates are also higher in the u.s. . some comparisons suggest that the american system underperforms canada 's system as well as those of other industrialized nations with universal coverage . for example , a ranking by the world health organization of health care system performance among 191 member nations , published in 2000 , ranked canada 30th and the u.s. 37th , and the overall health of canada 35th to the american 72nd . a 2014 study by the private american foundation the commonwealth fund found that although the u.s. health care system is the most expensive in the world , it ranks last on most dimensions of performance when compared with australia , canada , france , germany , the netherlands , new zealand , norway , sweden , switzerland and the united kingdom . the study found that the united states failed to achieve better outcomes than other countries , and is last or near last in terms of access , efficiency and equity . study date came from international surveys of patients and primary care physicians , as well as information on health care outcomes from the commonwealth fund , the world health organization , and the organisation for economic co-operation and development .
a decision by president donald trump to use force in retaliation for an alleged chemical weapons attack in syria appears inevitable and imminent . but his goals in taking such action are less clear , as is the scale of the us response . trump effectively boxed himself into acting since he placed his and america 's credibility on the line by blasting a syrian government airfield with cruise missiles following a similar outrage against civilians last year . the president vowed monday to respond to a suspected chemical gas attack in syria , saying the us response would be forceful . top military officials , including defense secretary james mattis , warned president donald trump during an afternoon meeting thursday that he risks escalating us involvement in syria if he goes forward with the type of aggressive bombing campaign he has pressed for over the past week , according to us and western officials briefed on the conversation . trump has pushed military leaders to develop plans for a sustained assault on syrian regime targets in response to last weekend 's chemical attack , the officials said . but mattis and other members of the president 's national security team cautioned trump during the meeting that such a strategy could pull the us into direct conflict with russia and iran . the resistance has upset trump , who wanted to take quick action and feels like the options being presented to him do n't go far enough , according to the officials . the us-led military strikes in syria raise a number of questions : first , and most basic , what exactly is us policy in syria ? president donald trump said just two weeks ago in a speech in ohio that the us would `` be coming out of syria like very soon . '' now , trump has presided over a large-scale bombing operation aimed at three chemical weapons production and storage targets in syria , including in damascus , the syrian capital . so what is the trump administration policy ?
occupational safety and health -lrb- osh -rrb- , also commonly referred to as occupational health and safety -lrb- ohs -rrb- , occupational health , or occupational safety , is a multidisciplinary field concerned with the safety , health , and welfare of people at work . these terms also refer to the goals of this field , so their use in the sense of this article was originally an abbreviation of occupational safety and health program/department etc. . eu-osha , along with six national safety and health organisations , participates in a consortium that has produced a number of animated films which aim to convey the importance of health and safety in the workplace . the main character in these films -- known as napo -- is essentially a typical employee who can be the victim of situations over which he has no control but he can also identify hazards or risks , and make good suggestions to improve safety and work organisation . the films are all language-free , making them widely accessible , and have won a number of awards . napo has become somewhat of a mascot for eu-osha 's campaigning activities , and is now being used to introduce health and safety issues to children in primary schools -lrb- napo for teachers -rrb- . section 18 of the act permits and encourages states to adopt their own occupational safety and health plans , so long as the state standards and enforcement `` are or will be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment '' as the federal osh act . states that have such plans are known as `` osha states . '' as of 2007 , 22 states and territories operated complete plans and four others had plans that covered only the public sector .
in the office , detective reese continues to watch the video from rachel 's camera , here he notices glitches in the video . while burquez is speaking at the conference , the reporters begin receiving messages and burquez is told of a new development . reese realizes that the videos have been edited for the police to view , with the edits being released to the media . the video now shows rachel and leann carefully planning the massacre and framing tyler for everything . katrina , looking in the camera , begins talking about how the police will be scrambling over the scene to find out what is happening . she makes a dying request to be with the one she loves , gerry fleishman , her husband , and asks to be buried in the plot next to his . she goes over some of her husband 's mental and physical disabilities after he came back from war , about celebrities being famous for no reason , and she speaks of god ; the camera then stalls and flickers to a new image of the killer , we watch as katrina 's neck is sliced and she is killed while her camera records . emojis might just be the political cartoon for the snapchat generation . that 's the thinking behind a new ios emoji keyboard called hillarymoji . the keyboard hit the apple store on thursday with 20 hillary clinton-related stickers . it features emojis like clinton sporting a t-shirt that reads , `` the future is female , '' clinton channeling `` rosie the riveter , '' and a pink credit card that reads `` woman card '' in a nod to donald trump 's now infamous phrase .

the school of medicine was established by vote of the trustees of tufts college on 22 april 1893 . it was formed by the secession of seven faculty from the college of physicians and surgeons in boston , a school which was formed in 1880 . these `` original seven '' faculty members successfully lobbied to establish a medical school under the auspices of tufts college . the new school , which was designated the medical school of tufts college , opened its doors in october 1893 with eighty students . the school of engineering is one of the ten schools that comprise tufts university . the school offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in several engineering disciplines and computer science fields . along with the school of arts and sciences -lrb- a&s -rrb- and the fletcher school of law and diplomacy , the school of engineering is located on the university 's main campus in medford and somerville , massachusetts . currently , the engineering school enrolls more than 800 full-time undergraduates and 600 graduate students . in the 1840s , the universalist church wanted to open a college in new england , and charles tufts donated 20 acres to the church in 1852 to help them achieve this goal . charles tufts had inherited the land , a barren hill which was one of the highest points in the boston area , called walnut hill , and when asked by a family member what he intended to do with the land , he said `` i will put a light on it . '' his 20-acre donation -lrb- then valued at $ 20,000 -rrb- is still at the heart of tufts ' now-150 acre campus , straddling somerville and medford . it was also in 1852 that the commonwealth of massachusetts chartered tufts college , noting the college should promote `` virtue and piety and learning in such of the languages and liberal and useful arts as shall be recommended .

republican presidential candidate mitt romney had a win to savor and a wound to salve this week , after a crucial victory and a cringe-inducing gaffe . `` romney may have won new hampshire but the premise of his candidacy began to unravel , '' said an aide inside the re-election team backing president barack obama . the victory came in the new hampshire primary election , the second contest in the long series of state-by-state votes to choose the candidate against obama in november 's presidential election . romney also won in the state of iowa a week earlier , making him the first republican ever to take both opening rounds of voting . it 's round two in the race for the republican presidential nomination , with voting beginning in new hampshire . while most polling places in the state did n't open until early tuesday , the first votes were cast just after midnight in the tiny communities of dixville notch and hart 's location . in dixville notch , former massachusetts gov. mitt romney and jon huntsman , the former utah governor and ambassador to china , tied for the lead with two votes each . with a narrow loss , rick santorum scored a stunning victory and now heads to new hampshire , hoping this momentum sets him up as the anti-mitt romney in the race for the republican presidential nomination . santorum , who lost to romney by eight votes in the iowa caucuses early wednesday , is following a well-worn path on his march as the new political battleground shifts from this midwestern state to new hampshire . it is an uphill battle for santorum , who faces a better-funded rival in romney and questions about his own viability as a general election candidate . meanwhile , one-time leading contender newt gingrich is hoping to breathe new life into his campaign with a sharper message in a new state .
rick santorum wants you to compare him to hillary clinton -- by searching his name on the internet . nothing crazy about that , right ? right -- up to a point . here 's the thing : in making his request , santorum on thursday night uttered the single phrase so many believed would never , ever escape his lips . with momentum building for romney , santorum interrupted campaigning -lrb- as did romney -rrb- for the easter holiday to give his campaign staff a chance to be with their families . he used the opportunity to meet with `` movement conservatives '' to strategize . former family research council chief gary bauer , who was present at the sit-down with santorum , called it a strategy meeting . four days later , on april 10 , 2012 , rick santorum suspended his campaign without endorsing any other candidate . rand paul will boycott thursday night 's republican primary debate in south carolina after being relegated from the main stage , he said on monday . `` i wo n't participate in anything that 's not first tier because we have a first tier campaign , '' the kentucky senator told cnn 's wolf blitzer . paul 's announcement came moments before fox business network , the sponsor of thursday 's debate , announced that just seven candidates had qualified for the main stage . those candidates are donald trump , ben carson , ted cruz , marco rubio , chris christie , jeb bush and john kasich .
a few other minor schedule changes were also announced with the release of the schedule . unlike the 2017 season , the onemain financial 200 at dover international speedway will precede the alsco 300 at charlotte motor speedway , while the bar harbor 200 , also at dover international speedway , will move one week later to follow the drive for the cure 200 at charlotte motor speedway . the drive for the cure 200 will also utilize charlotte motor speedway 's 2.28-mile -lrb- 3.67 km -rrb- road course instead of its oval . road america will also move back to a saturday afternoon . this was the third year that the xfinity series -lrb- and the truck series -rrb- had a playoff system . for the first time in the three years of the playoffs at that time , elliott sadler and justin allgaier were not part of the `` championship 4 '' drivers competing for the title at homestead . both drivers did qualify for the postseason but did not advance to the last round of the playoffs as they had done the past two years . doug hoechst bought the club from allen and scales and , in 1984 , moved it to 382 east broad street and renamed it `` 40 watt club uptown '' . the 40 watt uptown was large and professional , and it was a major stop for underground independent music acts in the 1980s . in 1987 , when rents increased on the space , new owners jared bailey and barrie buck -lrb- then-wife of r.e.m. guitarist peter buck -rrb- , moved the club back to its west clayton street location .
before e3 , game publishers went to other trade shows like consumer electronics show and the european computer trade show to display new or upcoming products as to pre-sell shipments to retailers for the rest of the year including the late-year holiday season as well as to view for press coverage of upcoming games . as the game industry grew rapidly during the early 1990s , industry professionals felt that it had outgrown the older trade shows . according to tom kalinske , ceo of sega america , `` the ces organizers used to put the video game industry way , way in the back . in 1991 , they put us in a tent , and you had to walk past all the porn vendors to find us . though several companies agreed to present at this e3 event , ferrell discovered that cea had offered video game companies a dedicated space at the next ces , which would have conflicted with the planned e3 event , requiring the companies to pick one or the other . most of the idsa members supported e3 , while nintendo and microsoft were still supportive of the ces approach . after about three to four months , ferrell was told by cea 's ceo gary shapiro that he `` won '' and had cancelled the ces video game event , effectively making e3 the premier trade show for the video game industry . the first event was held from may 11 -- 13 , 1995 at the los angeles convention center , which would generally be the convention 's location in future years . the organizers were unsure of how successful this would be , but by the end of the convention , they had booked most of the space at the convention center , and saw more than 40,000 attendees . in the aftermath of its first year , e3 was already regarded as the biggest event in the video game industry . the idsa realized the strength of a debut trade show , and subsequently renegotiated with idg to allow the idsa to take full ownership of the show and the intellectual property associated with the name , while hiring idg to help with execution of the event .
in his lab , frank claims to have discovered the `` secret to life itself '' . his creation , rocky , is brought to life . the ensuing celebration is soon interrupted by eddie -lrb- an ex-delivery boy , both frank 's ex-lover and columbia 's current partner , as well as partial brain donor to rocky -rrb- who rides out of a deep freeze on a motorcycle . eddie then proceeds to seduce columbia , get the transylvanians dancing and singing and intrigue brad and janet . brad and janet are shown to separate bedrooms , where each is visited and seduced by frank , who poses as brad -lrb- when visiting janet -rrb- and then as janet -lrb- when visiting brad -rrb- . janet , upset and emotional , wanders off to look for brad , who she discovers , via a television monitor , is in bed with frank . she then discovers rocky , cowering in his birth tank , hiding from riff raff , who has been tormenting him . while tending to his wounds , janet becomes intimate with rocky , as magenta and columbia watch from their bedroom monitor . the rocky horror picture show helped shape conditions of cult film 's transition from art-house to grind-house style . the film developed a cult following in 1976 at the waverly theatre in new york , which developed into a standardised ritual . according to j. hoberman , author of midnight movies , it was after five months into the film 's midnight run when lines began to be shouted by the audience . louis farese jr. , a normally quiet teacher , upon seeing the character janet place a newspaper over her head to protect herself from rain , yelled , `` buy an umbrella , you cheap bitch . ''
fillion was the ` face ' of complete hero . the artist explained the choice of fillion as follows : `` i wanted to make a piece of work that looked at all kinds of heroism , not just the usual derring-do of white square-jawed men . but i thought it would be interesting to start with a white , square-jawed man and nathan fillion agreed to take part . '' reynolds was born in sydney , new south wales , australia , and attended matraville sports high school . andrew johns , matthew johns and darren lockyer were his favourite players when he was a kid and nathan merritt is his favourite south sydney player of all time . he then added when asked `` who is the most inspirational player or person on your career and how have they positively affected your football ? '' , he responded `` my brother -- he 's always on my back telling me to do extras and pushing me to be the best i can be . '' whedon approached nathan fillion to play the lead , and after explaining the premise and showing fillion the treatment for the pilot , fillion was eager for the role . fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast . he noted that `` it was really thrilling . it was my first lead and i was pretty nervous , but i really wanted that part and i wanted to tell those stories . ''
lei chen -lrb- chinese : 雷震 ; pinyin : léi zhèn ; 8 july 1897 -- 7 march 1979 -rrb- was an early leading figure in the movement to bring fuller democracy to the government of the republic of china . born in zhejiang in 1897 , lei was educated at kyoto imperial university in japan . his early political career included posts as the secretary-general of the political consultation conference and constituent national assembly . he also served on the control yuan , as minister without portfolio , and presidential adviser.lei chen helped found and produce the periodical free china , published beginning in 1950 . if the examples of wong yan lin and chen zhao pi are used , it took anywhere from 17 -- 18 days and at least 150-200 consecutive wins in order for a fighter , who set up his own lei tai , to establish his style 's dominance in that area . lei chen helped found and produce the periodical free china , published beginning in 1950 . lei was expelled from the kuomintang in 1954 . six years later , he founded the china democratic party with hsu shih-hsien and huang hua , among others . shortly thereafter , lei was charged with sedition and jailed .
a final source of cases is the referral power of the federal government . in such cases , the supreme court is required to give an opinion on questions referred to it by the governor-in-council -lrb- the cabinet -rrb- . however , in many cases , including the most recent same-sex marriage reference , the court has declined to answer a question from the cabinet . in that case , the court said it would not decide if same-sex marriages were required by the charter of rights , because the government had announced it would change the law regardless of its opinion , and subsequently did . the decision followed precedent in syndicat northcrest v. amselem -lrb- 2004 -rrb- that for a claim to freedom of religion to succeed , an individual should show they believe a practise is connected to a religious belief . next , the infringement of freedom of religion should be serious . in this case , the carrying of the kirpan was deemed to be connected to religion because it was necessary according to orthodox sikhism . the same beliefs also dictated that the kirpan not be used to harm others . the case involved a 13-year-old sikh named gurbaj singh , who in november 2001 dropped a metal kirpan at his school , école sainte‑catherine‑labouré . this prompted the school board to request certain limits on the wearing of the kirpan , including that it be covered at all times . the sikh family accepted this request . however , another board , in february 2002 , overrode the school board , deciding that the kirpan was a weapon and thus was not allowed under the code of conduct .
donald trump is currently winning more of the white evangelical vote than 2012 gop nominee mitt romney , according to a pew research center poll released wednesday . trump -- a presbyterian who has been married three times and has said he has never sought forgiveness from god -- is hardly a prototypical candidate for evangelicals , and romney , a mormon , also faced questions about the authenticity of his christian faith . but if the election were held today , 78 % of white evangelical registered voters say they would vote for trump , including about a third who `` strongly '' back his campaign . that number is higher than the 73 % of white evangelicals who supported romney at a similar point during the 2012 election . donald trump , the billionaire businessman whose outsider campaign has both galvanized millions of voters and divided the republican party , is the 2016 gop presidential nominee . the new yorker 's embrace by the republican national convention marks a remarkable moment in u.s. political history and validates a campaign that shattered precedent , defied pundits and usurped the gop establishment . his son donald trump , jr. , cast the votes for the new york delegation that put the billionaire businessman over the top of the 1,237 delegates he needed to clinch the nomination , as any talk of disruptive protest votes or walkouts dissipated . `` it is my honor to be able to throw donald trump over the top in the delegate count tonight with 89 delegates , '' donald jr. said , surrounded by three of trump 's other children -- ivanka , eric and tiffany . one of the craziest and most tumultuous presidential primary seasons in recent memory comes to a head monday as donald trump arrives in cleveland for the republican national convention . conventions are meant to be festive but tightly disciplined events , a rare moment when the republican party can control the program , reintroduce their candidate and launch him into the fall campaign with a bump in the polls . the political universe will be watching whether trump -- rarely known for his discipline -- can stick to his script . will he unite a party unraveled by his candidacy , or will he blow it apart ?
kansas -lrb- listen -rrb- is a u.s. state in the midwestern united states . its capital is topeka and its largest city is wichita , with its most populated county and largest employment center being johnson county . kansas is bordered by nebraska on the north ; missouri on the east ; oklahoma on the south ; and colorado on the west . kansas is named after the kansas river , which in turn was named after the kansa native americans who lived along its banks .
in order of the phoenix , ginny had `` given up on harry months ago '' -lrb- though this is merely a ruse as hermione previously advised her to pretend to not be as interested in harry and go out with a few other boys so harry would eventually notice her -rrb- , and has a boyfriend , michael corner , whom she met at the yule ball . when umbridge punishes harry with a `` lifetime '' quidditch ban , ginny replaces him as gryffindor seeker . during the last part of the book , ginny breaks up with michael due to his sulking over ravenclaw 's defeat in the quidditch cup final , later replacing him with dean thomas . she joins dumbledore 's army and is one of five members who accompany harry in his attempt to rescue sirius black from the department of mysteries . in a joint interview with the leaky cauldron and mugglenet , rowling revealed that she `` always knew '' that ginny and harry `` were going to come together and then part . '' the author explained that , as the series progresses , harry , and by extension the reader , discovers that ginny is in fact the ideal girl for harry . rowling stated that harry `` needs to be with someone who can stand the demands of being with harry potter , because he 's a scary boyfriend in a lot of ways . '' by the later part of the series , ginny and harry `` are total equals '' and `` worthy of each other . '' ginny is forceful , independent and often speaks her mind . she has an energetic , lively personality ; having feelings for harry , however , during the first few years of their friendship , she became shy and withdrawn in his presence . according to harry , growing up with six older brothers toughened her up . ginny is not afraid to stand up to anybody , friends and enemies alike .
the uneasy peace between the two leading democratic 2020 progressives broke down monday night , as sen. elizabeth warren publicly accused sen. bernie sanders of telling her during a private meeting in december 2018 that he did n't think a woman could win . the explosive accusation , which sanders had previously denied in response to a cnn report , opened a chasm between the two leading liberals in the race and significantly raised the stakes ahead of tuesday night 's cnn/des moines register democratic presidential debate , the final one before voters cast their first ballots of the presidential season next month . later on monday night , sanders senior adviser jeff weaver suggested in an interview with cnn 's chris cuomo that warren had misconstrued the conversation with sanders . the controversy raised fresh questions about the importance of identity politics in democratic politics amid ongoing accusations that the top of the party 's field is n't sufficiently diverse . democratic primary rivals elizabeth warren and bernie sanders agreed to disagree during tuesday 's primary debate on the contents of a private 2018 dinner conversation , punctuating a growing tension between the two leading 2020 progressives over whether sanders had told warren that a woman could not win during a discussion about the 2020 election . after sanders again denied having made the remark tuesday night , warren -- who has confirmed what four sources told cnn about the meeting -- stood by her account and again said that she `` disagreed '' with sanders ' assessment before pivoting to an argument underscoring the electoral prowess of the female candidates on the debate stage . `` but look , this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised and it 's time for us to attack it head-on , '' warren said . `` i think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people 's winning record . the stakes were high when bernie sanders and elizabeth warren met at warren 's apartment in washington , dc , one evening in december 2018 . the longtime friends knew that they could soon be running against each other for president . the two agreed that if they ultimately faced each other as presidential candidates , they should remain civil and avoid attacking one another , so as not to hurt the progressive movement . they also discussed how to best take on president donald trump , and warren laid out two main reasons she believed she would be a strong candidate : she could make a robust argument about the economy and earn broad support from female voters .
apple is betting its future on a $ 1,000 phone . on tuesday , apple unveiled new smartwatches , an apple tv and the iphone 8 and 8 plus at a press event . but the showstopper was a premium device called iphone x , with a starting price that would have once seemed laughable for a phone : $ 999 . tim cook , apple 's ceo , framed the device as being nothing short of `` the future of the smartphone . '' ten years after the launch of the first iphone , apple has revealed the iphone x . it has no home button , scans your face to log you in and costs $ 999 . the company unveiled the anniversary edition smartphone , alongside an iphone 8 and its bigger sibling , the iphone 8 plus , at a press event at the brand new apple park campus in cupertino on tuesday . the company also announced a new apple watch with a cellular connection , an apple tv that streams 4k video , and gave the public its first peek at the circular steve jobs theater . more than 10 years after steve jobs announced the original iphone in san francisco , apple is preparing for another landmark event . some things will be different . tim cook will be on stage , and the location will be apple 's brand new campus in cupertino . but the star of the show will still be the iphone .
principal photography in vancouver wrapped , as planned , on 15 april , but the production was soon beset by further tragedy when producer william vince died of cancer , just two days after model shooting back in london had wrapped . fellow producer amy gilliam , terry 's daughter , remembered , '' always said , ` if you get your film in the can , you 'll be all right . ' and i kind of believe that he stayed with us to know that happened . '' eventually , while on post-production , gilliam himself was hit by a car , resulting in a cracked vertebra . in october 2015 , in a webchat hosted by the guardian , gilliam announced that he was working on `` a tv series based on time bandits '' and `` another based on a script by richard lagravanese and i wrote after fisher king , called the defective detective . '' in july 2006 , after nearly six years of legalities between the french producers and german insurers , the issue over the rights was settled . terry gilliam announced this at the munich international documentary film festival , saying that the production company was willing to give gilliam the rights , and that jeremy thomas was still interested in producing . in august 2006 , gilliam indicated at a post-screening q&a for tideland that the complex legal case concerning the film 's collapse was finally being wrapped up , and that the rights to the script would hopefully be given back to gilliam and co-writer grisoni in the near future . he stated his intention to completely reshoot the film .
audrey accuses edith of not supporting her decision to go to middleton , and as revenge , edith lies and says that she and george are taking an exclusive tour of the campus with the university 's dean . audrey and conrad are then left alone with the rest of the `` cookie cutter '' tour , while edith and george play hooky . the two borrow some bikes to explore the campus . they climb to the top of the belltower , and sneak into an acting class . as benedict heads to examine the ruined vault himself , his men stop the van and find the bags were only loaded with flyers for prostitutes . benedict studies the video footage and recognizes that the flooring in the vault on the video lacks the bellagio logo , which had been added only recently to the vault . it is shown that danny 's team used their practice vault to create fake footage to fool benedict . furthermore , they themselves were the swat team and used their gear bags to take all of the money from the vault right under benedict 's nose . north america is a continent entirely within the northern hemisphere and almost all within the western hemisphere . it is also considered by some to be a northern subcontinent of the americas . it is bordered to the north by the arctic ocean , to the east by the atlantic ocean , to the west and south by the pacific ocean , and to the southeast by south america and the caribbean sea . north america covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers -lrb- 9,540,000 square miles -rrb- , about 16.5 % of the earth 's land area and about 4.8 % of its total surface .
on may 4 , 2008 , it was announced that ge would auction off its appliances business for an expected sale of $ 5 -- 8 billion . however , this plan fell through as a result of the recession . in mid december 2008 , ge money announced it was in advanced talks with the national australia bank -lrb- nab -rrb- to sell the wizard brand . ultimately , wizard was bought by the commonwealth bank of australia . on the 24th of october 2008 , ge money announced that it will cease offering motor finance in australia and new zealand . this move has proven damaging to ge aligned dealerships who have been given 60 days to find an alternate financier to provide floorplan finance . ge money also announced that it will be pulling out of the mortgage industry and no longer providing mortgages other than those sold under the wizard brand .
liddell settled in liverpool with phyllis and their twin sons , residing in merseyside until his death . when his father died in january 1951 , liddell arranged for his mother , sister , and younger brothers to relocate to the city , concentrating his family in the region . while still a player , liddell was appointed a justice of the peace for liverpool in 1958 and contributed a column to the echo 's football edition . he became occupied with voluntary work , which entailed him being an occasional disc jockey for the women 's voluntary service at alder hey children 's hospital , working for local youth clubs , and teaching at a sunday school . producer david puttnam viewed footage from a 1924 film of liddell and abrahams while researching the film with scriptwriter colin welland and liddell 's unorthodox running style as portrayed in the film , with his head back and his mouth wide open , is also said to be accurate . at an athletics championship in glasgow , a visitor watching the 440-yard final , in which liddell was a long way behind the leaders at the start of the last lap -lrb- of a 220-yard track -rrb- , remarked to a glasgow native that liddell would be hard put to win the race . the glaswegian merely replied , `` his head 's no ' back yet . '' liddell then threw his head back and , with mouth wide open , caught and passed his opponents to win the race . liddell 's first job as a missionary was as a teacher at an anglo-chinese college -lrb- grades 1 -- 12 -rrb- for wealthy chinese students . while he is best known for athletics , his true passion was found in his missionary work . it was believed that by teaching the children of the wealthy , they would become influential figures in china and promote christian values . liddell used his athletic experience to train boys in a number of different sports .
attorney general eric holder said monday night that a federal civil rights investigation into the shooting of michael brown will continue despite a st. louis county grand jury 's decision to not indict ferguson police officer darren wilson . holder noted that federal civil rights cases have a `` high legal bar , '' but said federal investigators have `` resisted forming premature conclusions . '' `` though we have shared information with local prosecutors during the course of our investigation , the federal inquiry has been independent of the local one from the start , and remains so now , '' holder said in a statement . `` even at this mature stage of the investigation , we have avoided prejudging any of the evidence . '' earlier in the hearing , the prosecution presented a 1979 missouri statute allowing officers to use deadly force `` to effect the arrest or prevent the escape from custody '' . before the grand jury deliberated , jurors were told to disregard the previous instructions and use case law from the tennessee v garner ruling , which said it was unconstitutional for police officers to use deadly force to apprehend non-dangerous fleeing suspects . missouri attorney general chris koster , acknowledged the grand jury was given information based on the state law before being informed that deadly force can not be used merely to prevent the escape of an unarmed suspect . msnbc 's lawrence o'donnell argued that this change amounted to a deliberate attempt by the prosecution to make it impossible to indict wilson . ahead of a grand jury 's decision on whether to indict a police officer in the killing of michael brown , missouri has both called in the national guard and diminished the role of the ferguson police department . missouri gov. jay nixon declared a state of emergency monday as a precaution , he said , in the event of unrest or violence . it 's unknown when the grand jury will hand down a decision on whether to indict ferguson police officer darren wilson for his fatal shooting of brown , a teen .
the ira claim responsibility for the execution of lord louis mountbatten . this operation is one of the discriminate ways we can bring to the attention of the english people the continuing occupation of our country . ... the death of mountbatten and the tributes paid to him will be seen in sharp contrast to the apathy of the british government and the english people to the deaths of over three hundred british soldiers , and the deaths of irish men , women , and children at the hands of their forces . the first official history of mi5 , the defence of the realm -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , implied that there was a plot against wilson and that mi5 did have a file on him . yet it also made clear that the plot was in no way official and that any activity centred on a small group of discontented officers . this much had already been confirmed by former cabinet secretary lord hunt , who concluded in a secret inquiry conducted in 1996 that `` there is absolutely no doubt at all that a few , a very few , malcontents in mi5 ... a lot of them like peter wright who were right-wing , malicious and had serious personal grudges -- gave vent to these and spread damaging malicious stories about that labour government . '' the united states of america -lrb- usa -rrb- , commonly known as the united states -lrb- u.s. or us -rrb- or america , is a country comprising 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . at 3.8 million square miles -lrb- 9.8 million km2 -rrb- , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of europe . most of the country is located in central north america between canada and mexico . with an estimated population of over 328 million , the u.s. is the third most populous country .
at first , the waldorf appeared destined for failure . it was originally a laughing stock with its high number of bathrooms and was known briefly as `` boldt 's folly '' or `` astor 's folly '' , with the general perception of the palatial hotel being that it had no place in new york city . wealthy new yorkers were angry because they viewed the construction of the hotel as the ruination of a good neighborhood . business travelers found it too expensive and too far uptown for their needs . in modern times , the clientele of the waldorf is more typically wealthy politicians and businessmen than playboys and royalty . an entire floor was often rented out to wealthy saudi arabians with their own staff . wealthy japanese businessmen during their stay would sometimes remove the furniture and replace it with their own floor mats . one early wealthy resident was chicago businessman j. w. gates who would gamble on stocks on wall street and play poker at the hotel . in 1955 , marilyn monroe and her husband , arthur miller stayed at the hotel for several months , but due to costs of trying to finance her production company `` marilyn monroe productions '' , only being paid $ 1,500 a week for her role in the seven year itch and being suspended from 20th century fox for walking out on fox after creative differences , living at the hotel became too costly and monroe had to move into a different hotel in new york city . around the same time that monroe lived in the hotel , cole porter and linda lee thomas had an apartment in the waldorf towers , where thomas died in 1954 . porter 's 1934 song `` you 're the top '' , contains the lyric , `` you 're the top , you 're a waldorf salad '' . the cole porter suite , suite 33a , was the place where porter lived and entertained for a period .
martin shkreli once bragged that he would go to a `` club fed '' instead of a real jail . now he is inmate # 87850-053 at a brooklyn federal jail , which is about as real as it gets . `` it 's a tough place , '' said robert kipnees , a white-collar criminal defense attorney at the new york firm lowenstein sandler . brooklyn metropolitan detention center is a federal jail with a population of nearly 2,000 . the metropolitan detention center , guaynabo -lrb- mdc guaynabo -rrb- is a united states federal prison facility in guaynabo , puerto rico which holds male and female inmates of all security levels who are awaiting trial or sentencing . it is operated by the federal bureau of prisons , a division of the united states department of justice . federal prosecutors want a judge to revoke bail for martin shkreli after he offered money to anyone who could grab hillary clinton 's hair . in a court filing on thursday , the prosecutors called it part of `` an escalating pattern of threats and harassment . '' shkreli , a former pharmaceutical executive who gained national notoriety two years ago for jacking up the price of a drug used by aids patients , was convicted of securities fraud last month for mismanaging two investment funds . the prosecutors cited a facebook post on monday in which shkreli promoted a conspiracy theory about the clinton foundation and offered the money for a lock of clinton 's hair .
the day after anne 's execution in 1536 the 45-year-old henry became engaged to seymour , who had been one of the queen 's ladies-in-waiting . they were married ten days later . on 12 october 1537 , jane gave birth to a son , prince edward , the future edward vi . the birth was difficult , and the queen died on 24 october 1537 from an infection and was buried in windsor . as washington 's estate , mount vernon , lay on the way from scotchtown to philadelphia , he invited henry to stop there and to ride to philadelphia with him , and henry did , also accompanied by pendleton , another virginia delegate to the congress and a political rival of henry 's . delegates and prominent philadelphians took an intense interest in the virginians , who had taken the lead in resistance to britain , but whom few in the other colonies had met . this was henry 's first stay in the north , excepting a brief business trip to new york in 1770 but he found that his actions were well known . the sessions began on september 5 , 1774 , at carpenter 's hall . in 1502 , arthur died at the age of 15 , possibly of sweating sickness , just 20 weeks after his marriage to catherine . arthur 's death thrust all his duties upon his younger brother , the 10-year-old henry . after a little debate , henry became the new duke of cornwall in october 1502 , and the new prince of wales and earl of chester in february 1503 . henry vii gave the boy few tasks .
chichita , who , by the way , was french , stayed with tito 's son . on the other hand , emilio and his lawyer , jean paul , were jailed after being found guilty of fraud , but , since they were rich , they enjoyed privileges that most inmates can not , such as their own private lavatories , private television sets and catering , clean , designer clothes , and other things . even after emilio found that laiza used to be a man , he realized laiza was his real love , and the two ended up together . michael coren began his review of the death of a pope with the claim : `` if there were any justice in the world of letters , piers paul read would be spoken of with amis , barnes , rushdie and the rest of the dominant literary class wherever the great contemporary british novelists were mentioned . '' in the death of a pope , coren noted , `` read is impressive but in some ways jarring in that he 's prepared to give some of the best lines to the bad guys . '' but it is typical of a novelist of read 's quality `` that the characters in black hats are deliciously ambivalent -- though the author has a taut and trusted morality , he 's too sophisticated to make his characters mere conduits for right and wrong . there is complexity here , confusion , a sing-song of lyrical paradox and good intentions leading to colossally evil acts . following their signing to interscope , brand new stopped touring to work on their third album and major label debut . in this time , little to no interviews or updates came from the band . in 2004 , jesse lacey told chart magazine that he had written a `` few songs '' for the next album , commenting that `` the other guys love it already '' . he made mention of the pressure he felt with the `` loads of anticipation building up on my shoulders , '' saying that he suffered from depression because of this ; `` i 'm getting depressed with all of the anxiety about the album and they say i write my best stuff when i 'm in that state .
years later , norman carlson , director of the bureau of prisons at the time of the marion incident , said that ordering the permanent lockdown was the only way to deal with `` a very small subset of the inmate population who show absolutely no concern for human life . '' he pointed out that the two inmates who killed the guards were already serving multiple life sentences , so adding another would have had no effect . the `` control unit '' model at marion was later the basis for adx florence , which opened in 1994 as a specifically designed supermax prison . marion correctional institution is a state prison for men in ocala , marion county , florida , owned and operated by the florida department of corrections . the facility houses a maximum of 1324 inmates at a mix of security levels . it stands near to florida 's florida women 's reception center and lowell correctional institution , both women 's facilities . lowell correctional institution is a women 's prison in unincorporated marion county , florida , north of ocala , in the unincorporated area of lowell . a part of the florida department of corrections , it serves as the primary prison for women in the state . almost 3,000 women are incarcerated in the complex , which includes the lowell annex . as of 2015 2,696 women are in the main lowell ci , making it the largest prison for women in the united states ; its prison population became larger than that of the central california women 's facility that year .
the university was founded as coeducational . president peck stated at the opening ceremonies , `` the conditions of admission shall be equal to all persons ... there shall be no invidious discrimination here against woman ... . brains and heart shall have a fair chance ...

in 1866 , benjamin henry , angered over what he believed was inadequate compensation , attempted to have the connecticut legislature award ownership of new haven arms to him . oliver winchester , hastening back from europe , forestalled the move and reorganized new haven arms yet again as the winchester repeating arms company . winchester had the basic design of the henry rifle completely modified and improved to become the first winchester rifle , the model 1866 , which fired the same .44 caliber rimfire cartridges as the henry but had an improved magazine -lrb- with the addition of a loading gate on the right side of the receiver , invented by winchester employee nelson king -rrb- and , for the first time , a wooden forend . the henry and the 1866 winchester shared a unique double firing pin which struck the head of the rimfire cartridge in two places when the weapon was fired , increasing the chances that the fulminate in the hollow rim would ignite the 28 or so grains of black powder inside the case . u.s. repeating arms company to close new haven , ct facility -- u.s. repeating arms company , maker of winchester brand rifles and shotguns will close its new haven , connecticut manufacturing facility . many efforts were made to improve profitability at the manufacturing facility in new haven , and the decision was made after exhausting all available options . the volcanic rifle had only limited success , which was partially attributable to the design and poor performance of the hunt-derived volcanic cartridge : a hollow conical ball filled with black powder and sealed by a cork primer . although the volcanic 's repeater design far outpaced the rival technology , the unsatisfactory power and reliability of the .25 and .32 caliber `` rocket balls '' were little match for the competitors ' larger calibers . wesson had left volcanic soon after it was formed and smith followed eight months later , to create the smith & wesson revolver company . volcanic moved to new haven in 1856 , but by the end of that year became insolvent .

after superclash iii , ken mantell and fritz von erich sold wccw to cwa owner jerry jarrett . according to skandor akbar , jarrett got sued by kevin , although his brother kerry welcomed jarrett to the promotion . the combined federation became known as the uswa . jarrett would run the new uswa out of two headquarters : one in dallas -lrb- the weekly shows in fort worth being discontinued at this point , however several fort worth cards were still held -rrb- , the other in memphis . after the failure of superclash iii , in 1989 , kevin became very despondent over his father 's decision to sell the promotion to jerry jarrett , who owned the memphis-based cwa , despite his brother kerry welcoming jarrett into the mix ; the merged promotions became the uswa . however , because of disputes , including suing jarrett himself , he pulled wccw out of the uswa in 1990 , but he could n't resurrect the promotion his father built and had no choice but shut down world class that november . kevin did manage to draw crowds to the sportatorium in the early going , but with the absence of his brother , manager/booker gary hart , and the lack of televised matches , world class ' survival was very thin . in 1991 , as deputy chief of staff to mayor richard daley , jarrett interviewed michelle robinson for an opening in the mayor 's office , after which she immediately offered robinson the job . robinson asked for time to think and also asked jarrett to meet her fiancé , barack obama . the three ended up meeting for dinner . after the dinner , robinson accepted the job with the mayor 's office .
she could , maybe , be the first beauty pageant contestant to sport a tattoo , but determining that would necessitate reportage on the obscured derrieres and other regions of hundreds of past contestants . so we 'll just say miss kansas , theresa vail , is the first beauty queen to prominently sport a large tattoo during a pageant . but that 's not the only thing that sets her apart from most bombshells . the miss america contestant also hunts deer with a bow and is an m16 marskman -lrb- markswoman ? -rrb- after nearly a week of high-heeled dancing , vaseline-covered teeth , and skillfully concealed hostility , the glitter has finally settled over atlantic city -- and 24-year-old nina davuluri of syracuse , new york has been named the latest in a long line of all-american beauty queens . davuluri is n't just the second consecutive pageant winner from the empire state -- she 's also the first woman of indian descent to snag the crown . obviously , congratulations are in order -- but nina 's not the only one who deserves a little recognition . check out my list of alternate-category winners , and feel free to add your own ... as long as you deliver them with a blindingly white smile . nina davuluri , a 24-year-old indian-american from upstate new york , expertly twirled to the pulsing beats of a bollywood tune during the talent portion of the miss america pageant . at the same time , she spun the traditional notion of american beauty on its head . in the interview portion of sunday 's pageant , davuluri was asked about chinese-american journalist julie chen 's decision to have eyelid surgery to advance her career . `` i do n't agree with plastic surgery ; however , i can understand that from a standpoint , '' davuluri said , delivering a noncommittal , diplomatic answer .
swanson became a vegetarian around 1928 and was an early health food advocate who was known for bringing her own meals to public functions in a paper bag . swanson told actor dirk benedict about macrobiotic diets when he was battling prostate cancer at a very early age . he had refused conventional therapies and credited this kind of diet and healthy eating with his recovery . in 1975 , swanson traveled the united states and helped to promote the book sugar blues written by her husband , william dufty . swanson was angered by the response , as she felt those very studios had produced questionable films themselves , and were jealous at not having the chance to produce rain . after another threatening telegram , she decided to first appeal to the mpaa , and then the newspapers . she heard back only from marcus loew , who promised to appeal on her behalf , and since he owned a chain of theaters this eased some of her concerns . figuring the silence meant the matter had been dropped , swanson began filming on sadie thompson which already had $ 250,000 invested in it . william swanson -lrb- 1819 -- 23 april 1903 -rrb- was a 19th-century member of parliament in auckland , new zealand . he represented the newton electorate from 1871 to 1884 , when he retired . he was a minister in the vogel ministry , 1876 and grey ministry 1877 -- 1879 as a member of the executive council . he was then appointed to the legislative council in 1885 , a position he held until his death.in the 1870s he won a bet with john sangster macfarlane who had claimed that a certain politician would soon be in mt eden -lrb- gaol -rrb- , and used to display the cheque for £ 80 which he received from macfarlane but did not cash .
at the moment of impact , secretary of defense donald rumsfeld was in his office on the other side of the pentagon , away from the crash site . he ran to the site and assisted the injured . rumsfeld returned to his office , and went to a conference room in the executive support center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with vice president dick cheney and other officials . on the day of the attacks , dod officials considered moving their command operations to site r , a backup facility in pennsylvania . throughout his time as defense secretary , rumsfeld was noted for his candor and quick wit when giving weekly press conferences or speaking with the press . u.s. news & world report called him `` a straight-talking midwesterner '' who `` routinely has the press corps doubled over in fits of laughter '' . by the same token , his leadership was exposed to much criticism through provocative books covering the iraq conflict , like bob woodward 's state of denial , thomas e. ricks ' fiasco , and seymour hersh 's chain of command . as a result , rumsfeld stirred controversy as to whether the forces that did invade iraq were enough in size . in a september 2007 interview with the daily telegraph , general mike jackson , the head of the british army during the invasion , criticized rumsfeld 's plans for the invasion of iraq as `` intellectually bankrupt , '' adding that rumsfeld is `` one of those most responsible for the current situation in iraq , '' and that he felt that `` the us approach to combating global terrorism is ` inadequate ' and too focused on military might rather than nation building and diplomacy .

by the end of gilman 's presidency , johns hopkins university , johns hopkins press , johns hopkins hospital and johns hopkins school of nursing , and johns hopkins school of medicine , and johns hopkins colored children orphan asylum had been founded ; the latter by the trustees , and the others in the order listed under the gilman administration . `` sex '' and `` color '' were major issues in the early history of the johns hopkins institutions . the founding of the school of nursing is usually linked to johns hopkins ' statements in his march 1873 instruction letter to the trustees that `` i desire you to establish , in connection with the hospital , a training school for female nurses . this provision will secure the services of women competent to care for those sick in the hospital wards , and will enable you to benefit the whole community by supplying it with a class of trained and experienced nurses '' . john rudolph niernsee , one of the most famous architects of the time , designed the orphan asylum and helped to design the johns hopkins hospital . the original site for the johns hopkins university had been chosen personally by hopkins . according to his will , it was to be located at his summer estate , clifton . however , a decision was made not to found the university there . johns hopkins ' quaker faith and his early life experiences , in particular the 1807 emancipation , had a lasting influence throughout his life and his posthumous legacy as a businessman , railroad man , banker , investor , ship owner , philanthropist and a founder of several institutions . from very early on , johns hopkins had looked upon his wealth as a trust to benefit future generations . he is said to have told his gardener that , `` like the man in the parable , i have had many talents given to me and i feel they are in trust . i shall not bury them but give them to the lads who long for a wider education '' ; his philosophy quietly anticipated andrew carnegie 's much-publicized gospel of wealth by more than 25 years .
there was much controversy from lagerfeld 's use of a verse from the qur ` an in his spring 1994 couture collection for chanel , despite apologies from the designer and the fashion house . the controversy erupted after the 1994 couture show in paris , when the indonesian muslim scholars council in jakarta called for a boycott of chanel and threatened to file formal protests with the government of lagerfeld 's homeland , germany . the designer apologized , explaining that he had taken the design from a book about the taj mahal , thinking the words came from a love poem . lagerfeld was a supporter of the use of fur in fashion , although he himself did not wear fur and hardly ate meat . in a bbc interview in 2009 , he claimed that hunters `` make a living having learnt nothing else than hunting , killing those beasts who would kill us if they could '' and maintained : `` in a meat-eating world , wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags , the discussion of fur is childish . '' spokespersons for people for the ethical treatment of animals -lrb- peta -rrb- called lagerfeld `` a fashion dinosaur who is as out of step as his furs are out of style '' , and `` particularly delusional with his kill-or-be-killed mentality . when was the last time a person 's life was threatened by a mink or rabbit ? '' paris fashion week was the final week of fashion month , in which she walked in seven shows for nina ricci , sonia rykiel , cacharel , stella mccartney , paul & joe , kenzo and chanel . this was the beginning of what would turn out to be a longlasting professional relationship with chanel 's head designer and creative director , karl lagerfeld . in an interview with elle after the show , lagerfeld said , `` cara is different . she 's full of life , full of pep .

since the school was established as a department of the main branch of the university of texas at austin , the school 's colors were originally orange and white . however , in the early 1980s , columbia blue was added so now the official colors are orange , white , and blue . when the new utep athletic department logo was introduced in the fall of 1999 , a darker hue of blue was incorporated into the logo , as well as a silver accent to go with the customary orange . when the 60th texas state legislature designated the university of texas as the university of texas system in 1967 , the name of the school was changed to the university of texas at el paso . while the 1967 law designated `` u.t. el paso '' as the school 's official abbreviated name , the school is more commonly referred to by its trademarked name of `` utep '' . known as the miners since the school 's opening in 1914 , tcm 's students painted a large `` m '' for miners on the franklin mountains in 1923 ; this was later moved to a site adjacent to the sun bowl stadium in the 1960s where it remains today . the university of texas at austin -lrb- ut austin -rrb- is a public research university in austin , texas . it was founded in 1883 and is the flagship institution of the university of texas system . the university of texas was inducted into the association of american universities in 1929 , becoming only the third university in the american south to be elected . the institution has the nation 's eighth-largest single-campus enrollment , with over 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and over 24,000 faculty and staff .

polling remained close throughout september and october , but reagan 's performance in the october 28 debate and carter 's failure to win the release of the iranian hostages gave reagan the momentum entering election day . reagan won 50.7 percent of the popular vote and 489 electoral votes , carter won 41 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes , and anderson won 6.6 percent of the popular vote . reagan carried all but a handful of states , and performed especially well among southern whites . the size of reagan 's victory surprised many observers , who had expected a close race . president carter was challenged by ted kennedy for his re-election bid in the democratic presidential primary . carter would later write that the ongoing iran hostage crisis impacted the latter 's choice to rely on rosalynn among others in his administration to advocate for his policies on the campaign trail . vice president mondale would come to view himself and rosalynn as president carter 's proxies through much of the spring portion of the election cycle . rosalynn would reflect that the iowa victory of the carter re-election campaign , which saw president carter defeat kennedy 59.16 % to 31.23 % , made attacks by kennedy easier for her to not be bothered by . the final fifteen months of carter 's presidential tenure were marked by several major crises , including the iran hostage crisis , serious fuel shortages , and the soviet invasion of afghanistan . ted kennedy , a prominent liberal democrat who protested carter 's opposition to a national health insurance system , challenged carter in the 1980 democratic primaries . boosted by public support for his policies in late 1979 and early 1980 , carter rallied to defeat kennedy and win re-nomination . in the general election , carter faced reagan , a conservative former governor of california .

apple lost the trademark battle to solid group in a 2015 decision made by ipo director nathaniel arevalo , who also reportedly said that it was unlikely that consumers would be confused between the `` iphone '' and the `` myphone '' . `` this is a case of a giant trying to claim more territory than what it is entitled to , to the great prejudice of a local ` pinoy phone ' merchant who has managed to obtain a significant foothold in the mobile phone market through the marketing and sale of innovative products under a very distinctive trademark '' , arevalo later added . after three mass shootings left at least 32 people dead in the span of a week , fbi director chris wray has ordered the agency 's offices across the country to conduct a new threat assessment in an effort to thwart future mass attacks , law enforcement sources told cnn . field offices will be actively working to identify threats similar to the attacks last week at local food festival in california , a walmart in texas , and an entertainment district in ohio , the sources said . a command group at the bureau 's washington headquarters will oversee the effort , the sources said . the agency said it was concerned that us-based domestic violent extremists could become inspired by the attacks to `` engage in similar acts of violence .

it was created on february 14 , 1903 , during the administration of president theodore roosevelt . investigations were the province of its bureau of corporations . the department was renamed the department of commerce on march 4 , 1913 , and its bureaus and agencies specializing in labor were transferred to the new department of labor . in 1915 , the bureau of corporations was spun off as an independent agency , the federal trade commission . the united states department of labor -lrb- dol -rrb- is a cabinet-level department of the u.s. federal government responsible for occupational safety , wage and hour standards , unemployment insurance benefits , reemployment services , and some economic statistics ; many u.s. states also have such departments . the department is headed by the u.s. secretary of labor . the purpose of the department of labor is to foster , promote , and develop the wellbeing of the wage earners , job seekers , and retirees of the united states ; improve working conditions ; advance opportunities for profitable employment ; and assure work-related benefits and rights . in carrying out this mission , the department of labor administers and enforces more than 180 federal laws and thousands of federal regulations . the department was originally created as the united states department of commerce and labor on february 14 , 1903 . it was subsequently renamed the department of commerce on march 4 , 1913 , as the bureaus and agencies specializing in labor were transferred to the new department of labor .
it 's not just mexico that is n't paying for the wall -- congress is n't either , apparently . but president donald trump is n't ready to break it to his supporters just yet . rather than selling a potential breakthrough , reached on capitol hill to stave off a new partial government shutdown , trump revived the molten rhetoric on immigration that helped make him president at a boisterous campaign rally in el paso , texas , on monday night . the drama provided an eloquent snapshot of the political forces over immigration tearing at the cohesion of the republican party . a photojournalist for the bbc was attacked monday while covering president donald trump 's rally in el paso , texas . a rallygoer gained access to an area designated for the news media and began shoving people , according to video of the incident . no one was seriously hurt . but it is the latest example of anti-media hostility boiling over at trump 's campaign events . as a cameraman with 25 years ' experience working at the bbc , ron skeans probably knows a thing or two about hostile environments . his colleagues have been killed and injured working in war zones and dictatorships the world over . but when skeans landed the plum job in the corporation 's washington dc bureau in 1994 , he surely did n't expect to come under physical threat while covering the rarified arena of us politics . of course , that was before the arrival of donald trump as commander in chief .
in 2005/2006 , a consultant group from portland , oregon , prepared a `` santa fe downtown vision plan '' to examine the long-range needs for the `` downtown '' area , roughly bounded by the paseo de peralta on the north , south and east sides and by guadalupe street on the west . in consultation with members of community groups , who were encouraged to provide feedback , the consultants made a wide range of recommendations in the plan now published for public and city review . in a september 2003 report by angelou economics , it was determined that santa fe should focus its economic development efforts in the following seven industries : arts and culture , design , hospitality , conservation technologies , software development , publishing and new media , and outdoor gear and apparel . three secondary targeted industries for santa fe to focus development in are health care , retiree services , and food & beverage . angelou economics recognized three economic signs that santa fe 's economy was at risk of long-term deterioration . these signs were ; a lack of business diversity which tied the city too closely to fluctuations in tourism and the government sector ; the beginnings of urban sprawl , as a result of santa fe county growing faster than the city , meaning people will move farther outside the city to find land and lower costs for housing ; and an aging population coupled with a rapidly shrinking population of individuals under 45 years old , making santa fe less attractive to business recruits . rather than turn its survey southward at dodge city , at&sf headed southwest over raton pass because of coal deposits near trinidad , colorado and raton , new mexico . the denver & rio grande railroad -lrb- d&rg -rrb- was also aiming at raton pass , but at&sf crews arose early one morning in 1878 and were hard at work with picks and shovels when the d&rg crews showed up for breakfast . at the same time the two railroads had a series of skirmishes over occupancy of the royal gorge west of cañon city , colorado ; physical confrontations led to two years of armed conflict that became known as the royal gorge railroad war . federal intervention prompted an out-of-court settlement on february 2 , 1880 , in the form of the so-called `` treaty of boston '' , wherein the d&rg was allowed to complete its line and lease it for use by the santa fe .
the episode `` that 's so suite life of hannah montana '' is the second part of a three-way crossover that begins on that 's so raven and concludes on hannah montana . raven baxter meets zack and cody as she visits the tipton hotel to do a photo shoot promoting a new fashion line for boys , only to have a troubling psychic vision of cody . in the meantime , london refuses to wear one of raven 's original designs until hannah montana stops by and shows an interest in the fashions . the show was enormously successful in europe , making cody an international celebrity and an american icon . mark twain commented , `` it is often said on the other side of the water that none of the exhibitions which we send to england are purely and distinctly american . if you will take the wild west show over there you can remove that reproach . '' the wild west brought an exotic foreign world to life for its european audiences , allowing a last glimpse at the fading american frontier . in his shows , the indians were usually depicted attacking stagecoaches and wagon trains and were driven off by cowboys and soldiers . many family members traveled with the men , and cody encouraged the wives and children of his native american performers to set up camp -- as they would in their homelands -- as part of the show . he wanted the paying public to see the human side of the `` fierce warriors '' and see that they had families like any others and had their own distinct cultures .
supporters of the chicago teachers union rallied saturday on the sixth day of a strike that has shut down the city 's schools , even as a deal with the school board was in the works . both sides expressed optimism that students could be back in school by monday , but the massive gathering was a reminder that until a deal is signed , the strike is not over . `` we do n't have an agreement , we have a framework for an agreement , '' union president karen lewis reiterated at the rally saturday at union park . joining the thousands of teachers at the rally were parents and students who declared their solidarity with them . the chicago teachers union and the city 's school board reached a tentative agreement friday in their dispute over new contract terms that has closed public schools for 350,000 students . despite the possible deal , union president karen lewis cautioned that the strike , in its fifth day friday , is not yet over . union officials will meet between now and sunday to draft specific language on a `` framework for an agreement . '' they will present the document to a special committee of union representatives , at which time a majority vote will be taken on whether to suspend the strike . new hope has emerged for ending the chicago teachers strike that has closed public schools for 350,000 students . chicago teachers union spokeswoman stephanie gadlin said union delegates with the power to stop the walkout would meet on friday at 2 p.m. ct. . there will be no classes friday , the fifth day of the strike , gadlin said thursday . the union and the school board met late into the night on wednesday with the parties emerging more optimistic than in previous negotiating sessions .
by the mid-1980s , the company again had a strong balance sheet and began buying other businesses including the six flags amusement park chain in 1983 , and the health and tennis corporation of america . the health club division , under `` bally total fitness '' , grew during the 1980s and 1990s . the company also purchased several casinos , including the mgm grand hotel and casino on the las vegas strip -lrb- which was subsequently re-branded as bally 's las vegas -rrb- , the mgm grand reno -lrb- reno , nv -rrb- and the golden nugget atlantic city which was branded bally 's grand and then later `` the grand-a bally 's casino resort '' . this expansion quickly took its toll on the company 's finances , and bally was soon forced to sell off several divisions , including six flags and bally-midway . the company opened the park place casino & hotel on december 29 , 1979 . also in the late 1970s , bally made an entry into the growing market for home computer games . the bally professional arcade , as the machine was called , had advanced features for the time . these included a palette of 256 colors and the ability to play 4-voice music . bally 's atlantic city is a hotel and casino on the boardwalk in atlantic city , new jersey that is owned by vici properties and operated by caesars entertainment . the marlborough-blenheim hotel stood on the site before the casino was built . it is famous for its address of `` park place and the boardwalk '' , two locations popularized by the board game monopoly . bally 's is one of the largest hotels on the boardwalk with nearly 1,169 rooms .
slack ran a full-page advertisement in the new york times acknowledging the competing service . though slack is used by 28 companies in the fortune 100 , the verge wrote executives will question paying for the service if teams provides a similar function in their company 's existing office 365 subscription at no added cost . zdnet reported that the companies were not competing for the same audience , as teams , at the time , did not let members outside the subscription join the platform , and small businesses and freelancers would have been unlikely to switch . microsoft has since added this functionality . the kinect , a motion-sensing input device made by microsoft and designed as a video game controller , first introduced in november 2010 , was upgraded for the 2013 release of the xbox one video game console . kinect 's capabilities were revealed in may 2013 : an ultra-wide 1080p camera , function in the dark due to an infrared sensor , higher-end processing power and new software , the ability to distinguish between fine movements -lrb- such as a thumb movements -rrb- , and determining a user 's heart rate by looking at their face . microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers as part of a plan to make the viewing experience more interactive . on july 19 , 2013 , microsoft stocks suffered its biggest one-day percentage sell-off since the year 2000 , after its fourth-quarter report raised concerns among the investors on the poor showings of both windows 8 and the surface tablet . the hotmail brand was planned to be phased-out when microsoft announced that the new mail system would be called windows live mail , but the developers soon backtracked after beta-testers were confused with the name change and preferred the already well-known hotmail name , and decided on windows live hotmail . after a period of beta testing , it was officially released to new and existing users in the netherlands on november 9 , 2006 , as a pilot market . development of the beta was finished in april 2007 , windows live hotmail was released to new registrations on may 7 , 2007 , as the 260 million msn hotmail accounts worldwide gained access to the new system . the old msn hotmail interface was accessible only by users who registered before the windows live hotmail release date and had not chosen to update to the new service .
the code name `` trinity '' was assigned by j. robert oppenheimer , the director of the los alamos laboratory , inspired by the poetry of john donne . the test was of an implosion-design plutonium device , informally nicknamed `` the gadget '' , of the same design as the fat man bomb later detonated over nagasaki , japan , on august 9 , 1945 . the complexity of the design required a major effort from the los alamos laboratory , and concerns about whether it would work led to a decision to conduct the first nuclear test . the test was planned and directed by kenneth bainbridge . julius robert oppenheimer -lrb- ; april 22 , 1904 -- february 18 , 1967 -rrb- was an american theoretical physicist and professor of physics at the university of california , berkeley . oppenheimer was the wartime head of the los alamos laboratory and is among those who are credited with being the `` father of the atomic bomb '' for their role in the manhattan project , the world war ii undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons . the first atomic bomb was successfully detonated on july 16 , 1945 , in the trinity test in new mexico . oppenheimer later remarked that it brought to mind words from the bhagavad gita : `` now i am become death , the destroyer of worlds . '' the manhattan project was top secret and did not become public knowledge until after the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki , and oppenheimer became a national spokesman for science who was emblematic of a new type of technocratic power . he became a household name and his portrait appeared on the covers of life and time . nuclear physics became a powerful force as all governments of the world began to realize the strategic and political power that came with nuclear weapons . like many scientists of his generation , he felt that security from atomic bombs would come only from a transnational organization such as the newly formed united nations , which could institute a program to stifle a nuclear arms race .

the world 's largest rice producer is hungry for more and looking to the u.s. for supplies . china will import american rice for the first time after a new trade deal was agreed to thursday . `` the agreement with china has been in the works for more than a decade and i 'm pleased to see it finally come to fruition , especially knowing how greatly it will benefit our growers and industry , '' said u.s. agriculture secretary sonny perdue in a statement . china produces 20 times more rice than the u.s. , but it 's also the world 's biggest consumer . hobart college of the 19th century was the first american institution of higher learning to establish a three-year `` english course '' of study to educate young men destined for such practical occupations as `` journalism , agriculture , merchandise , mechanism , and manufacturing '' , while at the same time maintaining a traditional four-year `` classical course '' for those intending to enter `` the learned professions . '' it also was the first college in america to have a dean of the college . a former airbnb host who canceled a guest 's reservation citing her race , will have to do more than pay a $ 5,000 fine . the host , who has been banned by airbnb after the february incident , agreed to take a college-level asian american studies course , volunteer at a civil rights organization and participate in a community education panel . the california department of fair employment and housing announced the somewhat unusual agreement thursday and described the measures as `` forward-looking and restorative '' in a statement . dyne suh had driven in a snowstorm to the airbnb rental near big bear , california .
the announcement about selling the chinese-built vehicle to american consumers has drawn a backlash from the united auto workers , who had just finalized a contract agreement with gm and had wanted the automaker to build the envision stateside : `` today 's announcement by general motors that they are importing the envision from china is a slap in the face to u.s. taxpayers and the men and women who worked so hard to save gm during its darkest time , '' uaw president dennis williams and vice president cindy estrada , who head the gm department for the union , said in a joint statement on december 4 , 2015 . on the other hand , buick spokesman stuart fowle defended the decision to keep production in china and import it rather than having it built in the united states because it made sense from a business point of view : `` we have production already going -lrb- in china -rrb- and adding a second manufacturing facility for the volumes that we would expect in the u.s. just was n't feasible , '' he said . `` we wanted to take advantage of the manufacturing already in place . we 're very confident in the vehicle . '' on september 7 , 2014 , at the intelligent transport systems world congress in detroit gm disclosed it would be introducing auto-pilot features into certain 2017 models of its cars , which would go on sale in 2016 . the `` super cruise '' or vehicle-to-vehicle v2v technology is likely to be first introduced to the cadillac range , enabling drivers to switch in and out of semi-automated mode . in december 2016 , general motors announced it would begin testing self-driving vehicles on public roads in michigan , after gov. rick snyder signed a package of bills legalizing the operation of autonomous vehicles . on august 6 , 2018 , general motors announced that it might withdraw the envision from the united states market , should a request to seek a waiver to continue to import the vehicle is denied . gm is seeking the waiver amid a trade war between the united states and china over tariffs that could hurt the sales of the envision . the automaker sees the potential exemption as `` the only way '' to continue offering the vehicle to u.s. consumers , according to gm president dan ammann . the exemption was denied on may 29 , 2019 , but gm has opted to pay the tariffs without raising the price on the vehicle for the time being .
in an emergency attempt to salvage the chapter , a team of national representatives came to the university in november 2006 to conduct a membership review , interviewing women individually about their dedication to the sorority . -lrb- delta zeta representatives have repeatedly asserted that they undertook the review on the advice of the university , whereas depauw officials `` vehemently '' deny this . -rrb- a few days after the interview process , the national team with women from δζ 's epsilon chapter at nearby indiana university held a recruiting event in the house , where some allege 25 of the chapter members were asked not to participate and to remain out of sight . a february 25 , 2007 article in the new york times quoted one former delta chapter member as saying , `` they had these unassuming freshman girls downstairs with these plastic women from indiana university , and 25 of my sisters hiding upstairs . on march 29 , 2007 , it was reported in the new york times that delta zeta 's national office , based in oxford , ohio , had filed suit in u.s. federal district court in indianapolis against depauw university for expelling the sorority from campus . the university said the lawsuit completely lacks merit . `` from the beginning , depauw university has acted to protect its students . '' in november , 2007 , delta zeta withdrew the lawsuit and depauw agreed that the sorority will have the opportunity to compete with other sororities attempting to colonize a chapter on the campus beginning in academic year 2010/11 however delta zeta elected not to compete for the 2010/2011 academic year and as of may 2010 has no future plans to do so . since the reorganization and before the national publicity , 8 of 11 freshman women who received invitations to join delta zeta during formal recruitment chose not to become members . one said , `` we all got together and talked about it and tried to have an open mind . but all of us were really against what they did , and we did n't want to be associated with it .

in 1861 and 1862 , the war was going badly for the union army and there were , by some counts , 180,000 desertions . in 1863 and 1864 , the bitterest two years of the war , the union army suffered over 200 desertions every day , for a total of 150,000 desertions during those two years . this puts the total number of desertions from the union army during the four years of the war at nearly 350,000 . using these numbers , 15 % of union soldiers deserted during the war . following the washington accord on 4 july , where sharif agreed to withdraw pakistani troops , most of the fighting came to a gradual halt , but some pakistani forces remained in positions on the indian side of the loc . in addition , the united jihad council -lrb- an umbrella for all extremist groups -rrb- rejected pakistan 's plan for a climb-down , instead deciding to fight on . the indian army launched its final attacks in the last week of july ; as soon as the dras sub-sector had been cleared of pakistani forces , the fighting ceased on 26 july . the day has since been marked as kargil vijay diwas -lrb- kargil victory day -rrb- in india . just prior to the revolution , a second stream of immigrants came directly from ireland via charleston . this group was forced to move into an underdeveloped area because they could not afford expensive land . most of this group remained loyal to the crown or neutral when the war began . prior to charles cornwallis 's march into the backcountry in 1780 , two-thirds of the men among the waxhaw settlement had declined to serve in the army .
colombian kingpin jose evaristo linares-castillo was arrested in 2013 . he is considered to be one of the most notable narcotics traffickers in the world . he is accused of producing cocaine in colombia , storing it in apure , and then transporting it to central america and mexico before smuggling it into the united states . henry de jesus lopez -lrb- nicknamed `` mi sangre '' , meaning `` my blood '' -rrb- , reported at the time to be the country 's most-wanted cocaine dealer , was arrested in 2012 in argentina . roberto escobar maintains pablo fell into the drug business simply because other types of contraband became too dangerous to traffic . as there were no drug cartels then , and only a few drug barons , pablo saw it as untapped territory he wished to make his own . in peru , pablo would buy the cocaine paste , which would then be refined in a laboratory in a two-story house in medellín . on his first trip , pablo bought a paltry 30 pounds -lrb- 14 kg -rrb- of paste in what was noted as the first step towards building his empire . the initial episodes start at the year of 1973 in chile , with mateo `` cockroach '' moreno , a chilean drug dealer and underground chemist in a secret cocaine lab in the atacama desert , is discovered by the chilean armed forces and his cartel members are completely executed , but mateo surprisingly survives , in which later he manages to escape to colombia . it is followed with the show how escobar first became involved in the cocaine trade in colombia . he was an established black marketeer in medellín , moving trucks worth of illegal goods -lrb- alcohol , cigarettes , and household appliances -rrb- into colombia during a time when this was strictly forbidden , when introduced to mateo , who pitched the idea that they go into business together , with moreno producing and escobar distributing a new , profitable drug -- cocaine . they expand beyond moreno 's small cocaine processing lab by building additional , larger labs in the rainforest and , using the expertise of carlos lehder , transport their product in bulk to miami , where it gains notoriety amongst the rich and famous .

if you think you 're too tired for sex , you 're not alone . according to a large new study , women over age 50 who get fewer than seven hours of sleep are less likely to report being sexually active than their peers who sleep more , a problem that increases with age . sleep disorders can also interfere with sex . research suggests that men with obstructive sleep apnea , a condition marked by snoring and breathing difficulties , have decreased levels of sexual activity , possibly because they produce lower amounts of testosterone . they may look cute , and you may think of them as your pets , but experts ask that you keep your chickens in your backyard . do n't snuggle with them . do n't sit them next to you as you watch tv . and please , do n't commit a fashion foul and dress them in tiny costumes , no matter how adorable .

while developing the eye of minds , dashner wanted to avoid creating a world that was too similar to his earlier work , the maze runner series . dashner enjoyed employing the virtual reality setting , as it allowed him an `` endless '' amount of worlds and settings for the novel . he drew inspiration for the book from multiple book and film sources , particularly the matrix and inception . dashner has stated that he plans for the series ' story arc to only span three books , as he felt that it `` really out well for what i want to happen overall '' but that he does view the series as being more open to sequels than his earlier work maze runner . in 2018 , dashner was dropped by his agent , michael bourret , and by his publisher , penguin random house , following accusations of sexual harassment ; dashner replied in a statement , `` i am taking any and all criticisms and accusations very seriously , and i will seek counseling and guidance to address them . '' in february 2018 , comments were posted anonymously on the school library journal website , alleging that dashner had engaged in sexual harassment . four comments claimed harassment by dashner , and two more said that they had reported him in a medium survey about harassment . a commenter later claimed to have been one of the accusers , and said that they `` made it up '' . one of those commenters claimed to have been subject to `` months of manipulation , grooming and gaslighting '' .
the first session of saddam 's trial lasted three hours . the court adjourned the case until 28 november 2005 , as some of the witnesses were too frightened to attend , and to allow the defense more time to study evidence . during an interview with the arab news agency al-arabiya following the opening of the trial , saddam 's eldest daughter raghad branded the court a `` farce '' and claimed that her father behaved like a `` lion '' during the proceedings . `` he would be a lion even when caged . the execution of former iraqi president saddam hussein took place on saturday , 30 december 2006 . saddam was sentenced to death by hanging , after being convicted of crimes against humanity by the iraqi special tribunal for the murder of 148 iraqi shi'ites in the town of dujail in 1982 , in retaliation for an assassination attempt against him . on 5 november 2006 , saddam hussein was sentenced to death by hanging for the killing of 148 shiites from dujail , in retaliation for the assassination attempt of 8 july 1982 . when the judge announced the verdict , saddam shouted , `` long live the people . long live the arab nation . down with the spies .
after he became an actor , his agent henry willson thought the name `` ohanian '' was too similar to the actor george o'hanlon and gave him the stage name `` touch connors '' . `` touch '' was his basketball nickname , and willson considered `` connors '' to be a `` good all-american name '' . connors later stated he hated the name `` from day one '' and considered not using his real name the only big regret of his career . after getting the starring role in tightrope ! , connors wanted to be credited as ohanian but columbia pictures told him that he had already done too much work as connors , though he was allowed to change his first name to mike . according to an advertisement placed in the christian science monitor , charles todd of philadelphia recalled the day in 1932 when his childhood friend , esther jones , and her husband charles darrow came to their house for dinner . after the meal , the todds introduced darrow to the landlord 's game , which they then played several times . the game was entirely new to darrow , and he asked the todds for a written set of the rules . after that night , darrow went on to utilize this and distribute the game himself as monopoly . the values of the dice are not random . as stated in the contest rules , one property in each set is `` rare , '' similar to the sticker game . these rare properties are landed on only when the game server `` seeds '' a winning roll . winning rolls are seeded at specific times on specific dates , and the first user to roll the dice once a win has been seeded will land on a winning piece .
by the turn of the 20th century , amateur advisors and publications were increasingly challenging the monopoly that the large retail companies had on interior design . english feminist author mary haweis wrote a series of widely read essays in the 1880s in which she derided the eagerness with which aspiring middle-class people furnished their houses according to the rigid models offered to them by the retailers . she advocated the individual adoption of a particular style , tailor made to the individual needs and preferences of the customer : fictional interior decorators include the sugarbaker sisters on designing women and grace adler on will & grace . there is also another show called home made . there are two teams and two houses and whoever has the designed and made the worst room , according to the judges , is eliminated . another show on the style network , hosted by niecy nash , is clean house where they re-do messy homes into themed rooms that the clients would like . interior architecture is the design of a building or shelter from inside out , or the design of a new interior for a type of home that can be fixed . it can refer to the initial design and plan used for a building 's interior , to that interior 's later redesign made to accommodate a changed purpose , or to the significant revision of an original design for the adaptive reuse of the shell of the building concerned . the latter is often part of sustainable architecture practices , whereby resources are conserved by `` recycling '' a structure through adaptive redesign .
the university logo , the upheld torch , is derived from the statue of liberty , signifying nyu 's service to new york city . the torch is depicted on both the nyu seal and the more abstract nyu logo , designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer tom geismar of the branding and design firm chermayeff & geismar . there are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color , violet . some believe that it may have been chosen because violets are said to have grown abundantly in washington square and around the buttresses of the old university building . three community colleges had been established by early 1961 , when new york city 's public colleges were codified by the state as a single university with a chancellor at the helm and an infusion of state funds . but the city 's slowness in creating the community colleges as demand for college seats was intensifying and had resulted in mounting frustration , particularly on the part of minorities , that college opportunities were not available to them . new york university school of medicine has recently implemented the curriculum for the 21st century . the new curriculum consists of 18 months of basic science and two and a half years of clinical training . students take the usmle step 1 exam after the clerkship year -lrb- with the exception of md/phd students , who take it before starting their phd work -rrb- . this allows students additional time to take electives , conduct research , or go on away rotations .
on september 27 , 2004 , the 50th anniversary of the show 's premiere , nbc announced that jay leno would be succeeded by conan o'brien in 2009 . the network shocked leno , who had been consistently number one in the time period , when he was told that he would be fired in five years , with o'brien taking over the slot at that time . leno told his audience about this unique network decision at the beginning of his next show , mentioning that he 'd accepted it , noting that he wanted to avoid repeating the hard feelings that had somehow developed with letterman , and called o'brien `` certainly the most deserving person for the job '' in the wake of his -lrb- leno 's -rrb- eventual departure . five years later , what was to have been the final episode of the tonight show with leno as host aired on friday , may 29 , 2009 . leno has faced heated criticism and some negative publicity for his perceived role in the 2010 tonight show conflict . critics have pointed to a 2004 tonight show clip , in which leno said he would allow o'brien to take over without incident . at the time , leno stated he did not want o'brien to leave for a competing network , adding , `` i 'll be 59 when , that 's five years from now . there 's really only one person who could have done this into his 60s , and that was johnny carson ; i think it 's fair to say i 'm no johnny carson . '' on december 8 , 2008 , it was reported that leno would remain on nbc and move to a new hour-long show at 10 p.m. eastern time -lrb- 9 p.m. central time -rrb- five nights a week . this show followed a similar format to the tonight show , was filmed in the same studio facility and retained many of leno 's most popular segments . late night host conan o'brien was his successor on the tonight show .
after president trump announced his withdrawal of the united states from the paris agreement on june 1 , obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice : `` but even in the absence of american leadership ; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future ; i 'm confident that our states , cities , and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way , and help protect for future generations the one planet we 've got . '' american-based firms that use legal loopholes to avoid paying u.s. taxes have effectively renounced any allegiance to their home country , president barack obama will claim during remarks at a community college here on thursday . taking up a harsh new attack against companies that establish residency in tax havens like the caymen islands and bermuda while keeping the bulk of their operations in the united states , obama will call on congress to mend a loophole allowing billions in tax revenue to slip through the government 's fingers . a white house official , previewing obama 's remarks , said the president would make the case on thursday that tax-avoiding companies `` are essentially renouncing their american citizenship so that they can ship their profits overseas to avoid paying taxes -- even as they benefit from all the advantages of being here in america . '' the white house has aimed this week to advance the president 's domestic agenda , focusing on jobs programs and the economy . the obama administration , after initially resisting the idea , is weighing whether to deploy national guard troops to the southern border to help address a surge of migrant youth from central america , many of them unaccompanied , a white house official told cnn . the pentagon and the department of health and human services sent a team earlier this week to assess border patrol efforts in the rio grande valley , the official said , where tens of thousands of children have poured into the united states this year . the administration 's latest efforts in what most agree is a humanitarian crisis come as washington struggles to address the matter with little optimism for a solution before congress breaks for its month-long august recess . immigrants or refugees ?
during the tenure of smith , the school also gained university status from the south carolina general assembly , becoming south carolina state university in february 1992 . in 1993 , barbara hatton became the school 's first female president and created many improvements for the campus , such as the 1994 renovation of oliver c. dawson bulldog stadium , constructing new suites and a larger press box , as well as increasing its capacity to 22,000 . hatton also spearheaded the creation of a plaza which resides in front of the student union and passes by several dorms and buildings in the central portion of the campus . under sc state 's next president , leroy davis , south carolina state university celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1996 , and the school constructed a fine arts center in 1999 , giving the art and music departments a new home . the school 's name changed , as well , as the south carolina general assembly renamed the school south carolina state college in 1954 . because of the `` separate but equal '' laws in the state , the legislature gave the college large sums of money to build new academic facilities and dormitories , some of which still stand on the campus today , including the student union -lrb- 1954 -rrb- , and turner hall -lrb- 1956 -rrb- . this was done in order to give black students an environment of `` equal '' education . also , the legislature created a law program for the college , mainly to prevent black students from attending the law school at the then-segregated university of south carolina . loy norrix opened in 1960 after kalamazoo central high school graduated 800 students the year prior , the largest graduating class to that date . the school is named after former superintendent loy norrix . the school has been dubbed the `` glass castle '' , due to its almost completely glass frame , prominently featured in an advertisement for lof glass in the september 21 , 1962 issue of life magazine . loy norrix is also home to the freshman academy , where freshmen are all housed in one wing of the school -lrb- the b wing -rrb- .
`` when you 're attacking fbi agents because you 're under criminal investigation , you 're losing , '' sarah sanders , then a donald trump campaign aide , famously said of hillary clinton supporters before the 2016 presidential election . although she has repeatedly struggled with the facts -- and now serves as white house press secretary -- sanders ' apt tweet remains wisdom for the ages . both president donald trump and sanders have led the charge against special counsel robert mueller and his team of prosecutors investigating the trump campaign 's possible ties to russia and other crimes unearthed in that endeavor . trump has repeatedly called the investigation a `` witch hunt '' in an attempt to paint mueller and his team as a band of corrupt authorities trying to bring down an innocent president . in an august 2019 interview with the washington post , donald trump opened up about his relationship with his late brother and expressed regret over how he treated fred jr. and his struggle with alcoholism . trump said freddy 's memory still shapes his life to this day , and had a huge impact on the trajectory of his own business career and life . in the interview donald trump said , `` he was so handsome , and i saw what alcohol did to him even physically ... and that had an impact on me , too . '' michael cohen -- a `` very weak person '' in the words of president donald trump -- made a plea deal with special counsel robert mueller on thursday that should not be ignored . it 's another significant moment in a probe that appears to be picking up speed and tightening the vise around some senior members of the trump administration . consider what cohen pleaded guilty to doing : lying to congress about the nature and extent of his dealing with russians over a proposed trump tower development in moscow . cohen told congress all conversations with the russians ceased in january 2016 , right around the time when trump first faced voters in the iowa caucuses .
watson 's career emerged through his work for conspiracy theorist and radio host alex jones . as editor-at-large of jones ' website infowars he helped promote fake news and advocated conspiracy theories such as the claim 9/11 was a government cover-up , the chemtrail conspiracy theory , and the new world order . subsequently reaching a significant audience , both watson and jones altered their focus . presently their commentary is mainly focused on criticizing feminism , islam , and left-wing politics . youtube , facebook and apple have taken steps to remove content associated with infowars and its founder alex jones . cnn opinion asked a group of contributors to weigh in on the implications for both free and commercial speech and what it means in the political moment . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors . view more opinion articles on cnn . big tech made a show on sunday night and monday of moving against conspiracy theorist alex jones and his media company infowars . but apple and google are both still selling its app , which contains some of the same type of content that both tech giants have pulled from elsewhere on their platforms . it 's unclear how long the app has been available in the two app stores , but infowars has been publicizing the app 's availability since at least july 13 . both stores categorize infowars as `` news .

pope francis , speaking on the final day of a historic summit on clergy sexual abuse , called priests and other catholics who abuse children `` tools of satan , '' but offered no concrete steps to address the church 's massive and morally damning abuse crisis . `` the brutality of this worldwide phenomenon becomes all the more grave and scandalous in the church , for it is utterly incompatible with -lrb- its -rrb- moral authority and ethical credibility , '' the pope said in a speech in vatican city on sunday . `` consecrated persons , '' he continued , `` chosen by god to guide souls to salvation , let themselves be dominated by their human frailty or sickness and thus become tools of satan . '' the pope 's speech , delivered at the end of mass at sala regia in the apostolic palace , came at the end of an unprecedented gathering of 190 catholic leaders , including 114 bishops from around the world , to address a clergy sexual abuse scandal that stretches across several continents . for the first time in catholic history , nearly 200 church leaders from around the world will gather at the vatican starting thursday to confront the scourge of clergy who sexually abuse children . the unprecedented , four-day summit , convened by pope francis last september , will include two speeches by the pope , talks outlining best practices , small group discussions among bishops and a penitential ceremony involving abuse survivors . `` we must look this monster in the face without fear if we really want to conquer it , '' said alessandro gisotti , a vatican spokesman . but as nearly every day brings new revelations about secrets and scandals at the heart of the catholic church , it seems as if the monster confronting the church only grows larger . pope francis began an unprecedented summit in rome to confront the catholic church 's clergy abuse scandal by saying that catholics are not looking for simple condemnation , but concrete actions . `` in the face of this scourge of sexual abuse perpetrated by men of the church to the detriment of minors , i thought i would summon you , '' the pope told the nearly 200 catholic leaders gathered in vatican city , `` so that all together we may lend an ear and listen to the holy spirit ... and to the cry of the small ones who are asking for justice . '' `` the holy people of god are looking at us and expect from us not simple condemnations , '' francis continued in his opening address , `` but concrete and effective measures to put in place . we need to be concrete .

the golem is a 2018 israeli period supernatural horror film directed by doron and yoav paz , and written by ariel cohen . it stars hani furstenberg , ishai golan , brynie furstenberg , and konstantin anikienko . the golem is based on the jewish legend of the same name , and the film 's creators felt that the legend , which they referred to as `` the jewish frankenstein '' , had never been properly developed into a film since the silent 1920 version the golem : how he came into the world . originally it was intended to retain the original appearance of the title character for the film , `` in the beginning , when we just started on the idea for the movie , we tried to tell the story as it is . columbus is the state capital and the most populous city in the u.s. state of ohio . with a population of 892,533 as of 2018 estimates , it is the 14th-most populous city in the united states and one of the fastest growing large cities in the nation . this makes columbus the second-most populous city in the midwest -lrb- after chicago , illinois -rrb- . it is the core city of the columbus , oh metropolitan statistical area , which encompasses ten counties . golem is a 1996 picture book written and illustrated by david wisniewski . with illustrations made of cut-paper collages , it is wisniewski 's retelling of the jewish folktale of the golem with a one-page background at the end.the story is set in year 1580 in prague , and the jews are being persecuted . judah loew ben bezalel , the town rabbi , can think of nothing more than creating a being out of mud and bringing it to life , using the holy name of god , to protect them . once the golem stops the persecution , rabbi loew erases the letters on the golem 's head , making the golem `` sleep the dreamless sleep of clay '' .
out of africa is divided into five sections , most of which are non-linear and seem to reflect no particular chronology . the first two focus primarily on africans who lived or had business on the farm , and include close observations of native ideas about justice and punishment in the wake of a gruesome accidental shooting . the third section , called `` visitors to the farm , '' describes some of the more colourful local characters who considered blixen 's farm to be a safe haven . the fourth , `` from an immigrant 's notebook , '' is a collection of short sub-chapters in which blixen reflects on the life of a white african colonist . out of africa has been noted for its melancholy and elegiac style -- blixen biographer judith thurman employs an african tribal phrase to describe it : `` clear darkness . '' it is not an insignificant fact that blixen 's tales encompass the deaths of at least five of the important people in the book . as the chapters proceed , blixen begins to meditate more plainly on her feelings of loss and nostalgia for her days in africa . as she describes the economic realities of her failed business closing in on her , she comments wryly on her mixture of despair and denial , until the last days are upon her and she gives in to the inevitable . the song is about forgiveness , and according to brandon heath , was inspired by seeing an old photograph of someone he had n't been in touch with for a while .

mrc approached different networks about the series , including hbo , showtime and amc , but netflix , hoping to launch its own original programming , outbid the other networks . ted sarandos , netflix 's chief content officer , looked at the data of netflix users ' streaming habits and concluded that there was an audience for fincher and spacey . `` it looked incredibly promising , '' he said , `` kind of the perfect storm of material and talent . '' in finding a writer to adapt the series , fincher stated that they needed someone who could faithfully translate parliamentary politics to washington . '' barack obama might appear on-camera as the moderator of a new series on netflix . or he might stay off-camera as a producer of a show about uplifting american stories . or maybe he 'll do both . talks are underway between obama and netflix , according to a source familiar with the discussions . in march 2011 , representative michele bachmann told conservative radio host jeff katz on his program , `` i 'll tell you one thing , if i was ever to run for president of the united states , i think the first thing i would do in the first debate is offer my birth certificate , so we can get that off the table .

when it comes to iran and the west , the relationship has been convoluted for decades . and this deal is no different . after days of negotiations , six world powers and tehran reached an agreement that calls on iran to limit its nuclear activities in return for lighter sanctions . it 's complicated politics coupled with complicated science . the diplomatic gridlock between iran and the west seemed immovable for decades . but on sunday , diplomats made history when iran and six world powers came together on an agreement over iran 's nuclear program . the deal dials back iran 's ability to work toward a nuclear weapon and at the same time loosens the choke hold of international sanctions on iran 's economy . the two sides now have six months to find out how historic the breakthrough really is . it is the first major international agreement on iran 's nuclear ambitions after a decade of failed efforts , and follows the first notable thaw in u.s-iranian relations in 34 years . iran reaches nuclear deal with world leaders -- now what ? then why are so many people at home and around the world so angry , or at least concerned , about the six-month deal reached over the weekend by negotiators in geneva ? the reasons are as numerous and complex as the diverse assortment of critics , including israel and arab powers who remain technically at war , as well as congressional republicans and some leading democrats .

leaders of some countries reserved enthusiasm for the obama inauguration , with coverage of the event even muted in some places . cuban president raúl castro , brother of former cuban president fidel castro , declared that '' looks like a good man , i hope he is lucky '' , while ricardo alarcón , president of the cuban legislature , admitted in his comments about obama that `` the incoming president ` is a big question mark . ' '' iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki expressed hope for openness for a new direction , noting that `` if obama chooses the right path , compensates the past , lifts hostility and u.s. hegemony , and revises the previous political mistakes , we will have no hostility . '' state-owned channel one russia , russia 's flagship early evening news show , covered obama 's presidential inauguration as a minor news story , devoting much of the day 's airtime instead to the gas war with ukraine . barack obama has publicly responded to questions regarding his religion on more than one occasion . during a debate of democratic presidential candidates on january 15 , 2008 , in las vegas , nevada , the moderator , brian williams , asked obama about the rumor that he was `` trying to hide the fact that he is a muslim '' . obama responded that `` the facts are : i am a christian . i have been sworn in with a bible . '' tracey mann , a candidate running for congress from kansas in 2010 , stated at a candidate forum that obama `` should show his birth certificate to really resolve this thing one way or another '' . in a radio interview , he answered a question as `` i think the president of the united states needs to come forth with his papers and show everyone that he 's an american citizen and put this issue to bed once and for all . '' in response , on july 21 , 2010 , the hutchinson news , a local paper in hutchinson , kansas , withdrew their endorsement of mann , saying that mann `` questions the citizenship of president barack obama despite evidence that is irrefutable to most objective , rational people -- including a birth certificate released by the hawaii secretary of state and birth announcements printed in honolulu 's two major newspapers '' . mann responded that he was `` disappointed and mystified by the hutchinson news ' decision to withdraw their endorsement over a misunderstanding of position '' , as he is not `` interested in pursuing this issue in congress '' , and he has `` never had any interest in spending any time on the matter '' .
according to some christian sects in japan , jesus christ did not die on the cross at golgotha . instead his younger brother , isukiri , took his place on the cross , while jesus fled across siberia to mutsu province , in northern japan . once in japan , he became a rice farmer , married , and raised a family with three daughters near what is now shingō . while in japan , it is asserted that he traveled , learned , and eventually died at the age of 106 . the consensus of scholarship is that the new testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a friday , but a thursday or wednesday crucifixion have also been proposed . some scholars explain a thursday crucifixion based on a `` double sabbath '' caused by an extra passover sabbath falling on thursday dusk to friday afternoon , ahead of the normal weekly sabbath . some have argued that jesus was crucified on wednesday , not friday , on the grounds of the mention of `` three days and three nights '' in matthew before his resurrection , celebrated on sunday . others have countered by saying that this ignores the jewish idiom by which a `` day and night '' may refer to any part of a 24-hour period , that the expression in matthew is idiomatic , not a statement that jesus was 72 hours in the tomb , and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights . i wanted to do the film on two or three levels -- sound and picture would take us back , and we 'd go from one flashback to another , and then that flashback would go inside another flashback ... i wanted multiple layers because reading the warren commission report is like drowning .
president barack obama tried thursday to invigorate the stalled middle east peace process , urging young israelis to pressure their leaders to seek peace with palestinians while acknowledging the jewish state 's historical right to exist and defend itself from continuing threats . in a speech in jerusalem that obama had said would lay out his vision for the region , the president urged israelis to look at the world through the eyes of palestinians but also said enemies of israel must change their rhetoric and tactics to reflect modern reality . `` you are not alone , '' obama said in both english and hebrew , prompting a standing ovation when he declared that `` those who adhere to the ideology of rejecting israel 's right to exist might as well reject the earth beneath them and the sky above , because israel is not going anywhere . '' hours before the speech on the second day of a middle east swing , two rockets fired from palestinian-controlled gaza landed in southern israel . the banners hanging on israeli street corners boast of the `` unbreakable alliance '' with the united states , and the stars and stripes is flying side by side with the star of david all across jerusalem . it is a proud moment for the host nation . but as president barack obama heads to israel and the west bank for the first time since moving into the white house , there is no expectation of any significant policy breakthroughs and countless questions about his frosty relationship with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . `` it is the most dysfunctional relationship in the history of u.s.-israeli relations , '' former u.s. mideast negotiator aaron david miller told cnn . in his first visit to israel and the west bank since assuming the white house , president barack obama ventures into a region of the world whose politics are layered and complex . as he meets with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , obama will address problems on many levels , including his chilly relationship with netanyahu , iran 's growing nuclear threat , syria 's possible use of chemical arms and the elusive prospect of peace between israel and the palestinians . the to-do list is ambitious . obama is n't expected to unveil a major peace plan , but the four-day visit will help define the two-term president 's legacy in the mideast .
according to officials of the united states state department , many human rights abuses in saddam hussein 's iraq were largely carried out in person or by the orders of saddam hussein and eleven other people . the term `` saddam 's dirty dozen '' was coined in october 2002 -lrb- from a novel by e.m. nathanson , later adapted as a film directed by robert aldrich -rrb- and used by us officials to describe this group . most members of the group held high positions in the iraqi government and membership went all the way from saddam 's personal guard to saddam 's sons . the list was used by the bush administration to help argue that the 2003 iraq war was against saddam hussein and the baath party leadership , rather than against the iraqi people . the guards at the baghdad detention facility called their prisoner `` vic , '' which stands for ` very important criminal ' , and let him plant a small garden near his cell . the nickname and the garden are among the details about the former iraqi leader that emerged during a march 2008 tour of the baghdad prison and cell where saddam slept , bathed , and kept a journal and wrote poetry in the final days before his execution ; he was concerned to ensure his legacy and how the history would be told . the tour was conducted by u.s. marine maj. gen. doug stone , overseer of detention operations for the u.s. military in iraq at the time . reports circulated that saddam 's behavior was `` submissive '' and that he was carrying the qur ` an he had been keeping with him throughout his trial before his execution . al-rubaie , who was a witness to saddam 's execution , described saddam as repeatedly shouting `` down with the invaders '' . al-rubaie reportedly asked saddam if he had any remorse or fear , to which saddam replied :

bush-appointee corporation for public broadcasting chairman kenneth tomlinson was a regular critic of moyers ; in 2003 , he wrote to pat mitchell , the president of pbs , that now with bill moyers `` does not contain anything approaching the balance the law requires for public broadcasting .

bradbury 's lifelong passion for books began at an early age . after graduating from high school , bradbury 's family could not afford for him to attend college so bradbury began spending time at the los angeles public library where he essentially educated himself . as a frequent visitor to his local libraries in the 1920s and 1930s , he recalls being disappointed because they did not stock popular science fiction novels , like those of h. g. wells , because , at the time , they were not deemed literary enough . between this and learning about the destruction of the library of alexandria , a great impression was made on the young man about the vulnerability of books to censure and destruction . bradbury described himself as `` a preventor of futures , not a predictor of them . '' he did not believe that book burning was an inevitable part of the future ; he wanted to warn against its development . in a later interview , when asked if he believes that teaching fahrenheit 451 in schools will prevent his totalitarian vision of the future , bradbury replied in the negative . rather , he states that education must be at the kindergarten and first-grade level . bradbury was among the early supporters of the egypt exploration fund -lrb- eef -rrb- , founded in 1882 to support british excavations in egypt . her friend , the journalist and traveller amelia edwards , was a founder member of the eef , and in 1890 bradbury accompanied her on a lecture tour of america , where edwards was promoting and fundraising for the eef . she was a committee member and one of the fund 's local secretaries , helping to gather subscriptions in britain on the fund 's behalf .
mike joyce of the washington post wrote that `` amish paradise '' was `` by far the cleverest and funniest track that bad hair day has to offer it ranks right up there with such yankovic classics as ` another one rides the bus , ' ` smells like nirvana ' and ` eat it . ' '' he also enjoyed `` gump '' , but felt that the remainder of the parodies were weak , particularly citing `` cavity search '' as `` a sophomoric attempt to extract yuks '' . however , joyce noted that `` some of the biggest laugh-getters '' on the album were yankovic 's originals . a record review from the pittsburgh post-gazette concluded that '' ` weird al ' yankovic 's ninth collection of original songs and parodies reinforces his reign as pop music 's king of comedy '' , and that the record `` showcases yankovic 's unparalleled ability to capture the styles of other bands and turn boring pop songs into fun tunes . '' yankovic considers his body of work to primarily feature parodies , rather than satires of the original song or artist , as he found that satire of songs or artists has already been done before . most yankovic songs consist of the original song 's music , with a separate , unrelated set of amusing lyrics . yankovic 's humor normally lies more in creating unexpected incongruity between an artist 's image and the topic of the song , contrasting the style of the song with its content -lrb- such as the songs `` amish paradise '' , `` white & nerdy '' , and `` you 're pitiful '' -rrb- , or in pointing out trends or works which have become pop culture clichés -lrb- such as `` ebay '' and `` do n't download this song '' -rrb- . yankovic 's parodies are often satirical of popular culture , including television -lrb- see the tv album -rrb- , movies -lrb- `` the saga begins '' -rrb- , and food -lrb- see the food album -rrb- . on august 4 , yankovic began recording parodies starting with `` living with a hernia '' . the song , a spoof of `` living in america '' by james brown -- which was also the theme to the 1985 film rocky iv -- is about hernias . when it came time to pick a song to parody as the lead single for polka party ! scotti brothers records `` had some very strong ideas '' and wished to have yankovic parody a musician who was signed on the same label .

'' anthony scaramucci is out as white house communications director , the latest sign of chaos inside the trump administration . scaramucci 's ouster is the most recent high-profile departure from the trump white house . chief of staff reince priebus resigned at the end of last week , replaced by john kelly , whose first day is monday . `` anthony scaramucci will be leaving his role as white house communications director , '' white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said in a statement monday afternoon . anthony scaramucci , the new white house communications director who was brought in to bring order to a press shop in turmoil , called into cnn 's `` new day '' on thursday and all but blamed chief of staff reince priebus for leaking information . in the remarkable interview , which lasted for more than a half hour , the developing power struggle inside the west wing was on full display , with scaramucci at one point warning that `` the fish stinks from the head down . '' scaramucci , whose relationship with priebus has been fraught since he was initially unable to secure a white house job after president donald trump 's election , did little to show his relationship with priebus was changing and said it was up to the chief of staff to show he was not leaking . hours earlier , the white house communications director -- who notably announced last week that he reports to trump , not priebus -- copied the chief of staff in a tweet about leaks before deleting it .
thanksgiving is looking up for natalie dubose , the ferguson entrepreneur whose bakery was trashed by rowdy protesters overnight monday . dubose owns natalie 's cakes and more , and has raised more than $ 84,000 since creating a crowdfunding page tuesday afternoon to rebuild her business . `` i am just so grateful for all the love and support that 's been showed to me , '' she told cnnmoney after learning that another $ 30,000 had been added to the site since the last time she checked . -lrb- she was too busy baking to monitor it . -rrb- president obama celebrated his favorite holiday -- thanksgiving -- with phone calls to u.s. troops , something he often does to mark the holiday . he spoke with representatives from the army , air force , marines , navy and coast guard to express his appreciation for their service , including their work to stamp out ebola and to defeat isis . the first family , joined by other family members , was set to feast on a dinner of thyme-roasted turkey , honey-baked ham , cornbread stuffing , oyster stuffing , braised winter greens , sweet potato gratin , mashed potatoes , green bean casserole , dinner rolls and macaroni and cheese . mac and cheese also happened to be the names of the two 20-week old , 48-pound turkeys the president pardoned on wednesday as part of the 67th anniversary of the national thanksgiving turkey . as we all know , thanksgiving is n't always the harmonious holiday it 's sometimes made out to be . stick a bunch of relatives together in the same house , add menu planning and alcohol , and things can get a little snippy . many people have strong opinions about how to cook the turkey , what side dishes to serve and who has to clean up . family traditions die hard and new ideas are n't always welcome .
another publicly discussed aspect of jackson 's private life is his childhood , particularly his relationship with his father , joseph . although jackson credited his father 's strict discipline with playing a large role in his success , he and some of his siblings said they were physically and mentally abused by joseph from a young age through incessant rehearsals , whippings , and the use of derogatory names such as `` big nose '' for michael ; this abuse affected michael throughout his life . in one altercation -- later recalled by marlon jackson -- joseph held michael upside down by one leg and `` pummeled him over and over again with his hand , hitting him on his back and buttocks . '' joseph would often trip the boys or push them into walls . sycamore valley ranch -lrb- formerly and most famously neverland ranch , or simply neverland -rrb- is a developed property in santa barbara county , california , located at 5225 figueroa mountain road , los olivos , california , on the edge of los padres national forest . it is known for being the home and private amusement park of american entertainer michael jackson from 1988 . originally named zaca laderas ranch , the estate was renamed to sycamore valley ranch shortly after it was purchased by property developer william bone in 1981 . in 1988 , the ranch was sold to jackson , who renamed it after neverland , the fantasy island in the story of peter pan , a boy who never grows up . jackson 's first encounter with the ranch came when he visited paul mccartney , who was staying there during their filming of the `` say say say '' video . jackson founded the heal the world foundation in 1992 . the charity brought underprivileged children to jackson 's ranch to use the theme park rides , and sent millions of dollars around the globe to help children threatened by war , poverty , and disease . that july , jackson published his second book , dancing the dream , a collection of poetry . the dangerous world tour ran between june 1992 and november 1993 and grossed $ 100 million ; jackson performed for 3.5 million people in 70 concerts , all of which were outside the us .
in 1969 , blakely 's controversial role as jesus christ in dennis potter 's son of man gained him wide recognition . from that time onwards , he was a regular on british television , and in the same year played the leading role in a bbc adaptation of anthony trollope 's the way we live now . blakely initially handled all aspects of the business , including marketing , logistics and product positioning , preferring the location of spanx alongside shoes in retail outlets , rather than in hosiery sections ; however , her boyfriend at the time , a healthcare consultant , later resigned from his job and joined in the running of the nascent business . blakely was contacting friends and acquaintances , including those from her past , and asking them to seek out her products at select department stores in exchange for a check that she would send to them by mail as a token of appreciation . she managed to arrange a meeting with a representative of the neiman marcus group , at which she changed into the product in the ladies restroom in the presence of the neiman marcus buyer to prove the benefits of her innovation . blakely 's product was sold in seven neiman marcus stores as a result of the meeting ; bloomingdales , saks , and bergdorf goodman soon followed . at around this time , blakely sent a basket of products to oprah winfrey 's television program , with a gift card that explained what she was attempting to develop .
the united states census of 1980 , conducted by the census bureau , determined the resident population of the united states to be 226,545,805 , an increase of 11.4 percent over the 203,184,772 persons enumerated during the 1970 census . it was the first census in which a state -- california -- recorded a population of 20 million people , as well as the first in which all states recorded populations of over 400,000 . the census bureau estimates that in 1970 over six percent of african americans went uncounted , whereas only around two percent of european americans went uncounted . democrats often argue that modern sampling techniques should be used so that more accurate and complete data can be inferred . republicans often argue against such sampling techniques , stating the u.s. constitution requires an `` actual enumeration '' for apportionment of house seats , and that political appointees would be tempted to manipulate the sampling formulas . the district of columbia announced in august 2011 that it would also challenge its census results . the mayor 's office claimed that the detailed information provided for 549 census blocks is `` nonsensical '' , listing examples of census data that show housing units located in the middle of a street that does not actually exist . however , officials do not believe the city 's total population will drastically change as a result of the challenge .
robert durst 's wife mysteriously disappeared decades ago . it 's an unsolved case that has n't stopped haunting him . years after she went missing , prosecutors argued durst was hiding out from investigators digging into that case when he killed a neighbor , dismembered the body and skipped town . jurors acquitted him in a high-profile 2003 murder trial after his lawyers said he 'd acted in self-defense . in early 2015 , a six-part hbo documentary titled the jinx : the life and deaths of robert durst described circumstantial evidence linking durst to the murder of berman , who was believed to have knowledge of mccormack 's disappearance . the documentary detailed the disappearance of mccormack , berman 's subsequent death , and the killing of black . against the advice of his lawyers and his wife debrah lee charatan , durst gave multiple interviews and unrestricted access to his personal records to the filmmakers . the fbi arrested durst in new orleans on the same day as the final episode was broadcast . millionaire real estate heir robert durst was `` lying in wait '' when he shot and killed his longtime friend because she `` was a witness to a crime , '' prosecutors alleged monday . the evidence behind that accusation was n't revealed in the los angeles county district attorney 's court filing , which charged durst with first-degree murder . if he 's convicted in the december 2000 killing of susan berman , prosecutors said , he could face the death penalty . the charges , filed two days after fbi agents arrested durst in new orleans , set the stage for a new courtroom battle for a man who 's no stranger to run-ins with the law .
the tenement has been designed by the architect rudolf kern , a student of józef święcicki , for his own use , private and business : he has lived there until 1922 . in 1634 , fr . andrew white of the society of jesus established a mission in what is now the state of maryland , and the purpose of the mission , stated through an interpreter to the chief of an indian tribe there , was `` to extend civilization and instruction to his ignorant race , and show them the way to heaven '' . fr . andrew 's diaries report that by 1640 , a community had been founded which they named st. mary 's , and the indians were sending their children there `` to be educated among the english '' . on august 29 , 1911 , ishi , generally considered to have been the last native american to live most of his life without contact with european-american culture , was discovered near oroville , california .
she is often the subject of media ridicule and parody and is frequently impersonated on shows such as madtv , saturday night live , south park , royal canadian air farce , and this hour has 22 minutes for her strong accent and on-stage gesticulations . however , she has stated that she is unaffected by the comments , and is flattered that people take the time to impersonate her . she even invited ana gasteyer , who parodied her on snl , to appear on stage during one of her performances in new york . while she is rarely politically outspoken , in 2005 following the hurricane katrina disaster , dion appeared on larry king live and tearfully criticized the us government 's slow response in aiding the victims of the hurricane : `` there 's people still there waiting to be rescued . after releasing and promoting thirteen albums during the 1990s , dion stated that she needed to settle down , and announced on her latest album all the way ... a decade of song , that she needed to take a step back from the spotlight and enjoy life . angélil 's diagnosis with esophageal cancer also prompted her to hiatus . while on break , she was unable to escape the spotlight . in 2000 , the national enquirer published a false story about the singer . she is also credited for both revitalizing and revolutionizing the entertainment scene in las vegas with the gargantuan successes of her residencies there . she managed to re-popularize the las vegas `` residency '' as a desirable way for top artists to essentially tour in place , letting their fans come to them . over the years , fellow established icons such as elton john , bette midler , rod stewart , cher , and shania twain followed suit . according to gary bongiovanni , president and editor-in-chief of pollstar `` celine redefined what artists can do in las vegas , helping to make it arguably the busiest entertainment city in the world . ''
thirty percent of the university 's endowment comes from permanent university fund -lrb- puf -rrb- , with nearly $ 15 billion in assets as of 2007 . the university of texas system gets two-thirds of the available university fund , the annual distribution of puf income . a regental policy requires at least 45 percent of this money go to the university for `` program enrichment . '' by taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent , ut gets 30 percent which is the minimum amount of auf income that can be distributed to the school under current policies . the regents , however , can decide to allocate additional amounts to the university . texas 's secession from the union and the american civil war delayed repayment of the borrowed monies . at the end of the civil war in 1865 , the university of texas 's endowment was just over $ 16,000 in warrants and nothing substantive had been done to organize the university 's operations . this effort to establish a university was again mandated by article 7 , section 10 of the texas constitution of 1876 which directed the legislature to `` establish , organize and provide for the maintenance , support and direction of a university of the first class , to be located by a vote of the people of this state , and styled `` the university of texas . '' the 1876 constitution also revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the act of 1858 , but dedicated 1,000,000 acres -lrb- 400,000 ha -rrb- of land , along with other property appropriated for the university , to the permanent university fund . this was greatly to the detriment of the university as the lands the constitution of 1876 granted the university represented less than 5 % of the value of the lands granted to the university under the act of 1858 -lrb- the lands close to the railroads were quite valuable , while the lands granted the university were in far west texas , distant from sources of transportation and water -rrb- . the more valuable lands reverted to the fund to support general education in the state -lrb- the special school fund -rrb- .
jon bon jovi stated that even though the album was their darkest , the band was in a very happy place at the time . `` hey god '' was written by jon bon jovi and richie sambora in jon bon jovi 's basement . jon bon jovi was inspired by the view out of the window from 57th st. and broadway in new york , a guy with an armani suit on next to a guys that 's sleeping on the street . `` something for the pain '' was the most difficult to write , says jon bon jovi . david bryan had quit the band that he and bon jovi had founded in order to study medicine . while in college , he realized that he wanted to pursue music full-time , and was accepted to juilliard school , a new york music school . when bon jovi called his friend and said that he was putting together a band , and a record deal looked likely , bryan followed bon jovi 's lead and gave up his studies . in november 2014 , jon bon jovi told a reporter that sambora had officially left the band , saying `` he 's quit . he 's gone . no hard feelings . '' that november , he also revealed that he was finishing writing songs for the band 's next studio album , their first without sambora , who was unofficially replaced by touring guitarist phil x. sambora has since stated that `` there 's no bad blood with me any more .
bush appeared on nbc 's the tonight show with jay leno on november 19 , 2013 , along with the former first lady , laura bush . when asked by leno why he does not comment publicly about the obama administration , bush said , `` i do n't think it 's good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor . '' despite this statement , on april 25 , 2015 , bush criticized president obama at a meeting of the republican jewish coalition at the venetian hotel in las vegas . bush criticized obama 's handling of iran , specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal , saying : `` you think the middle east is chaotic now ? president bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of america 's most serious social problems . he often used the `` thousand points of light '' theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems . in his 1989 inaugural address , president bush said , `` i have spoken of a thousand points of light , of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the nation , doing good . '' during his presidency , bush honored numerous volunteers with the daily point of light award , a tradition that was continued by his presidential successors . the september 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in bush 's presidency . that evening , he addressed the nation from the oval office , promising a strong response to the attacks . he also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims . three days after the attacks , bush visited ground zero and met with mayor rudy giuliani , firefighters , police officers , and volunteers .
santa cruz -lrb- ; spanish for holy cross -rrb- is the county seat and largest city of santa cruz county , california . as of 2018 the u.s. census bureau estimated santa cruz 's population at 64,725 . situated on the northern edge of monterey bay , about 32 mi -lrb- 51 km -rrb- south of san jose and 75 mi -lrb- 120 km -rrb- south of san francisco , the city is part of the 12-county san jose-san francisco-oakland combined statistical area . santa cruz is known for its moderate climate , natural environment , coastline , redwood forests , alternative community lifestyles , and socially liberal leanings .

another aspect of early european cannon is that they were rather small , dwarfed by the bombards which would come later . in fact , it is possible that the cannon used at crecy were capable of being moved rather quickly as there is an anonymous chronicle that notes the guns being used to attack the french camp , indicating that they would have been mobile enough press the attack . these smaller cannon would eventually give way to larger , wall breaching guns by the end of the 1300s . as part of his severance package from pathé , golan took the rights to marvel 's characters spider-man and captain america -lrb- golan was able to put captain america into production , and released it directly to video through his 21st century film corporation , while , as aforementioned , columbia would eventually take spider-man to production for 2002 release -rrb- . not to let that pre-production work go to waste , pyun wrote cyborg , with chuck norris in mind , suggesting it to cannon films . jean-claude van damme was cast in the lead role . some television stations still give the film 's title as masters of the universe 2 : cyborg . film critic roger ebert said of golan-globus in 1987 , `` no other production organization in the world today -- certainly not any of the seven hollywood ` majors ' -- has taken more chances with serious , marginal films than cannon . '' that year , cannon gained its greatest artistic success : its 1986 dutch production the assault won the 1987 academy award for best foreign language film and a golden globe award for best foreign language film . meanwhile , otello , based on the opera of the same name , also received a golden globe nomination that year .
republican sen. roy blunt said wednesday that president donald trump 's decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military `` deserves more than a twitter conversation . '' trump announced through his twitter account on wednesday that the military would not accept `` transgender individuals to serve in any capacity , '' citing the costs and disruption allowing them to serve would entail . the move reverses the obama administration 's decision made in 2016 to allow transgender individuals to serve openly . defense secretary james mattis recently said the defense department was delaying the obama administration 's decision to study the issue further . instead of using existing defense department historians , mcnamara assigned his close aide and assistant secretary of defense john t. mcnaughton to collect the papers . mcnaughton died in a plane crash one month after work began in june 1967 , but the project continued under the direction of defense department official leslie h. gelb . thirty-six analysts -- half of them active-duty military officers , the rest academics and civilian federal employees -- worked on the study . the analysts largely used existing files in the office of the secretary of defense . secretary of defense james mattis has informed congress that the us is withholding $ 50 million in funding from pakistan because he was unable to certify that islamabad `` has taken sufficient action against the haqqani network , '' a branch of the afghan taliban . such certification is necessary in order to enable pakistan to receive reimbursement of `` coalition support funds '' for 2016 . the funds are used to reimburse pakistan for the cost of military operations against terrorist groups during 2016 . there was about $ 50 million remaining in the funds , which will now be repurposed the pentagon said .
harrison 's cabinet choices alienated pivotal republican operatives from new york to pennsylvania to iowa and prematurely compromised his political power and future . senator shelby cullom 's described harrison 's steadfast aversion to the use of federal positions for patronage , stating , `` i suppose harrison treated me as well as he did any other senator ; but whenever he did anything for me , it was done so ungraciously that the concession tended to anger rather than please . '' harrison began the process of forming a cabinet by choosing to delay the nomination of james g. blaine as secretary of state . harrison felt that blaine had , as president james garfield 's secretary of state-designate , held too much power in choosing the personnel of the garfield administration , and he sought to avoid a similar scenario . in 2012 , atlanta public schools produced a documentary to honor the 50th anniversary of the district 's desegregation efforts . in january 1972 , in order to settle several federal discrimination and desegregation lawsuits filed on behalf of minority students , faculty , and employees and reach satisfactory agreement with atlanta civil rights leaders who had worked over a decade for a peaceful integration plan . atlanta public schools entered into a voluntary agreement with the u.s. department of justice , with approval and oversight from the u.s. department of education , in an attempt to desegregate atlanta public schools . in the late 1960s and early 1970s , a majority of atlanta northside public schools had either token integration , or none at all . the united states army had also been largely neglected since the civil war , despite the continuing american indian wars . when harrison took office , there were roughly 28,000 officers and enlisted men , and much of the equipment was inferior to that of european armies . secretary of war proctor sought to institute several reforms , including an improved diet and the granting of furloughs , resulting in a decline of the desertion rate . promotions for officers began to be granted based on the branch of service rather than on a regimental basis , and those subject to promotion were required to pass examinations .
harbaugh was born in crestline , ohio , to marie evelyn -lrb- née fisher -rrb- and william avon harbaugh . he is of german and irish descent . he graduated from crestline high school in 1957 . at crestline , he was a four-year letterman in both football and baseball . crestline high school is a public high school in crestline , ohio , united states . it is the only high school in the crestline exempted village school district . crestline high school is a public high school in crestline , ohio , united states . it is the only high school in the crestline exempted village school district .
in 1918 three professional groups , the national association of state supervisors and inspectors of rural schools , the county superintendent section of the nea , and the national association of personnel engaged in preparation of rural educators joined the department of rural education . for the first time , agricultural education was no longer included in the title of the organization and there was an evident change in the leadership of the organization in the succeeding ten years . during that period , only six of the presidents were from colleges or universities and only one of those six was associated with an agricultural school . the other presidents of the department of rural education were school administrators . following large increases in the number of women in higher education in the late nineteenth century , the number of deans of women also grew , establishing it as a professional occupation . in 1913 a graduate study program was created at teachers college , columbia university for deans of women . realising that an organisation was needed to coordinate training and connections for deans , in 1915 kathryn sisson phillips initiated informal meetings for the 26 women studying for the position at teachers college for discussions , with their first formal meeting occurring at a meeting of the national education association on july 6 , 1916 . the association had begun publishing a yearbook by 1923 and a scholarly journal in 1938 , the latter of which was edited by ruth strang . in 1968 the association became the rural education association , and in the following year cuis elected its last president . it appears that the two groups that had been meeting together apparently merged their meeting dates , their leaders , and their goals . the growth of the adversary relationship between teachers ' organizations and administrators must have resulted in an uncomfortable relationship between the rural education association and its sponsoring organization , the national rural education association . the rural department had expanded over the years to include county and intermediate superintendents and the leadership of the organization most often was from the ranks of administrators or representatives of higher education .
in 2009 , osterman posed nude along with three of her olympic teammates for the first annual the body issue of espn the magazine . of the shoot , osterman said that it was a `` surprisingly emotional experience '' and that `` even though i was terrified on set at first , i 'm glad i did it . sometimes it 's necessary to push yourself to see what you are made of . '' alpha to omega : exposing the osterman weekend is a 2004 documentary about the making of the osterman weekend . it was included as a special feature on anchor bay entertainment 's 2004 dvd release of the film . featuring interviews with many members of the cast and crew , it not only examines the process of bringing ludlum 's novel to the screen , but also provides a portrait of peckinpah 's approach to the filmmaking process and of his frame of mind and physical health following years of substance abuse . it was directed by jonathan gaines , who co-wrote it with michael thau , who was also the editor . it now became evident to la chetardie that only a revolution would overthrow osterman , and this he proposed to promote by elevating to the throne the tsesarevna elizabeth , who hated the vice-chancellor because , though he owed everything to her father , he had systematically neglected her . osterman was therefore the first and the most illustrious victim of the coup d'état of 6 december 1741 . accused , among other things , of contributing to the elevation of the empress anne by his cabals and of suppressing a supposed will of catherine i made in favour of her daughter elizabeth of russia , he threw himself on the clemency of the new empress . he was condemned first to be broken on the wheel and then beheaded ; but , reprieved on the scaffold , his sentence was commuted to lifelong banishment , with his whole family , to berezov in siberia , where he died six years later , in 1747 .
when roosevelt read book , he came ... no one ever helped as he did . for two years we were brothers in -lrb- new york city 's crime-ridden -rrb- mulberry street . when he left i had seen its golden age ... there is very little ease where theodore roosevelt leads , as we all of us found out . one of the first individuals to conceptualise propaganda by the deed was the italian revolutionary carlo pisacane -lrb- 1818 -- 57 -rrb- , who wrote in his `` political testament '' -lrb- 1857 -rrb- that `` ideas spring from deeds and not the other way around . '' mikhail bakunin -lrb- 1814 -- 1876 -rrb- , in his `` letters to a frenchman on the present crisis '' -lrb- 1870 -rrb- stated that `` we must spread our principles , not with words but with deeds , for this is the most popular , the most potent , and the most irresistible form of propaganda . '' the concept , in a broader setting , has a rich heritage , as the words of francis of assisi reveal : `` let them show their love by the works they do for each other , according as the apostle says : ` let us not love in word or in tongue , but in deed and in truth . ' '' the night begins , and zach easily checks off the first item on the list , drink beer in front of the cops , by pouring a beer into a coffee cup and consuming it in front of them . this way , the cops , who are determined to stop all those who attempt the deeds , have no idea of zach 's intentions of completing the list . as zach attempts the nine remaining deeds , the jocks do everything in their power to prevent him from completing it . throughout his crazy night , zach enlists the help of those around him to accomplish the difficult tasks .
the persecution of christians can be historically traced from the first century of the christian era to the present day . early christians were persecuted for their faith at the hands of both the jews from whose religion christianity arose and the romans who controlled many of the lands across which early christianity was spread . early in the fourth century , a form of the religion was legalized by the edict of milan , and it eventually became the state church of the roman empire . christian missionaries as well as converts to christianity have been the target of persecution ever since the emergence of christianity , sometimes to the point of being martyred for their faith .
nevertheless , kline was hired to play the protagonist , as reitman considered him to have a presidential look and be an actor `` who was both dramatically strong and was light on his feet , '' as kline would not only be playing a double role but the film was a comedy that dealt with very serious subject matter . reitman then called sigourney weaver , with whom he had worked in ghostbusters , for the first lady role . ross was present for production , as he was interested in starting a directing career as well . dave 's enthusiasm revives mitchell 's popularity . he visits a homeless shelter with ellen , who does not understand why he has taken a sudden interest . bob forges mitchell 's veto of a funding bill that includes the shelter . when dave is confronted about the veto by ellen , he confronts bob , who offhandedly tells him that if he can cut $ 650 million from the federal budget he can keep the shelter . the public is notified that mitchell has had a `` minor circulatory problem of the head '' . with dave established as president , bob and alan send nance on a 12-nation goodwill tour of africa and implicate him in savings and loan fraud . once nance is forced to resign , bob plans for dave to nominate him as vice president , whereupon mitchell will have a more serious stroke and bob will ascend to the presidency .
in its first 20 years , the zoo experienced many financial difficulties , and despite selling 22 acres -lrb- 8.9 ha -rrb- to pay off debt in 1886 , it went into receivership in 1898 . in order to prevent the zoo from being liquidated , the stockholders chose to give up their interests of the $ 225,000 they originally invested . for the next two years , the zoo was run under the cincinnati zoological company as a business . in 1901 , the cincinnati traction company , purchased the zoo , hoping to use it as a way to market itself to potential customers . a new aquarium was conceived in 2009 . it was originally envisioned as a more ambitious 100,000 -- 125,000 square feet -lrb- 9,300 -- 11,600 m2 -rrb- facility that would cost more than $ 50 million . however , planning of various forms occurred since the defunct cleveland aquarium closed in 1985 . although there were competing interests , the driving force behind the project was jeffrey jacobs , a local developer who envisioned it as being part of the powerhouse , a complex he owned . taylor resigned as director of the 5-hectare zoo in sacramento to accept the directorship of the 70-hectare zoo in cleveland . in his memoirs , published in a newsletter , taylor described the cleveland metroparks zoo to be poorly managed and `` undistinguished '' when he assumed the position as its 9th director . he credits himself for improving the conditions for both animals and staff over his 24-year career in cleveland .

visa europe began suspending payments to wikileaks on december 7 , 2010 . the company said it was awaiting an investigation into ` the nature of its business and whether it contravenes visa operating rules ' -- though it did not go into details . in return datacell , the it company that enables wikileaks to accept credit and debit card donations , announced that it would take legal action against visa europe . on december 8 , the group anonymous performed a ddos attack on visa.com , bringing the site down . throughout this campaign , clinton was always leading in the polls , generally by large margins . in october , republican national committee `` operatives urg their party 's congressional candidates to cut loose from bob dole and press voters to maintain a republican majority '' and spent $ 4 million on advertising in targeted districts . with respect to the issues , dole promised a 15 % across-the-board reduction in income tax rates and made former congressman and supply side advocate jack kemp his running mate . bill clinton framed the narrative against dole early , painting him as a mere clone of unpopular house speaker newt gingrich , warning america that bob dole would work in concert with the republican congress to slash popular social programs , like medicare and social security , dubbed by clinton as `` dole-gingrich '' . bob dole 's tax-cut plan found itself under attack from the white house , who said it would `` blow a hole in the deficit , '' which had been cut nearly in half during his opponent 's term .
i trampled clumsily through the dense undergrowth , attempting in vain to go a full five minutes without getting snarled in the thorns that threatened my every move . it was my first field mission in the savannahs of the republic of guinea . the aim was to record and understand a group of wild chimpanzees who had never been studied before . these chimps are not lucky enough to enjoy the comforts of a protected area , but instead carve out their existence in the patches of forests between farms and villages .
president donald trump and russian president vladimir putin discussed the possibility of meeting at the white house during a phone call last month , the white house confirmed on monday . `` as the president himself confirmed on march 20 , hours after his last call with president putin , the two had discussed a bilateral meeting in the ` not-too-distant future ' at a number of potential venues , including the white house , '' white house deputy press secretary raj shah said in a statement . shah 's comment came after yuri ushakov , an aide to putin , said trump `` offered to hold the first meeting in washington , in the white house . '' `` if everything goes well , i hope that the americans will not give up their proposal to discuss the possibility of holding the summit . for the second year in a row , president trump is snubbing an annual celebration of the white house press corps . the president said in a radio interview that he is `` probably '' skipping the white house correspondents ' association 's annual dinner . then the association said it had been told by the white house that he will not be coming . `` the white house has informed us that the president does not plan to participate in this year 's dinner but that he will actively encourage members of the executive branch to attend and join us as we celebrate the first amendment , '' the group 's president , margaret talev , said friday morning . the author of a new book on the current state of affairs in the white house claims that kellyanne conway is the `` number one leaker '' in president donald trump 's white house . in a sunday interview with cnn 's jake tapper on `` state of the union , '' ronald kessler , the author of `` the trump white house : changing the rules of the game , '' claimed that the president 's counselor and former campaign manager leaks more information to the press than any other individual working in the white house . kessler told tapper that in at least one interview with conway , she forgot that they were on-the-record as she ripped into her fellow colleagues . according to kessler , conway said some of the most `` mean , cutting and honestly untrue '' things about former chief of staff reince priebus , and also `` dissed '' ivanka trump and jared kushner , the president 's senior advisor and son-in-law .
the cherokee -lrb- ; cherokee : ꭰꮒᏼꮻꮿꭲ , romanized : aniyvwiyaʔi , or cherokee : ꮳꮃꭹ , romanized : tsalagi -rrb- are one of the indigenous people of the southeastern woodlands of the united states . prior to the 18th century , they were concentrated in what is now southwestern north carolina , southeastern tennessee , edges of western south carolina , northeastern georgia and northeastern alabama.the cherokee language is part of the iroquoian language group . in the 19th century , james mooney , an american ethnographer , recorded one oral tradition that told of the tribe having migrated south in ancient times from the great lakes region , where other iroquoian-speaking peoples lived ; however , anthropologist thomas r. whyte writes that the origin of the proto-iroquoian language was likely the appalachian region and the split between northern and southern iroquoian languages began 4,000 years ago.by the 19th century , european settlers in the united states classified the cherokee of the southeast as one of the `` five civilized tribes '' , because they were agrarian and lived in permanent villages and began to adopt some cultural and technological practices of the european american settlers . today there are three federally recognized cherokee tribes : the eastern band of cherokee indians in north carolina , the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians -lrb- ukb -rrb- in oklahoma , and the cherokee nation -lrb- cn -rrb- in oklahoma.the cherokee nation has more than 300,000 tribal members , making it the largest of the 567 federally recognized tribes in the united states . native americans , also known as american indians , indigenous americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the united states , except hawaii and territories of the united states . more than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the us , about half of which are associated with indian reservations . the term `` american indian '' excludes native hawaiians and some alaskan natives , while `` native americans '' -lrb- as defined by the us census -rrb- are american indians , plus alaska natives of all ethnicities . the us census does not include native hawaiians or chamorro , instead being included in the census grouping of `` native hawaiian and other pacific islander '' . the indian removal act was signed into law on may 28 , 1830 , by united states president andrew jackson . the law authorized the president to negotiate with southern native american tribes for their removal to federal territory west of the mississippi river in exchange for white settlement of their ancestral lands . the act has been referred to as a unitary act of systematic genocide , because it discriminated against an ethnic group in so far as to make certain the death of vast numbers of its population . the act was signed by andrew jackson and it was strongly enforced under his administration and that of martin van buren , which extended until 1841 . the act was strongly supported by southern and northeastern populations , but was opposed by native tribes and the whig party .
following the departures of holetz and russell , it was believed that the band briefly recruited bjelland 's friend and former bandmate , courtney love , on bass , as love claimed to have been `` kicked out '' of the band . however , during a 2015 interview , bjelland and barbero refuted this , with barbero stating : `` she lived in my house , and one time i think when we were rehearsing she came down and probably picked up something and tried to play and we were just like , `` get out of here . '' however , michelle leon , who was hired as the group 's bass player , claimed that she was briefly replaced by love as bassist shortly after joining . after the group rehearsed with love on `` a couple '' of occasions , leon stated barbero called her and asked her to re-join the band . in 1993 , the band was chosen to take part in that year 's lollapalooza tour , playing alongside such acts as primus , alice in chains , dinosaur jr. and rage against the machine . during dates at lollapalooza , the band released their third and final ep , painkillers , in june 1993 . in 1994 , journalist neal karlen began writing babes in toyland : the making and selling of a rock and roll band , which dealt with the band 's signing to warner and the recording of fontanelle . commenting on the book in retrospect , bjelland said : `` i feel bad for . moore said of the pilot : `` there 's a lot of things we did in the first thirty to forty minutes that are n't in the book or are compilations of things that happened in the book '' . he emphasised that he did not want to present the time-travel dimension in a traditional special effects-laden science fiction manner . describing the adaptation of the first season as `` straightforward '' , he explained : `` it was always kind of clear what the basic structure was : claire 's trying to get home , then she meets this guy , now she 's falling in love , now she has a conflict , will she go home . you lay it out in a very linear fashion '' .
the palestinian people -lrb- arabic : الشعب الفلسطيني , ash-sha ` b al-filasṭīnī -rrb- , also referred to as palestinians -lrb- arabic : الفلسطينيون , al-filasṭīniyyūn , hebrew : פָלַסְטִינִים -rrb- or palestinian arabs -lrb- arabic : الفلسطينيين العرب , ạl-flsṭynyyn ạl-ʿrb -rrb- , are an ethnonational group comprising the modern descendants of the peoples who have lived in palestine continuously over the centuries and who today are largely culturally and linguistically arab ; this definition includes those ethnic jews and samaritans who fit this definition . despite various wars and exoduses -lrb- such as that in 1948 -rrb- , roughly one half of the world 's palestinian population continues to reside in historic palestine , the area encompassing the west bank , the gaza strip and israel . in this combined area , as of 2005 , palestinians constituted 49 % of all inhabitants , encompassing the entire population of the gaza strip -lrb- 1.865 million -rrb- , the majority of the population of the west bank -lrb- approximately 2,785,000 versus about 600,000 jewish israeli citizens , which includes about 200,000 in east jerusalem -rrb- and 20.95 % of the population of israel proper as arab citizens of israel . many are palestinian refugees or internally displaced palestinians , including more than a million in the gaza strip , about 750,000 in the west bank and about 250,000 in israel proper . israel -lrb- ; hebrew : יִשְׂרָאֵל ; arabic : إِسْرَائِيل -rrb- , also known as the state of israel -lrb- hebrew : מְדִינַת יִשְׂרָאֵל -rrb- , is a country in western asia , located on the southeastern shore of the mediterranean sea and the northern shore of the red sea . it has land borders with lebanon to the north , syria to the northeast , jordan on the east , the palestinian territories of the west bank and gaza strip to the east and west , respectively , and egypt to the southwest . the country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area . israel 's economic and technological center is tel aviv , while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is jerusalem , although the state 's sovereignty over jerusalem has only partial recognition.israel has evidence of the earliest migration of hominids out of africa . the israelites -lrb- ; hebrew : בני ישראל bnei yisra'el -rrb- were a confederation of iron age semitic-speaking tribes of the ancient near east , who inhabited a part of canaan during the tribal and monarchic periods . according to the religious narrative of the hebrew bible , the israelites ' origin is traced back to the biblical patriarchs and matriarchs abraham and his wife sarah , through their son isaac and his wife rebecca , and their son jacob who was later called israel , whence they derive their name , with his wives leah and rachel and the handmaids zilpa and bilhah . modern archaeology has largely shown that determining the historicity of the religious narrative is impossible , with many scholars viewing the stories as inspiring national myth narratives with little historical value . based on the archaeological evidence , according to the modern archaeological account , the israelites and their culture did not overtake the region by force , but instead branched out of the indigenous canaanite peoples that long inhabited the southern levant , syria , ancient israel , and the transjordan region through a gradual evolution of a distinct monolatristic -- later cementing as monotheistic -- religion centered on yahweh .

as of january 22 , 2020 , the doomsday clock stands at 100 seconds to midnight . it is the closest approach to midnight , after exceeding that of 1953 and 2018 . the decision to move the hand of the clock is made by the bulletin 's science and security board , which meets in person twice a year , with subcommittees meeting more often ; the announcement of the decision is made each january . each november , just prior to the science and security board 's fall discussion , the bulletin hosts an annual dinner and meeting in chicago ; both events are open to the public . the minute hand of the clock first moved closer to midnight in response to changing world events in 1949 , following the first soviet nuclear test . the clock has been set forward and back over the years as circumstances have changed ; as of 2020 it is set at 100 seconds to midnight . the doomsday clock is used to represent threats to humanity from a variety of sources : nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction , climate change , and disruptive technologies . in 2015 , the bulletin unveiled its doomsday dashboard , an interactive infographic that illustrates some of the data the bulletin 's science and security board takes into account when deciding the time of the clock each year . the doomsday clock is a symbol that represents the likelihood of a man-made global catastrophe . maintained since 1947 by the members of the bulletin of the atomic scientists , the clock is a metaphor for threats to humanity from unchecked scientific and technical advances . the clock represents the hypothetical global catastrophe as `` midnight '' and the bulletin 's opinion on how close the world is to a global catastrophe as a number of `` minutes '' to midnight , assessed in january of each year . the main factors influencing the clock are nuclear risk and climate change .
after the inaugural ceremony on the west front of the u.s. capitol , president obama , first lady michelle obama , vice president joe biden and dr. jill biden escorted former president george w. bush and former first lady laura bush to a departure ceremony on the east side of the u.s. capitol . before the luncheon and in keeping with tradition , president obama signed his first presidential orders in the president 's room at the capitol , and then signed the guest book for the luncheon . the first order signed by obama was a proclamation declaring his inauguration day a `` national day of renewal and reconciliation '' , in which he called `` upon all of our citizens to serve one another and the common purpose of remaking this nation for our new century '' . next , obama signed orders to officially present the nominations for his cabinet and several sub‑cabinet officials to the u.s. congress for its approval . later in 2011 , obama 's re-election campaign offered for sale mugs with a picture of obama -lrb- captioned `` made in the usa '' -rrb- and the image of the birth certificate . the campaign states , `` there 's really no way to make the conspiracy about president obama 's birth certificate completely go away , so we might as well laugh at it -- and make sure as many people as possible are in on the joke . '' obama concluded the second paragraph of his address by saying , `` we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents . '' the speech reinforced words such as `` legacy '' and `` heritage '' , as well as values such as `` honesty '' , `` courage '' and `` patriotism '' , which `` are old '' values . near the end of the speech , obama referred to words written by thomas paine in the american crisis , which were ordered by george washington to be read to his troops : `` let it be told to the future world ... that in the depth of winter , when nothing but hope and virtue could survive ... that the city and the country , alarmed at one common danger , came forth to meet . '' because obama 's campaign message focused on the need for change , mackin noted that obama sought to reassure americans that he would operate as president within the margins of the nation 's traditions .

new tariffs on china would make some apple products more expensive . that 's what the company told us trade representative robert lighthizer in a letter dated wednesday , a last-ditch appeal to avoid additional tariffs on chinese goods worth $ 200 billion that could go into effect as soon as friday . `` because all tariffs ultimately show up as a tax on us consumers , they will increase the cost of apple products that our customers have come to rely on in their daily lives , '' the company said . in addition to its apple watch and its wireless air pods , apple said tariffs would affect the apple pencil , homepod and macmini , along with adapters , cables and chargers . apple announced on september 1 , 2013 , that its iphone trade-in program would be implemented at all of its 250 specialty stores in the us . for the program to become available , customers must have a valid contract and must purchase a new phone , rather than simply receive credit to be used at a later date . a significant part of the program 's goal is to increase the number of customers who purchase iphones at apple stores rather than carrier stores . wall street 's response to apple 's annual product release on wednesday was , as one analyst described it , a yawn . the company unveiled a handful of new devices and modest updates , including three new versions of the iphone x and an apple watch with new features . all of that was expected . there was little fanfare .

in their 2007 book , authors junco and mastrodicasa expanded on the work of william strauss and neil howe to include research-based information about the personality profiles of millennials , especially as it relates to higher education . they conducted a large-sample -lrb- 7,705 -rrb- research study of college students . they found that next generation college students , born between 1983 -- 1992 , were frequently in touch with their parents and they used technology at higher rates than people from other generations . in their survey , they found that 97 % of these students owned a computer , 94 % owned a mobile phone , and 56 % owned an mp3 player . a 2004 gallup poll of americans aged 13 to 17 found that 71 % said their social and political views were more or less the same as those of their parents . 21 % thought they were more liberal and 7 % more conservative . according to demographer and public policy analyst philip longman , `` even among baby boomers , those who wound up having children have turned out to be remarkably similar to their parents in their attitudes about ` family ' values .

the pure food and drug act of 1906 was the first of a series of significant consumer protection laws which was enacted by congress in the 20th century and led to the creation of the food and drug administration . its main purpose was to ban foreign and interstate traffic in adulterated or mislabeled food and drug products , and it directed the u.s. bureau of chemistry to inspect products and refer offenders to prosecutors . it required that active ingredients be placed on the label of a drug 's packaging and that drugs could not fall below purity levels established by the united states pharmacopeia or the national formulary . the jungle by upton sinclair , with its graphic and revolting descriptions of unsanitary conditions and unscrupulous practices rampant in the meatpacking industry , was an inspirational piece that kept the public 's attention on the important issue of unhygienic meat processing plants that later led to food inspection legislation . the 1906 act paved the way for the eventual creation of the food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- and is generally considered to be that agency 's founding date , though the agency existed before the law was passed and was not named fda until later . `` while the food and drug act remains a foundational law of the fda mission , it 's not the law that created the fda . the bureau of chemistry -lrb- the precursor to the fda -rrb- regulated food safety . in 1927 , the bureau was reorganized into the food , drug , and insecticide administration and the bureau of chemistry and soils . after his resignation , from his post as commissioner of the food and drugs administration in december 1969 , dr. herbert l. ley , jr. . in an interview to the new york times , warned the public about the fda 's inability to safeguard consumers . people were being misled , he believed `` the thing that bugs me is that the people think the fda is protecting them - it is n't . what the fda is doing and what the public thinks it 's doing are as different as night and day , '' he said .

tucson , arizona -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the father of arizona massacre suspect jared lee loughner had a front-yard argument with his son the morning of the killings and had told a neighbor the 22-year-old was `` out of control , '' according to neighbors and investigators . the shaven-headed youth had quit a community college in october after being suspended and had been warned not to come back without a mental health evaluation . postings attributed to loughner on websites including myspace and youtube show `` classic signs of psychosis , '' one expert told cnn . loughner had complained for years about u.s. rep. gabrielle giffords -- the apparent target of saturday 's bloodbath , according to a law enforcement official . loughner 's high-school friend zach osler said , `` he did not watch tv ; he disliked the news ; he did n't listen to political radio ; he did n't take sides ; he was n't on the left ; he was n't on the right . '' the tone of loughner 's online writings and videos from immediately before the attack were described by the guardian as `` almost exclusively conservative and anti-government , with echoes of the populist campaigning of the tea party movement '' . some media commentators , such as howard kurtz and toby harnden , criticized what they perceived as a rush to judgment about the shooter 's motivation , disputing suggestions that the shooting was the result of the tea party movement or anything in connection to palin . paul krugman wrote an op-ed piece arguing that political rhetoric had become toxic . with renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after the shooting , keith olbermann said , `` violence , or the threat of violence , has no place in our democracy , and i apologize for and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence . '' jon stewart stated that he did not know whether or not the political environment contributed to the shooting , but , `` for all the hyperbole and vitriol that 's become a part of our political process -- when the reality of that rhetoric , when actions match the disturbing nature of words , we have n't lost our capacity to be horrified .
in december 2014 , peter jackson said that the tintin sequel would be made `` at some point soon '' , although he intended to focus on directing two new zealand films before that . the following year , anthony horowitz , who was hired as the sequel 's screenwriter even before the release of the first film , stated that he was no longer working on the sequel , and was unsure if it was still being made . in june 2016 , spielberg confirmed that the sequel was still in development , but jackson is working on a secret project in the meantime . released in 1994 after jackson won a race to bring the story to the screen , heavenly creatures marked a major change for jackson in terms of both style and tone . the film is based on the real parker -- hulme murder case in which two teenage girls in 1950s christchurch became close friends and later murdered the mother of one of the girls . it was fran walsh that persuaded him that these events had the makings of a movie ; jackson has been quoted saying that the film `` only got made '' because of her enthusiasm for the subject matter . the film 's fame coincided with the new zealand media tracking down the real-life juliet hulme , who now writes books under the name anne perry . `` hobbit '' mania is in full swing in new zealand this week , where all three of the peter jackson-directed movies based on the work of j.r.r. tolkien were filmed . wellington international airport has unveiled a new installation featuring two realistic `` great eagles '' from the `` the hobbit : the desolation of smaug , '' the second in the trilogy . the film 's world premier will take place on december 2 in los angeles .
lewis had no formal education until he was 13 years of age , but during his time in georgia he enhanced his skills as a hunter and outdoorsman . he would often venture out in the middle of the night in the dead of winter with only his dog to go hunting . even at an early age , he was interested in natural history , which would develop into a lifelong passion . his mother taught him how to gather wild herbs for medicinal purposes . in january 1889 , bowen left llanelli to take up a teaching post in bangor , north wales , though he kept a close connection with the club . he was remembered as a diligent captain who `` kept his eyes all over the field '' and held the ability to secure obedience from his fellow players . historian paul russell cutright wrote a detailed rebuttal of the murder robbery theory , concluding that it `` lacks legs to stand on '' . he stressed lewis 's debts , heavy drinking , possible morphine and opium use , failure to prepare the expedition 's journals for publication , repeated failure to find a wife , and the deterioration of his friendship with thomas jefferson . this refutation was countered by eldon g. chuinard , who argued for the murder hypothesis . leading lewis scholars donald jackson , jay h. buckley , clay s. jenkinson and others , have stated that , regardless of their leanings or beliefs , the facts of his death are not known , there are no eyewitnesses , and the reliability of reports of those in the place or vicinity can not be considered certain .

in the early 1960s , the department of defense and the central intelligence agency operated the ffrdc special operations research office as a think tank at american university . the government abandoned the think tank after its research was criticized as imperialistic by the general public . au 's political involvement was furthered by president john f. kennedy 's spring 1963 commencement address . in the speech , kennedy called on the soviet union to work with the united states to achieve a nuclear test ban treaty and to reduce the considerable international tensions and the specter of nuclear war during that juncture of the cold war . american university 's institutional feminist organizations include the women and politics institute in the school of public affairs . the institute announces its mission on their website as `` to close the gender gap in political leadership and provide young women with academic and practical training that encourages them to become involved in the political process and facilitates research by faculty and students that enhances their understanding of the challenges and opportunities women face in the political arena . '' the department of women 's , gender , and sexuality studies -lrb- wgss -rrb- within the college of arts and sciences is `` an interdisciplinary program encompassing feminist studies , masculinity studies , and sexuality studies . the program is committed to a multicultural curriculum that sustains and integrates diverse perspectives .

in 1950 , the family moved to brooklyn , first to an apartment at the corner of union street and franklin avenue , and later to a two-bedroom apartment at 560 lincoln place . it was there that `` fischer soon became so engrossed in the game that regina feared he was spending too much time alone '' . as a result , on november 14 , 1950 , regina sent a postcard to the brooklyn eagle newspaper , seeking to place an ad inquiring whether other children of bobby 's age might be interested in playing chess with him . the paper rejected her ad , because no one could figure out how to classify it , but forwarded her inquiry to hermann helms , the `` dean of american chess '' , who told her that master max pavey , former scottish champion , would be giving a simultaneous exhibition on january 17 , 1951 . nicholas ' acting potential was discovered at the age of three by a theatre director during a performance of a play that starred nicholas ' brother . the director was impressed at nicholas ' ability to `` concentrate well '' and offered him a role in his next theatre production , the caucasian chalk circle . hoult began attending auditions and at the age of five was cast in the 1996 drama intimate relations , his first feature-film role . he later appeared in the television programmes casualty , silent witness , the bill , judge john deed , and doctors , among others . when fischer was 16 , his mother moved out of their apartment to pursue medical training . her friend joan rodker , who had met regina when the two were `` idealistic communists '' living in moscow in the 1930s , believes that fischer resented his mother for being mostly absent as a mother , a communist activist and an admirer of the soviet union and that this led to his hatred for the soviet union . in letters to rodker , fischer 's mother states her desire to pursue her own `` obsession '' of training in medicine and writes that her son would have to live in their brooklyn apartment without her : `` it sounds terrible to leave a 16-year-old to his own devices , but he is probably happier that way '' . the apartment was on the edge of bedford-stuyvesant , a neighborhood that had one of the highest homicide and general crime rates in new york city .
the 1890 census was the first to be compiled using the new tabulating machines invented by herman hollerith . the net effect of the many changes from the 1880 census -lrb- the larger population , the number of data items to be collected , the census bureau headcount , the volume of scheduled publications , and the use of hollerith 's electromechanical tabulators -rrb- was to reduce the time required to fully process the census from eight years for the 1880 census to six years for the 1890 census . the total population , of 62,947,714 , was announced after only six weeks of processing -lrb- punched cards were not used for this family , or rough , count -rrb- . the public reaction to this tabulation was disbelief , as it was widely believed that the `` right answer '' was at least 75,000,000 . using the census bureau 's definition of the northeast , the region includes nine states : they are maine , new york , new jersey , vermont , massachusetts , rhode island , connecticut , new hampshire , and pennsylvania . the region is often subdivided into new england -lrb- the six states east of new york -rrb- and the mid-atlantic states -lrb- new york , new jersey , and pennsylvania -rrb- . this definition has been essentially unchanged since 1880 and is widely used as a standard for data tabulation . however , the census bureau has acknowledged the obvious limitations of this definition and the potential merits of a proposal created after the 1950 census that would include changing regional boundaries to include delaware , maryland , and the district of columbia , with the mid-atlantic states , but ultimately decided that `` the new system did not win enough overall acceptance among data users to warrant adoption as an official new set of general-purpose state groupings . although francis walker , the superintendent of the 1870 census , defended the quality of the census , arguing that standardized , clear , and statistical approaches and practices were carried out across all regions of the united states , the public at the time was disappointed in the national growth rate and suspected underenumeration . with especially bitter complaints coming from new york and philadelphia claiming up to a third of the population was not counted , the president made the rare move to order a recount in those areas . while it was thought a large fraction of the population was not counted for being indoors in the wintry cold , newer estimates resulted in only a 2.5 % increase in philadelphia 's population and a 2 % increase in new york 's .
writer jerry izenberg once noted that , `` the nation became ali 's family and elijah muhammad became his father . but there is an irony to the fact that while the nation branded white people as devils , ali had more white colleagues than most african american people did at that time in america , and continued to have them throughout his career . '' muhammad ali -lrb- ; born cassius marcellus clay jr. ; january 17 , 1942 -- june 3 , 2016 -rrb- was an american professional boxer , activist , and philanthropist . nicknamed `` the greatest , '' he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century and as one of the greatest boxers of all time . ali was born and raised in louisville , kentucky , and began training as an amateur boxer at age 12 . at 18 , he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 summer olympics , and turned professional later that year . the two bouts launched one man and ruined the other . for ali , this was the beginning of the ali mystique : the people 's hero confronting seeming impossible odds and insurmountable foes -lrb- both inside and outside the ring -rrb- only to triumph through his wit , integrity , courage and talent . for liston , the fights left his reputation in tatters . in just a little over one year , he went from being considered one of the most fearsome heavyweights of all-time to an overrated champion .

over approximately the next two decades , the other schools of the university , which were located at a separate campus at 96 schermerhorn street in downtown brooklyn , moved out to the new campus in queens . the last of the schools to relocate to queens moved there in 1972 , bringing an end to the downtown brooklyn campus of the university . in 1959 , the university established a freedom institute to provide lectures and programs that would focus , in the words of university president rev. john a. flynn , president , focus `` attention on the dangers of communism threatening free institutions here and abroad , '' with arpad f. kovacs of the st. john 's history department as its director . creative industries , which are concerned with generating and distributing knowledge and information , such as new media , digital media , film and television production , advertising , fashion , design , and architecture , account for a growing share of employment , with new york city possessing a strong competitive advantage in these industries . as of 2014 , new york state was offering tax incentives of up to $ 420 million annually for filmmaking within the state , the most generous such tax rebate among the u.s. states . new york has also attracted higher-wage visual-effects employment by further augmenting its tax credit to a maximum of 35 % for performing post-film production work in upstate new york . the filmed entertainment industry has been growing in new york , contributing nearly $ 9 billion to the new york city economy alone as of 2015 . suny and the city university of new york -lrb- cuny -rrb- are different university systems , both funded by new york state . also , suny is not to be confused with the university of the state of new york -lrb- usny -rrb- , which is the governmental umbrella organization for most education-related institutions and many education-related personnel -lrb- both public and private -rrb- in new york state , and which includes , as components , the new york state education department and the new york state university police .
at the end of this run of hamlet , barrymore traveled to paris , where oelrichs had stayed during his residence in london , but the reunion was not a happy one and the couple argued frequently . when he returned to america , she remained in paris , and the couple drew up a separation agreement that provided oelrichs with $ 18,000 a year and stated that neither could sue for divorce on the grounds of adultery . while he had been in london , warner bros and barrymore entered into a contact for three further films at a salary of $ 76,250 per picture . he later claimed that his motivation for moving from stage to films was the `` lack of repetition -- the continual playing of a part , which is so ruinous to an actor , is entirely eliminated '' . news of barrymore 's success in hamlet piqued the interest of warner bros. , which signed him as the lead in the 1924 film beau brummel . unhappy in his marriage , barrymore -- aged 40 at the time -- sought solace elsewhere and had an affair with his 17-year-old co-star mary astor during filming . although the film was not an unqualified success , the cast , including barrymore , was generally praised . around this time , barrymore acquired the nickname `` the great profile '' , as posters and photographs of him tended to favor the left-hand side . barrymore had always professed a dislike of the acting profession , but in 1900 he was persuaded by his father to join him on stage for a few performances of a short play , `` a man of the world '' . he appeared in the same piece again the following year , but he still thought of the experience as merely a way to supplement his income , rather than as a possible future career . in october 1901 , ethel was appearing in philadelphia in captain jinks of the horse marines when one of the younger actors became temporarily unavailable . she persuaded the director to allow barrymore to accept the part of the minor character , and barrymore traveled from new york , learning his lines on the train .
for a class project of nicky 's , danny mentioned that when he was three years old , he wanted to be a firefighter for halloween , but his grandfather henry swore that as long as he was alive , no reagan would ever be a member of the fdny , got him into a police uniform , and he `` never took it off '' until he made detective . on may 12 , 2017 , it was reported that sebastián lelio would direct a reimagining of his 2013 film gloria starring julianne moore . `` as one of the greatest actresses in the world , julianne giving her interpretation of the character is not only a huge honor , it 's irresistible . it 's going to be like jazz , you 'll feel the spirit of the original story but it 'll be re-invigorated and vital , '' said lelio . on november 16 , 2017 , it was reported that the film had begun production . the nypd deputy commissioner of public information , who becomes frank 's de facto chief of staff . before becoming frank 's dcpi , garrett was a reporter . he has been married and divorced three times , and has a stepson , whom he has tried to keep out of trouble . garrett and frank have a rather complex relationship ; for example , frank often expresses dismay when garrett comes into his office unannounced but also seemingly values his perspective .
president donald trump on monday praised judge brett kavanaugh as `` one of the finest people that i 've ever known '' in his first public comments since the supreme court nominee was publicly accused of sexual assault , and he criticized democrats for not releasing information about the allegation sooner . while he heaped praise on his nominee , trump said he supports going `` through a full process '' to `` hear everybody out '' on the matter and accepted the possibility that kavanaugh 's nomination could be delayed as a result . `` judge kavanaugh is one of the finest people that i 've ever known . he 's an outstanding intellect , an outstanding judge , respected by everybody . president donald trump said he would have pushed brett kavanaugh 's supreme court nomination through the senate two weeks ago if he were responsible for the proceedings . `` they could have pushed it through two weeks ago and we would n't be talking about this right now , which is what i would have preferred , '' trump said as he entered the united nations on wednesday . trump described kavanaugh as a `` gem '' who had been unfairly maligned . the senate judiciary committee has scheduled its vote on kavanaugh 's nomination for friday morning at 9:30 a.m. allies of brett kavanaugh are touting the performance the supreme court nominee and his wife gave monday evening on fox news as accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior from high school and college continue to threaten his nomination . the unprecedented decision to put a supreme court nominee in front of a camera before his confirmation came as the white house and outside groups work to put kavanaugh in a stronger position ahead of the senate judiciary committee hearing on thursday . christine blasey ford , who has accused kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both high school students , will also testify . president donald trump took perhaps his most aggressive stand in defense of kavanaugh to date on tuesday , when he cast doubt on the recollections of both the women accusing kavanaugh and slammed democrats for playing what he described as a `` con game .

modern jeans began to appear in the 1920s , but sales were largely confined to the working people of the western united states , such as cowboys , lumberjacks , and railroad workers . levi 's jeans apparently were first introduced to the east during the dude ranch craze of the 1930s , when vacationing easterners returned home with tales -lrb- and usually examples -rrb- of the hard-wearing pants with rivets . another boost came in world war ii , when blue jeans were declared an essential commodity and were sold only to people engaged in defense work . strauss opened his wholesale business as levi strauss & co. and imported fine dry goods from his brothers in new york , including clothing , bedding , combs , purses , and handkerchiefs . he made tents and later jeans while he lived with fanny 's growing family . jacob w. davis was one of his customers and one of the inventors of riveted denim pants in 1871 , and he went into business with strauss to produce blue jeans . the two men patented the new style of work pants in 1873 . low-rise jeans may be worn to display more skin at the waist , torso , and hips . accordingly , they are sometimes worn in combination with crop tops , giving a glimpse of skin between the jeans and the top , or -lrb- more commonly in the summer or in warmer countries -rrb- showing their entire midriff including the navel . from 2001 to 2007 , the low rise style frequently revealed the thong or g-string underneath , but after 2007 this fell out of favor and thongs began their decline . when the wearer sits down or bends forward , sometimes cleavage is visible .
anthony breznican of usa today also noted that `` kristen stewart 's shocking depiction of a self-destructive 16-year-old stripper/prostitute in welcome to the rileys is bound to scandalize . those who prefer her only as twilight 's lovestruck bella may be shocked , while others who know her more nuanced work in films such as adventureland will see a fearless new side of the actress confirmed . '' however , david edwards from the daily mirror says , `` it 's downbeat and has little to say about the grieving process , and while gandolfini and leo are memorable , stewart is not . '' while some critics criticized the direction , script , as well as performances , film critic roger ebert stated , `` one of the buzz champs of sundance 2010 . gandolfini demonstrates that although he may not be conventionally handsome , when he smiles his face bathes you in the urge to like him . kristen stewart here is tougher even than her punk rocker in the runaways . '' roger friedman of the hollywood reporter said , `` we got to see james gandolfini continue his whacking of tony soprano in a fine new drama called welcome to the rileys . mel is a local politician from a political family . when a family scandal leaves her niece , lennox , and nephew , ryder , without their parents , mel takes them in . meanwhile , joe is a former commodities trader left bankrupt after a ponzi scheme , and finds himself searching for a job . so when mel finds it hard to handle an instant family and her own life , she hires joe to become the family 's new male nanny , or `` manny '' .
in what could be his final state of the union address , president barack obama on tuesday will call keeping alive the american dream `` the defining issue of our time '' and pledge to fight obstruction by congressional republicans . the speech to a joint sitting of congress is an annual evening of political pageantry , but the stakes are higher this year with obama 's re-election on the line in november . according to excerpts released in advance by the white house , obama will frame the challenges facing the country as a choice between opportunity for some or giving everyone a chance to prosper . `` the defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive , '' the president will say , according to the excerpts . while reaching out to supporters through one of the latest high-tech means , president obama expanded his social media experience by holding a google + video chat room interview monday afternoon . in an election year , it 's probably not good politics to talk about what you look forward to doing after your time in the white house , but that 's exactly what president obama did when asked about the frustrations of living in the security bubble . `` it 's the toughest thing about being president . look , this is the greatest job on earth , and it 's such an honor to serve , but it is true sometimes , you get a little stir crazy , '' he said `` one of the things i look forward to after i 've had this extraordinary honor is just taking a walk or waking up on saturday morning , not shaving and going to the local starbucks and not having to worry about it . '' president barack obama launches a three-day swing through key election states wednesday after declaring in what could be his final state of the union address that the nation was strengthening but must confront the defining issue of preserving the american dream . in the speech tuesday night to a joint sitting of congress , obama offered both his administration 's priorities for the coming year and his campaign messaging for his re-election bid in november . read the president 's speech he defended a long list of his trademark policies -- tax increases on the wealthy , wall street reform , health care reform , government stimulus spending -- to applause from fellow democrats while also offering proposals of interest to republicans , such as corporate tax breaks and expanded oil and gas development . declaring `` the state of our union is getting stronger , '' obama said america had come too far in its still sluggish recover from economic recession `` to turn back now .

mars may seem inhospitably dry now , but nasa 's rovers have shown that water was once abundant on the red planet . photos gathered during nasa 's missions orbiting mars have revealed that the planet was once home to raging rivers -- and that those rivers existed more recently than previously thought , according to a new study . the rivers were two times wider than any on earth , according to the deep riverbeds they left carved into the surface , and they could be found at hundreds of locations across the planet . nasa 's photos showed well-preserved river channels , deltas and fan-shaped masses of material called alluvium that is carried and deposited by water . this week , a super-telescope peered into the atmosphere of an exoplanet , the world 's largest tyrannosaurus rex fossil was announced , and a global network of rivers was found on mars . the hubble telescope also spied an asteroid as it broke apart , and the all-female spacewalk did n't happen because of a spacesuit fail . here 's everything you missed this week in space and science . one stormy exoplanet for the first time , a super-telescope has revealed a complex atmosphere on an exoplanet , according to a new study . the company was not the first to recently announce that it would be changing the use of artificial flavors in its products . in 2015 , food giant , general mills proposed an initiative that noted that all of the artificial ingredients it was using in its products would be dropped by 2017 . this meant a reformulation of many of the cereals , with alternatives that were more suitable to the palates of humans . a key aspect in that proposed initiative was that the cereal , trix , would no longer have the blue and green colors forming a new iteration of the cereal .
the pentagon papers , officially titled report of the office of the secretary of defense vietnam task force , is a united states department of defense history of the united states ' political and military involvement in vietnam from 1945 to 1967 . the papers were released by daniel ellsberg , who had worked on the study ; they were first brought to the attention of the public on the front page of the new york times in 1971 . a 1996 article in the new york times said that the pentagon papers had demonstrated , among other things , that the johnson administration `` systematically lied , not only to the public but also to congress . '' ellsberg surrendered to authorities in boston , and admitted that he had given the papers to the press : `` i felt that as an american citizen , as a responsible citizen , i could no longer cooperate in concealing this information from the american public . i did this clearly at my own jeopardy and i am prepared to answer to all the consequences of this decision '' . he was indicted by a grand jury in los angeles on charges of stealing and holding secret documents . federal district judge william matthew byrne , jr. declared a mistrial and dismissed all charges against ellsberg and russo on may 11 , 1973 , after it was revealed that : agents acting on the orders of the nixon administration illegally broke into the office of ellsberg 's psychiatrist and attempted to steal files ; representatives of the nixon administration approached the ellsberg trial judge with an offer of the job of fbi directorship ; several irregularities appeared in the government 's case including its claim that it had lost records of illegal wiretapping against ellsberg conducted by the white house plumbers in the contemporaneous watergate scandal . the war on terror , also known as the global war on terrorism , is an international military campaign launched by the united states government after the september 11 attacks . the targets of the campaign are primarily sunni islamist fundamentalist armed groups located throughout the muslim world , with the most prominent groups being al-qaeda , the islamic state , the taliban , tehrik-i-taliban pakistan , and the various franchise groups of the former two organizations . the naming of the campaign uses a metaphor of war to refer to a variety of actions that do not constitute a specific war as traditionally defined . u.s. president george w. bush first used the term `` war on terrorism '' on 16 september 2001 , and then `` war on terror '' a few days later in a formal speech to congress .
although indiana is usually considered a republican stronghold , mourdock lost the general election to democratic nominee joe donnelly after the media attention over his comment in a debate that `` life is that gift from god that i think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape , that it is something that god intended to happen . '' dan parker , chairman of the indiana democratic party said , `` as a pro-life catholic , i 'm stunned and ashamed that richard mourdock believes god intended rape '' . he also said , `` victims of rape are victims of an extremely violent act , and mine is not a violent god . do we need any more proof that richard mourdock is an extremist who 's out of touch with hoosiers ? '' the day after the debate , mourdock issued a statement saying , `` god creates life , and that was my point . controversial comments about rape and abortion also came from other republican legislators and legislative candidates . following todd akin 's comments , reporters at the pennsylvania press club asked pennsylvania republican senate candidate tom smith on august 27 , 2012 , how , considering his no-exceptions anti-abortion stance , he would tell a daughter or granddaughter who had been raped that she must keep the pregnancy . smith said that he had been in a similar situation because his daughter had become pregnant out of wedlock . he said that he was not equating the two situations but that a father 's position was similar .
at the olympics , the dream team stayed at a luxury barcelona hotel instead of the olympic village due to security concerns . fans enthusiastically greeted the americans ; they gathered outside the hotel , hoping to see their favorite players . `` it was like elvis and the beatles put together , '' daly said . opposing basketball players and athletes from other sports often asked to have photographs taken with the players . global interest in basketball soared due to the dream team . in one game , an opposing player guarding magic johnson was seen frantically waving to a camera-wielding teammate on the bench , signaling to make sure he got a picture of them together . head coach chuck daly said of the opposing teams `` they 'll go home and for the rest of their lives be able to tell their kids , ` i played against michael jordan and magic johnson and larry bird . ' and the more they play against our best players , the more confident they 're going to get '' . the mcdonald 's all-american team is the best-known of the american high-school basketball all-american teams . designation as a mcdonald 's all-american instantly brands a player as one of the top high-school players in the united states or canada . selected athletes often go on to success in college basketball . every college team to win the ncaa men 's championship since 1978 has had at least one mcdonald 's all-american on its roster , except for the 2002 maryland terrapins and 2014 connecticut huskies .

janet tessier said that she made several fruitless attempts over the next fourteen years to get law enforcement , including the sycamore police and the fbi -lrb- who referred her back to the sycamore police -rrb- , to look into her mother 's statement . patrick solar , who during part of this time was a lieutenant with the sycamore police and had identified william henry redmond as the most likely suspect in the ridulph murder , told cnn that janet had never spoken to him , but that he would not have suspected john tessier -lrb- jack mccullough -rrb- because he knew the tessier family , ralph tessier had painted the sycamore police cars , and john tessier had been cleared by the fbi in 1957 . in 2008 , janet e-mailed an illinois state police tip line , resulting in the state police cold case unit undertaking a lengthy investigation into mccullough 's background and alibi . the defense argued that the prosecutors and police were pressured by the ridulph and tessier families to solve the case and implicate mccullough , although there was no physical evidence , motive , or indication that mccullough was in the area when maria was kidnapped . mccullough did not take the stand in his own defense on the advice of his attorneys . in july 2011 the seattle police department , which had joined with the illinois state police in the investigation , brought mccullough in for questioning -lrb- using a professional interrogator due to mccullough 's law enforcement experience -rrb- . at first , mccullough spoke calmly and cooperated , but when faced with questions about the murder of maria ridulph and his whereabouts on the night of the crime , he became evasive and aggressive . after mccullough refused to answer any more questions , he was arrested for the kidnapping and murder of maria ridulph and extradited to illinois .
the highest civilization and culture , apart from the ancient hindus and egyptians , are found exclusively among the white races ; and even with many dark peoples , the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has , therefore , evidently immigrated , for example , the brahmans , the incas , and the rulers of the south sea islands . all this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north , and there gradually became white , had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need , want and misery , which in their many forms were brought about by the climate . this they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization . still today the relationship between some ethnic groups and whiteness remains complex . in particular , some jewish and arab individuals both self-identify and are considered as part of the white american racial category , but others with the same ancestry feel they are not white nor are they perceived as white by american society . the united states census bureau proposed but then withdrew plans to add a new category to classify middle eastern and north african peoples in the u.s. census 2020 , over a dispute over whether this classification should be considered a white ethnicity or a race . according to frank sweet `` various sources agree that , on average , people with 12 percent or less admixture appear white to the average american and those with up to 25 percent look ambiguous -lrb- with a mediterranean skin tone -rrb- '' . former president barack obama on monday released a pointed statement condemning `` language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders '' that `` normalizes racist sentiments . '' the statement , which did not directly name president donald trump , follows two mass shootings in the us in the span of 13 hours -- one of which involved a white supremacist suspect . `` we should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments ; leaders who demonize those who do n't look like us , or suggest that other people , including immigrants , threaten our way of life , or refer to other people as sub-human , or imply that america belongs to just one certain type of people , '' obama said . `` it 's time for the overwhelming majority of americans of goodwill , of every race and faith and political party , to say as much -- clearly and unequivocally , '' he added .
two streaming services and one television network went home with oscar statuettes on sunday night . the historic wins for amazon , netflix and espn showcase the evolving and expanding shape of the movie business . netflix and amazon have been investing heavily in feature films and documentaries to retain and gain subscribers . with amazon ceo jeff bezos in the audience at the kodak theatre , the amazon studios film `` manchester by the sea '' picked up the oscar for best original screenplay , and the film 's star casey affleck won the lead actor prize . it was n't the best night for the oscars in terms of mistakes . in addition to what is now being referred to as `` envelopegate , '' in which `` la la land '' was mistakenly named best picture when `` moonlight '' actually won , the academy kind of killed off the wrong person . here 's what happened : during the `` in memoriam '' tribute to industry artists who died during the past year , the death of an australian costume designer janet patterson was noted . but the image that appeared in the video montage was of australian producer jan chapman . oscars host jimmy kimmel showered the audience with sweet treats , made a group of tourists ' hollywood dreams come true , and even tried to save the night following a historic blunder . but it was his ongoing faux-feud with matt damon that was truly worthy of gold sunday night . kimmel kicked off his night of damon torment with a nod to the actor -- who has long been a playful target of kimmel 's -- in his monologue . `` tonight in the spirit of bringing people together , i would like to bury the hatchet with someone i 've had issues with -- matt damon , '' he said .
the 2010 massachusetts senate special election victory of scott brown seriously imperiled the prospects of a health care reform bill , as democrats lost their 60-seat senate super-majority . the white house and speaker nancy pelosi engaged in an extensive campaign to convince both centrists and liberals in the house to pass the senate 's health care bill , the patient protection and affordable care act . in march 2010 , after obama announced an executive order reinforcing the current law against spending federal funds for elective abortion services , the house passed the patient protection and affordable care act . the bill , which had passed the senate in december 2009 , did not receive a single republican vote in either house . the affordable care act faced considerable challenges and opposition after its passage , and republicans continually attempted to repeal the law . the law also survived two major challenges that went to the supreme court . in national federation of independent business v. sebelius , a 5-4 majority upheld the constitutionality of the affordable care act , though it made state medicaid expansion voluntary . in king v. burwell , a 6-3 majority allowed the use of tax credits in state-operated exchanges . if you 're looking for a sign that this week is shaping up as a critical test of president barack obama 's presidency , look no further than his schedule on tuesday . in the morning , he 'll make his fifth address to the united nations general assembly -- this time , with major diplomatic opportunities emerging in syria and iran . later , his domestic agenda takes over when he turns again to former president bill clinton to explain obamacare a week ahead of a critical date in its implementation . obama 's health care law is the source of contention in washington , where republicans voted to defund it -- for the 42nd time -- in return for keeping the government running .

several al jazeera staff were killed by u.s. military `` friendly-fire '' incidents . the united-states-controlled iraqi interim government closed the offices of al jazeera in baghdad in august 2004 during the united states occupation on iraq . the interim iraqi prime minister iyad allawi then accused the channel of `` inciting hatred '' in the country . at the end of april 2013 , the iraqi government led by nouri al maliki once again ordered al jazeera to stop broadcasting due to the alleged role of the channel in `` encouraging the sectarian unrest '' . al jazeera came to the attention of many in the west during the hunt for osama bin laden and the taliban in afghanistan after the 11 september 2001 attacks on the united states . it aired videos it received from osama bin laden and the taliban , deeming new footage of the world 's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy . some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists . al jazeera 's washington , d.c. , bureau chief , hafez al-mirazi , compared the situation to that of the unabomber 's messages in the new york times . on 24 november 2017 dubai police deputy chief lieutenant general dhahi khalfan tamim accused al jazeera for provoking the 2017 sinai attack and called for bombing of al jazeera by the saudi-led coalition , tweeting in arabic `` the alliance must bomb the machine of terrorism ... the channel of isil , al-qaeda and the al-nusra front , al jazeera the terrorists '' .
in december 2012 , berlusconi announced on television that he would run again to become prime minister . berlusconi said his party 's platform would include opposition to monti 's economic performance , which he said put italy into a `` recessive spiral without end . '' he also told the media , on the sidelines of a.c. milan 's practice session -lrb- the football club he owns along with mediaset , the largest media outlet in the country -rrb- : `` i race to win . to win , everyone said there had to be a tested leader . under berlusconi , italy was an ally of israel . benjamin netanyahu said of berlusconi : `` we are lucky that there is a leader such as yourself . i do n't believe we have a better friend in the international community . '' berlusconi has been noted for his close and friendly relationship with israeli prime minister netanyahu . berlusconi remained prime minister for a little over a month until his replacement by a technocratic government headed by lamberto dini . dini had been a key minister in the berlusconi cabinet , and berlusconi said the only way he would support a technocratic government would be if dini headed it . in the end , however , dini was only supported by most opposition parties but not by forza italia . in 1996 , berlusconi and his coalition lost the elections and was replaced by a centre-left government led by romano prodi .
eight days later , on february 28 , 1969 , came the events for which kerry was awarded his silver star medal . on this occasion , kerry was in tactical command of his swift boat and two other swift boats during a combat operation . their mission on the duong keo river included bringing an underwater demolition team and dozens of south vietnamese marines to destroy enemy sampans , structures and bunkers as described in the story the death of pcf 43 . running into heavy small arms fire from the river banks , kerry `` directed the units to turn to the beach and charge the viet cong positions '' and he `` expertly directed '' his boat 's fire causing the enemy to flee while at the same time coordinating the insertion of the ninety south vietnamese troops -lrb- according to the original medal citation signed by admiral zumwalt -rrb- . after the south vietnamese troops and a team of three u.s. army advisors that were with them had disembarked at the ambush site , kerry 's boat and another headed up river to look for the fleeing enemy . the two boats came under fire from a viet cong b-40 rocket-propelled grenade , shattering the crew cabin windows of pcf-94 . kerry ordered the boats to turn and charge the second ambush site . as they reached the shore , a viet cong soldier jumped out of the brush , carrying a loaded b-40 launcher . britain 's first astronaut aboard the international space station is back on earth after a six-month mission . tim peake landed in a soyuz capsule in kazakhstan on saturday morning . he was accompanied by russian cosmonaut yuri malenchenko and u.s. astronaut timothy kopra , who 've spent 186 days in space with him . `` what an incredible journey it has been -- thank you for following ! ''
in 1989 , fleming expressed dissatisfaction with the daily syndicated jeopardy! series in an essay published in sports illustrated . he confessed that he only watched the trebek version infrequently , and then only for a handful of questions ; and also criticized this new iteration mainly for its hollywood setting . fleming believed that , in contrast to new yorkers who fleming considered to be more intelligent and authentic , moving the show to hollywood brought both an unrealistic glamour and a dumbing-down of the program that he disdained . my wife julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to new york city from duluth . i was mulling over game show ideas , when she noted that there had not been a successful ` question and answer ' game on the air since the quiz show scandals . why not do a switch , and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question ? she fired a couple of answers to me : `` 5,280 '' -- and the question of course was ` how many feet in a mile ? ' . griffin 's first conception of the game used a board comprising ten categories with ten clues each , but after finding that this board could not easily be shown on camera , he reduced it to two rounds of thirty clues each , with five clues in each of six categories . he originally intended the show to require grammatically correct phrasing -lrb- e.g. , only accepting `` who is ... '' for a person -rrb- , but after finding that grammatical correction slowed the game down , he decided that the show should instead accept any correct response that was in question form . griffin discarded his initial title for the show , what 's the question ? , when skeptical network executive ed vane rejected his original concept of the game , claiming , `` it does n't have enough jeopardies . ''
in june 2018 , the boston globe reported 467 current and former massachusetts department of transportation employees were using the e-zpass transponders for free . this employee benefit that has been going on since at least 2009 costs the massachusetts taxpayers approximately $ 1 million dollars per year . it is not clear if massdot has paid taxes on the benefit or reported it to the internal revenue service , or who would be responsible if a payment to the irs is required . president donald trump will look to reinvigorate his stalled push for a sweeping infrastructure bill tuesday when he meets with some of his top aides in new york to discuss the plan . trump 's attempts to pass an infrastructure reform plan have been largely left on the back burner on capitol hill , where issues like health care , tax reform and confirmations have taken precedence . trump , according to a white house official , will `` receive an update from his infrastructure team '' and sign an executive order that he hopes will `` bringing accountability and discipline '' into the process for permitting infrastructure projects . trump campaigned on a pledge to remake the way the federal government handles infrastructure projects , casting himself as a real estate developer who knows what it takes to get a building project done . the line 2 east extension project , is the currently under-construction eastward extension of line 2 , which adds 4-kilometer -lrb- 2.5 mi -rrb- of new line , starting from the eastern terminus of santolan station in marikinaup to masinag in antipolo . the project aims to accommodate an additional 80,000 passengers and reduce traffic congestion along marcos highway . when the project is completed , it will reduce travel time from recto to masinag from 3 hours to only 40 minutes . it is scheduled to be finished by 2019
david starr jordan , the first president of stanford university , posited four propositions to leland and jane stanford when accepting the post , the last of which stipulated , `` that provision be made for the publication of the results of any important research on the part of professors , or advanced students . such papers may be issued from time to time as ` memoirs of the leland stanford junior university . ''' in 1892 , the first work of scholarship to be published under the stanford name , the tariff controversy in the united states , 1789-1833 , by orrin leslie elliott , appeared with the designation `` no. 1 '' in the `` leland stanford junior university monographs series . '' that same year , student julius andrew quelle established a printing company on campus , publishing the student-run newspaper , the daily palo alto -lrb- now the stanford daily -rrb- and stanford faculty articles and books . the first use of the imprint `` stanford university press '' was in 1895 , with the story of the innumerable company , by president jordan . the band 's most infamous and controversial moment , however , had nothing to do with its irreverence . in the final four seconds of the 1982 big game against the university of california , berkeley -lrb- cal -rrb- , band members -lrb- as well as players from stanford -rrb- ran out onto the field , thinking the game was over after stanford players appeared to have tackled ball-carrier dwight garner . garner managed to lateral it to another player , and they continued to lateral back and forth , with cal 's kevin moen dodging through the band for a winning touchdown , which he ended by running over lsjumb trombone player gary tyrrell in the end zone . `` the play '' is celebrated by cal fans and inspires the ire of many stanford fans . stanford first offered a curriculum in legal studies in 1893 , when the university hired its first two law professors : former u.s. president benjamin harrison and nathan abbott . abbott headed the new program and assembled a small faculty over the next few years . the law department primarily enrolled undergraduate majors at this time and included a large number of students who might not have been welcome at more traditional law schools at the time , including women and students of color , especially hispanic , chinese and japanese students .
the dinah drake version of the character is the basis of the character donna nance , the black siren -lrb- voiced by jennifer hale -rrb- , in the justice league animated series episode `` legends '' -lrb- 2002 -rrb- . in september 2011 , the new 52 rebooted dc 's continuity . in this new timeline , dinah drake is black canary -lrb- she later marries kurt lance -rrb- . dinah founds the birds of prey and recruits the team , beginning with her friend ev crawford , known as starling . eventually katana and poison ivy join the team . following the universe-altering events of crisis on infinite earths -lrb- concluding in march 1986 -rrb- , black canary 's history was revised again . the mind-transplant story of 1983 was discarded ; in this version of the story , the present-day black canary is dinah laurel lance , who inherits the identity from her mother , dinah drake lance . although some references -lrb- for example , those in james robinson 's starman series -rrb- tried to distinguish the two canaries by calling the first `` diana '' , recent accounts have confirmed dinah as the mother 's given name .
stonehenge is a prehistoric monument in wiltshire , england , two miles -lrb- 3 km -rrb- west of amesbury . it consists of a ring of standing stones , each around 13 feet -lrb- 4.0 m -rrb- high , seven feet -lrb- 2.1 m -rrb- wide , and weighing around 25 tons . the stones are set within earthworks in the middle of the most dense complex of neolithic and bronze age monuments in england , including several hundred tumuli -lrb- burial mounds -rrb- . archaeologists believe it was constructed from 3000 bc to 2000 bc . the surrounding circular earth bank and ditch , which constitute the earliest phase of the monument , have been dated to about 3100 bc .
washington , d.c. , -lrb- -rrb- formally the district of columbia and commonly referred to as d.c. , washington , or the district , is the capital of the united states . founded after the american revolution as the seat of government of the newly independent country , washington was named after george washington , the first president of the united states and a founding father . as the seat of the united states federal government and several international organizations , washington is an important world political capital . the city , located on the potomac river bordering maryland and virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually.the signing of the residence act on july 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the potomac river on the country 's east coast . jason rezaian was welcomed back to the washington post newsroom with a standing ovation on wednesday . the visit was rezaian 's first time at the post since being freed from an iranian prison earlier this month . rezaian was detained by iran for almost a year and a half . he was released as part of a prisoner swap between the united states and iran . george washington university got rid of its sat requirement , and applications soared 28 % . this kind of jump is unprecedented , the school said . about 6,000 more students applied compared to the year before . it also saw a `` significant '' increase in applications from blacks , hispanics , international students and those who would be the first in their family to go to college .
in 2016 , it was reported he had recovered his voice after about three years of rehabilitation and therapy and could perform again . he attended his induction into the country music hall of fame on october 16 , 2016 , where he performed a rendition of `` amazing grace . '' in 2017 , it was noted that travis had suffered permanent damage , which disabled his right hand and has limited much of his speech and singing ability ; he continues to make public appearances but no longer sings , mainly because of apprehension about his ability to do it as well as he used to . he appeared on-stage with michael ray during a cover performance of `` forever and ever amen '' in june 2017 , to which travis contributed the final `` amen . '' in 1975 , while his brother was serving time in jail for a high-speed car chase , randy won a talent contest at a nightclub , country city usa , in charlotte , north carolina . the club 's owner , elizabeth `` lib '' hatcher , took an interest in the young singer , hired him as a cook , and gave him regular singing jobs at the club . during the late 1970s , randy worked and sang at country city usa . still in his late teens , travis had one more encounter with the law . travis and his brother , ricky , were encouraged to pursue their musical talents by their father , who was a fan of hank williams , george jones , and lefty frizzell . in 1967 , at the age of eight , randy began playing guitar and sang in his church of christ choir . two years later , he and his brother began performing at local clubs and talent contests , calling themselves the traywick brothers . although his father encouraged travis in his pursuit of music , the two often quarreled , which was a contributing factor in travis dropping out of high school ; he later became a juvenile delinquent and was arrested for various offenses , including auto theft and burglary .
in 2008 , it was announced that paramount pictures and plan b entertainment had acquired film rights to the books beautiful boy : a father 's journey through his son 's addiction , by david sheff , and tweak : growing up on methamphetamines , by his son nic sheff . both are about nic 's addiction and eventual recovery . the studio and producers were announcing that they would use the recently published books to frame a picture about drug addiction , from the perspective of both a young meth addict and the father who finds himself helpless to stop his son 's downward spiral . in 2011 , it was announced that writer and director cameron crowe had written a script based on the books . in his 2012 memoir my cross to bear , gregg allman confirms that several aspects of the movie are directly based on crowe 's time spent with the allman brothers band . the scene in which russell jumps from the top of the topeka party house into a pool was based on something duane allman did : `` the jumping off the roof into the pool , that was duane -- from the third floor of a place called the travelodge in san francisco . my brother wanted to do it again , but the cat who owned the place came out shaking his fist , yelling at him . we told that story all the time , and i have no doubt that cameron was around for it . '' in an interview with pearl jam on march 9 , 2009 , bassist jeff ament said '' ... our manager kelly has had the idea to do a 20-year anniversary retrospective movie so he 's been on board with cameron crowe for the last few years . '' the band 's guitarist mike mccready also stated in march , `` we are just in the very early stages of that , ...
it is unclear why nobel wished the peace prize to be administered in norway , which was ruled in union with sweden at the time of nobel 's death . the norwegian nobel committee speculates that nobel may have considered norway better suited to awarding the prize , as it did not have the same militaristic traditions as sweden . it also notes that at the end of the 19th century , the norwegian parliament had become closely involved in the inter-parliamentary union 's efforts to resolve conflicts through mediation and arbitration . during the occupation of norway , three members of the norwegian nobel committee fled into exile . the remaining members escaped persecution from the germans when the nobel foundation stated that the committee building in oslo was swedish property . thus it was a safe haven from the german military , which was not at war with sweden . these members kept the work of the committee going , but did not award any prizes . the highlight of the nobel prize award ceremony in stockholm occurs when each nobel laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of the king of sweden . in oslo , the chairman of the norwegian nobel committee presents the nobel peace prize in the presence of the king of norway . at first , king oscar ii did not approve of awarding grand prizes to foreigners . it is said that he changed his mind once his attention had been drawn to the publicity value of the prizes for sweden .

slaight communications inc v davidson , 1 s.c.r. 1038 is a leading decision of the supreme court of canada on the right to freedom of expression under section 2 -lrb- b -rrb- of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms and the charter 's relationship with administrative law . the court upheld an order given by the labour relations board that required an employer to give an employee a letter of recommendation containing information such as sales quotas , but could not divulge any further information regarding the employee 's performance . call was the son of the late edward payson call , once business manager of the journal of commerce , and a grandson of general francis x. marshall , a well-known indian fighter and one of the pioneers of colorado . he was also the son-in-law of new york state senator clarence lexow . in october 2019 , davidson accepted a public relations role for lobbying firm tulchan communications while retaining her job as an msp . her employment drew into question potential conflicts of interest and the size of her salary , £ 50,000 for 25 days ' work , in addition to her £ 63,000-a-year msp 's salary . a week later , she abandoned her taking up of the role after meeting with parliamentary officials , although she insisted no conflict would have emerged had she still taken up the role . prior to the 2019 uk general election davidson said that she would swim naked in loch ness if the scottish national party won 50 seats , but avoided the ordeal as the nationalists won only 48 .
from november 21 , 1945 until march 13 , 1946 -lrb- 113 days -rrb- , cio 's united automobile workers -lrb- uaw -rrb- , organized `` 320,000 hourly workers '' to form a us-wide strike against the general motors corporation , workers used the tactic of the sit down strike . it was `` the longest strike against a major manufacturer '' that the uaw had yet seen , and it was also `` the longest national gm strike in its history . '' as director of the uaw 's general motors department -lrb- coordinator of union relations with gm -rrb- , walter reuther suggested to his colleagues the idea of striking the gm manufacturing plants with a ` one-at-a-time ' strategy , which was `` intended to maximize pressure on the target company . '' reuther also put forth the demands of the strikers : a 30 percent increase in wages and a hold on product prices . the company manufactures most of its china market vehicles locally . shanghai gm , a joint venture with the chinese company saic motor , was created with canadian regal in 1990 on march 25 , 1997 . the shanghai gm plant was officially opened on december 15 , 1998 , when the first chinese-built buick came off the assembly line . the saic-gm-wuling automobile joint-venture is also successfully selling microvans under the wuling brand -lrb- 34 percent owned by gm -rrb- . general motors was the first company -lrb- in the modern era -rrb- to release an all-electric automobile . in 1990 , gm debuted the `` impact '' concept car at the los angeles auto show . it was the first car with zero-emissions marketed in the us in over three decades . the impact was eventually produced as the ev1 for the 1996 model year .
at the start of the 2000s , nbc 's fortunes started to take a rapid turn for the worse . that year , nbc 's longstanding ratings lead ended as cbs -lrb- which had languished in the ratings after losing the nfl -rrb- overtook it for first place . in 2001 , cbs chose to move its hit reality series survivor to serve as the anchor of its thursday night lineup . its success was taken as a suggestion that nbc 's nearly two decades of dominance on thursday nights could be broken ; even so , the strength of friends , will & grace , er and just shoot me ! in december 2005 , nbc began its first week-long primetime game show event , deal or no deal ; the series garnered high ratings , and returning as a weekly series in march 2006 . otherwise , the 2005 -- 06 season was one of the worst for nbc in three decades , with only one fall series , the sitcom my name is earl , surviving for a second season ; the sole remaining anchor of the `` must see tv '' lineup , will & grace also saw its ratings decline . that season , nbc 's ratings fell to fourth place , behind a resurgent abc , fox -lrb- which would eventually become the most-watched u.s. broadcast network in the 2007 -- 08 season -rrb- and top-rated cbs -lrb- which led for much of the remainder of the decade -rrb- . during this time , all of the networks faced audience erosion from increased competition by cable television , home video , video games and the internet , with nbc being the hardest hit . in 1974 , under new president herb schlosser , the network tried to attract younger viewers with a series of costly movies , miniseries and specials . this failed to attract the desirable 18 -- 34 demographic , and simultaneously alienated older viewers . none of the new prime-time shows that nbc introduced in the fall of 1975 earned a second season renewal , all failing in the face of established competition . the network 's lone breakout success that season was the groundbreaking late-night comedy/variety show , nbc 's saturday night -- which would be renamed saturday night live in 1976 , after the cancellation of a howard cosell-hosted program of the same title on abc -- which replaced reruns of the tonight show that previously aired in its saturday time slot .
lobsters are omnivores and typically eat live prey such as fish , mollusks , other crustaceans , worms , and some plant life . they scavenge if necessary , and are known to resort to cannibalism in captivity . however , when lobster skin is found in lobster stomachs , this is not necessarily evidence of cannibalism -- lobsters eat their shed skin after moulting . while cannibalism was thought to be nonexistent among wild lobster populations , it was observed in 2012 by researchers studying wild lobsters in maine . the california spiny lobster is found in parts of the gulf of california , and along the pacific coast of the length of the baja california peninsula , extending as far north as san luis obispo bay , california . there are occasional records from monterey bay , but the water there is too cold for the california spiny lobster to breed , and it is thought that any adult found in central california arrived as a larva during el niño years . the normal coloration of homarus americanus is redder on the body and claws , and greener on the legs . this coloration is produced by mixing yellow , blue , and red pigments that occur naturally in the shell . despite the rarity of strangely colored lobsters , many more of them are reported being caught . it is unclear as to whether this is an artifact of social media making reporting and sharing more accessible , or if it is due to a drop in predator populations .
trump said in july 2016 that his father , donald trump , had made `` hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal donations '' to the eric trump foundation in the past , although the eric trump foundation 's tax records do n't explicitly show such donations . when the washington post followed up for evidence , trump appeared to backtrack and refused to give details . eric trump , in the forbes article , discussed the `` clear separation of church and state that we maintain '' between the business and his father and said that with his father 's presidency and related changes `` ou could look at it either way '' in terms of business prospects . he also said that `` he will continue to update his father on the business while he is in the presidency ... ` probably quarterly ... profitability reports and stuff like that ' . '' the article quoted larry noble , general counsel of the nonpartisan campaign legal center and a former chief ethics officer at the federal election commission , and president george w. bush 's former chief ethics lawyer , richard painter , as looking negatively at such multiple planned updates of president trump per year . noble said in part `` if he is now going to get reports from his son about the businesses , then he really is n't separate in any real way . '' on august 2 , 2016 , in a television appearance on cbs this morning , trump was asked to comment on his father 's controversial statement to usa today the previous day in which he said that if his daughter were ever subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace , he hoped she would find another company to work for or switch careers . eric trump said , `` ivanka is a strong , powerful woman ; she would n't allow herself to be objected to it . ''
the bill was introduced in the senate by senator wayne allard -lrb- r-colo . -rrb- on november 25 , 2003 , and designated s.j.res .26 . the amendment changed the language of the proposed amendment , substituting `` marriage '' for `` marital status '' and specifying that it applied to `` any union other than the union of a man and a woman '' rather than `` unmarried couples or groups '' . the changes were intended to make it clear that state legislatures could still recognize civil unions if the amendment were to pass . `` this new language makes the intent of the legislation even clearer : to protect marriage in this country as the union between a man and a woman , and to reinforce the authority of state legislatures to determine benefits issues related to civil unions or domestic partnerships , '' said sen. wayne allard . in an april 2006 article , time named allard as one of america 's 5 worst senators , dubbing him `` the invisible man '' . the article criticised him for being `` so bland that his critics have dubbed him `` dullard '' '' , for `` never playing a role in major legislation , even though he 's on two key senate committees , budget and appropriations '' and for `` rarely speaking on the floor or holding press conferences to push his ideas '' , concluding that `` few of the bills he has introduced over the past year have passed '' . the article did however note that he was `` polite , affable and willing to take on thankless tasks , such as his current role overseeing the construction of a visitors center on capitol hill '' . in response , two major colorado newspapers defended the senator . the fma 's republican co-sponsors , senator wayne allard -lrb- r-co -rrb- and representative marilyn musgrave -lrb- r-co -rrb- , announced new language for the proposed amendment on march 23 , 2004 , replacing the second sentence of the amendment with `` neither this constitution , nor the constitution of any state , shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman .

the usda also is concerned with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both the domestic and world markets . it plays a role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries . this aid can go through usaid , foreign governments , international bodies such as world food program , or approved nonprofits . the agricultural act of 1949 , section 416 -lrb- b -rrb- and agricultural trade development and assistance act of 1954 , also known as food for peace , provides the legal basis of such actions . during the great depression , farming remained a common way of life for millions of americans . the department of agriculture 's bureau of home economics , established in 1923 , published shopping advice and recipes to stretch family budgets and make food go farther . usda helped ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it , assisted with loans for small landowners , and contributed to the education of the rural youth . the united states department of agriculture -lrb- usda -rrb- , also known as the agriculture department , is the u.s. federal executive department responsible for developing and executing federal laws related to farming , forestry , rural economic development , and food . it aims to meet the needs of farmers and ranchers , promotes agricultural trade and production , works to assure food safety , protects natural resources , fosters rural communities and works to end hunger in the united states and internationally . approximately 80 % of the usda 's $ 141 billion budget goes to the food and nutrition service -lrb- fns -rrb- program . the largest component of the fns budget is the supplemental nutrition assistance program -lrb- formerly known as the food stamp program -rrb- , which is the cornerstone of usda 's nutrition assistance.the current secretary of agriculture is sonny perdue .
jews -lrb- hebrew : יְהוּדִים iso 259-2 yehudim , israeli pronunciation -rrb- or jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and a nation , originating from the israelites and hebrews of historical israel and judah . jewish ethnicity , nationhood , and religion are strongly interrelated , as judaism is the ethnic religion of the jewish people , while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance.jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the middle east during the second millennium bce , in the part of the levant known as the land of israel . the merneptah stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of israel somewhere in canaan as far back as the 13th century bce -lrb- late bronze age -rrb- . the israelites , as an outgrowth of the canaanite population , consolidated their hold with the emergence of the kingdoms of israel and judah . hindus -lrb- hindustani : -lrb- listen -rrb- -rrb- are persons who regard themselves as culturally , ethnically , or religiously adhering to aspects of hinduism . historically , the term has also been used as a geographical , cultural , and later religious identifier for people living in the indian subcontinent.the historical meaning of the term hindu has evolved with time . starting with the persian and greek references to the land of the indus in the 1st millennium bce through the texts of the medieval era , the term hindu implied a geographic , ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the indian subcontinent around or beyond the sindhu -lrb- indus -rrb- river . by the 16th century , the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not turkic or muslims.the historical development of hindu self-identity within the local south asian population , in a religious or cultural sense , is unclear . muslims are people who follow or practice islam , a monotheistic abrahamic religion . muslims consider the quran , their holy book , to be the verbatim word of god as revealed to the islamic prophet and messenger muhammad . the majority of muslims also follow the teachings and practices of muhammad -lrb- sunnah -rrb- as recorded in traditional accounts -lrb- hadith -rrb- . `` muslim '' is an arabic word meaning `` submitter '' -lrb- to god -rrb- . the beliefs of muslims include : that god -lrb- arabic : الله allāh -rrb- is eternal , transcendent and absolutely one -lrb- tawhid -rrb- ; that god is incomparable , self-sustaining and neither begets nor was begotten ; that islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that has been revealed before through many prophets including abraham , ishmael , isaac , moses , and jesus ; that these previous messages and revelations have been partially changed or corrupted over time -lrb- tahrif -rrb- and that the quran is the final unaltered revelation from god -lrb- final testament -rrb- .
early modern europe is the period of european history between the end of the middle ages and the beginning of the industrial revolution , roughly the late 15th century to the late 18th century . historians variously mark the beginning of the early modern period with the invention of moveable type printing in the 1450s , the fall of constantinople in 1453 , the end of the wars of the roses in 1487 , the beginning of the high renaissance in italy in the 1490s , the end of the reconquista and subsequent voyages of christopher columbus to the americas in 1492 , or the start of the protestant reformation in 1517 . the precise dates of its end point also vary and are usually linked with either the start of the french revolution in 1789 or with the more vaguely defined beginning of the industrial revolution in late 18th century england . some of the more notable trends and events of the early modern period included the reformation and the religious conflicts it provoked -lrb- including the french wars of religion and the thirty years ' war -rrb- , the rise of capitalism and modern nation states , widespread witch hunts and european colonization of the americas . early christianity is a period in the history of christianity , generally reckoned by church historians to begin with the ministry of jesus -lrb- c. 27-30 -rrb- and end with the first council of nicaea -lrb- 325 -rrb- . it is typically divided into two periods : christianity in the 1st century which is known as the apostolic age -lrb- c. 30 -- 100 -rrb- and the ante-nicene period -lrb- c. 100 -- 325 -rrb- . christians in the roman empire were persecuted until emperor constantine i 's toleration and promotion of christianity . the earliest followers of jesus were an apocalyptic , second temple jewish sect of jewish christians in the roman province of judea . early county is a county located on the southwest border of the u.s. state of georgia . as of the 2010 census , the population was 11,008 . the county seat is blakely , where the early county courthouse is located . created on december 15 , 1818 , it was named for peter early , 28th governor of georgia .
democratic superdelegates are free to support any candidate for the presidential nomination . this contrasts with pledged delegates who are selected based on the party primaries and caucuses in each u.s. state , in which voters choose among candidates for the party 's presidential nomination . on august 25 , 2018 , the democratic national committee agreed to reduce the influence of superdelegates by generally preventing them from voting on the first ballot at the democratic national convention , allowing their votes only in a contested nomination . in december 2018 , the democratic national committee -lrb- dnc -rrb- announced the preliminary schedule for 12 official dnc-sanctioned debates , set to begin in june 2019 , with six debates in 2019 and the remaining six during the first four months of 2020 . candidates are allowed to participate in forums featuring multiple other candidates as long as only one candidate appears on stage at a time ; if candidates participate in any unsanctioned debate with other presidential candidates , they will lose their invitation to the next dnc-sanctioned debate . some democratic presidential candidates are not happy with the democratic national committee , and their anger is no longer being kept private . at least three candidates and their closest advisers are publicly criticizing the committee , with some lambasting it for limiting space in the first two debates -- which require candidates to meet donor or polling thresholds -- and others refusing to focus a debate on climate change . the uptick in criticism for the dnc brings to light conversations that have to date largely happened behind the scenes . but with the first democratic primary debate in three weeks and the prospect that at least one current democratic office holder could not make the debate stage , campaigns are starting to go public with their complaints against the dnc and their debate rules .

matthew 's account describes jesus with a broader greek word παιδίον -lrb- paidion -rrb- , which can mean either `` infant '' or `` child '' , rather than the more specific word for infant βρέφος -lrb- bréphos -rrb- , possibly implying that some time has passed since the birth . however , the word παιδίον -lrb- paidíon -rrb- is also used in luke 's gospel specifically concerning jesus ' birth and his presentation at the temple . herod i has all male hebrew babies up to age two in the area killed in the massacre of the innocents . episode notes : all the contestants competing were female chefs . chef saylor cut herself , but did not bandage her finger because she did n't notice any blood until it was too late . the judges found blood on her plates and did not taste her dish . while he loves to work and enjoys being the butler bulldog , it 's time . the average lifespan of an english bulldog is 8-to-12 years , and now that trip is entering that range , we want to make sure he gets to enjoy the simple pleasures of life as just our family dog .
dr. william tietz , msu 's ninth president , arrived in august 1977 just as economic conditions in the state were improving . with three of the four vice presidencies at the university open , tietz imposed his stamp on the administration almost immediately . this included a strong emphasis on research , faculty development , better teaching , and diversity -lrb- particularly for native americans , the handicapped , and women -rrb- . his aggressiveness , energy , and immediate rebudgeting of funds into faculty sabbaticals helped win over professors , who voted against unionization in 1978 . in february 1964 , dr. leon h. johnson was appointed president of msc . a research chemist who joined the college in 1943 , he had most recently been the executive director of school 's endowed and research foundation -lrb- at the time , msc 's largest research unit -rrb- and dean of the graduate division . deeply committed to the college 's research function , he pushed for msc to be named a university -- a change renne had since the early 1950s , and which the montana state legislature approved on july 1 , 1965 . at that time , the school received its new name , montana state university -lrb- msu -rrb- . montana state university refers to itself as `` the university of the yellowstone , '' for its extensive research and scholarly activities concerning the greater yellowstone ecosystem . montana state university has received more than five times the number of national science foundation grants for yellowstone studies than its nearest competition , stanford and ucla , according to david roberts , head of msu 's ecology department .

david pecker , ceo of hachette filipacchi magazines who were partners in george , said the decline was because kennedy refused to `` take risks as an editor , despite the fact that he was an extraordinary risk taker in other areas of his life . '' pecker said , `` he understood that the target audience for george was the eighteen-to-thirty-four-year-old demographic , yet he would routinely turn down interviews that would appeal to this age group , like princess diana or john gotti jr. , to interview subjects like dan rostenkowski or võ nguyên giáp . '' shortly before his death , kennedy had been planning a series of online chats with the 2000 presidential candidates . microsoft was to provide the technology and pay for it while receiving advertising in george . the next day , kennedy 's cousin patrick revealed that the pair had married . when they returned to their manhattan home , a mass of reporters was on the doorstep . one of them asked kennedy if he had enjoyed his honeymoon , to which he responded : `` very much . '' he added `` getting married is a big adjustment for us , and for a private citizen like carolyn even more so . king said that his father regularly whipped him until he was 15 ; a neighbor reported hearing the elder king telling his son `` he would make something of him even if he had to beat him to death . '' king saw his father 's proud and fearless protests against segregation , such as king sr. refusing to listen to a traffic policeman after being referred to as `` boy , '' or stalking out of a store with his son when being told by a shoe clerk that they would have to `` move to the rear '' of the store to be served .
republican national committee chairman reince priebus gave voice wednesday to the mistrust between his party and president barack obama after the president said he was `` not going to just wait '' on republicans to pass comprehensive immigration reform . `` i do n't believe a thing he says , '' priebus said wednesday , when asked by cnn 's erin burnett about working with the president . `` all he 's been doing for the last year is lying to hispanic voters across the country . '' while both parties said wednesday that they hoped to find common ground , they also signaled imminent conflict . house majority leader kevin mccarthy tied his party 's 2016 white house prospects to the election just one week away -- and how republicans govern over the next two years . speaking at a fundraiser in long island this weekend , the no. 2 house republican told donors that republicans need to win back the senate this year and govern effectively in congress beginning in january to have a chance at seating a republican in the oval office . `` if we do n't capture the house stronger , and the senate , and prove we could govern , there wo n't be a republican president in 2016 , '' mccarthy said , according to a politico profile published sunday . president barack obama is n't ceding ground on his most controversial policies despite an election that delivered a stinging rebuke to him and his party on capitol hill . during a roughly 90-minute press conference wednesday , obama gave no sign that he 'd accept major revisions to his signature health care law , change his mind on bypassing congress on immigration or consent to republican demands on energy and the environment . indeed , the president did n't do much to suggest that his white house would work differently after republicans won at least 52 seats in the senate and their biggest majority in the house since world war ii . while obama made clear he had no desire to reshape his agenda , he did acknowledge that voters dealt his party a dramatic defeat on tuesday .
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has a decision to make . in the wake of two mass shootings in texas and ohio that left 31 people dead , the senate 's leading republican -- a 35-year public servant who has earned a reputation as being hardened to the criticisms of democrats and who relishes stopping house legislation at the senate 's edge -- is grappling with how his party can respond to a changing moment in american politics on guns . not just in washington , but back home in kentucky , mcconnell is facing the kind of pressure that were it on any other member , might shift momentum even incrementally . at a vigil outside his office tuesday night , more than 100 protesters gathered . since two more mass shootings left more than two dozen people dead in el paso , texas and dayton , ohio this past weekend , americans -- from left , right and center -- have been amplifying their demands that someone do something , anything , to end america 's long national nightmare of gun violence . like , perhaps , bring two bipartisan laws for background checks regulating gun sales -- which have already passed the house of representatives -- to the senate floor . but that 's not happening , thanks in large part to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell . mcconnell may have been elected to represent the state of kentucky , but he works hard to make sure that no one in congress can get anything done unless he judges it politically expedient . democratic presidential candidate kamala harris said monday that congressional action on gun control sits `` literally in the hands '' of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell after two mass shootings in the us have left at least 31 dead . `` this is , actually , literally in the hands of one person in terms of this legislative action , and it 's mitch mcconnell , '' harris told cnn 's wolf blitzer on `` the situation room . '' `` and i would hope and pray that he understands that he actually has the power to do the right thing here and that he will do the right thing . but it does n't sound like he 's prepared to do that .

blaine had briefly joined the cheerios when it looked like new directions would be disbanding after their sectionals loss , and cheerleading coach sue -lrb- jane lynch -rrb- blackmails blaine into rejoining ; blaine and sam hatch up a plan to bring sue down from the inside . blaine eventually confesses to sam that he has feelings for him , to which sam assures him that he is somewhat flattered by blaine 's honesty and attraction , and that it would not change the fact that blaine is still sam 's best friend . blaine still loves kurt and asks burt for his permission to propose to kurt , but burt tells him they 're too young to marry , and advises him to wait . blaine remains determined , however , and while shopping for a ring , he meets jan -lrb- patty duke -rrb- , a lesbian jeweler who has been with her partner liz -lrb- meredith baxter -rrb- for over thirty years . blaine and kurt 's relationship has been generally well received . they were named favorite tv couple at the 2010 afterelton.com visibility awards , and have been lauded for `` leading the way '' in representing gay teenagers on television by entertainment weekly . jarett wieselman of the new york post referred to them as `` one of the most beloved tv couples of the millennium '' . when they `` finally solidified what their relationship actually is '' in the episode `` silly love songs '' , ign 's robert canning noted that his opinion of blaine improved . upon blaine 's first appearance , criss described his character as being a `` very charismatic , put-together , composed guy . '' he stated that although blaine is gay , he is not `` overly queeny , and not too butch either , '' and that while his sexuality is a `` huge part of who he is '' , it is not a major facet of how he wishes to be perceived . due to similarities which stem from their shared sexuality , blaine `` sees a lot of himself in kurt , in terms of experiences and the way they feel about the world around them . he feels the need to impart his knowledge , be a source of strength for him , and really help him through what he 's going through .

'' following his death , the new york times described gaye as someone who `` blended the soul music of the urban scene with the beat of the old-time gospel singer and became an influential force in pop music '' . further in the article , gaye was also credited with combining `` the soulful directness of gospel music , the sweetness of soft-soul and pop , and the vocal musicianship of a jazz singer .

'' in 2010 , parton said she became involved with the operation because she `` always thought that if i made it big or got successful at what i had started out to do , that i wanted to come back to my part of the country and do something great , something that would bring a lot of jobs into this area .

on thursday night , the five remaining republican presidential candidates faced off at the cnn debate in texas -- the final debate before super tuesday . as always , what was spoken was important , but body language really said it all . the ultimate republican power couple -- former president george h.w. bush and his wife barbara -- made a cameo . haunted by his famous last name and perpetually stuck in the shadows of his anti-establishment rivals , jeb bush repeatedly confronted rejection by voters and frustrating setbacks throughout the 2016 presidential race . in south carolina saturday night bush suspended his white house campaign and acknowledged a painful reality : the country was not interested in a third president bush . bush 's disappointing finish in the palmetto state became the final straw for his floundering campaign . the end was all the more personal because the former florida governor had poured his energy into the state , invoking his family 's political legacy at one campaign stop after another and facing down voters who questioned his campaign strategy . jeb bush always remained optimistic . from the beginning of his candidacy last june , he pledged to run with `` joy '' and adopted a tortoise-and-the-hare strategy , earnestly believing that he would prevail in the end despite a crowded field of candidates . read : jeb bush suspends his campaign even as his chances became grim over the past eight months , he started handing out tiny toy turtles from his pockets to children , telling them that `` slow and steady wins the race .

in 2012 , the third circuit court of appeals enforced a subpoena seeking production of documents by kronos , inc. , in an administrative charge before the eeoc alleging disability discrimination . the charge was brought by an individual job applicant against kroger food co. , who did not hire the job applicant and used a kronos assessment as part of its hiring process . kronos , which was not a party to the litigation , objected to the eeoc 's subpoena on the basis that the information requested was irrelevant , and production would require kronos to disclose protected trade secret information . having thus determined the vampire 's weakness , kronos and grost obtain an iron cross from a cemetery . they are accosted by angry villagers , who believe that they murdered dr. marcus . grost forges the cross into a sword , while kronos conducts a knightly vigil . after seeing the durward carriage flee the scene of a vampire attack , kronos suspects sara as the vampire . when his village is plagued by mysterious deaths marked by highly accelerated aging , dr. marcus calls in his army friend , captain kronos . kronos and his companion , the hunchback hieronymus grost , are professional vampire hunters . grost explains to the initially skeptical marcus that the dead women are victims of a vampire who drains not blood but youth , and that there are `` as many species of vampire as there are beasts of prey '' . the discovery of another victim confirms grost 's explanation .
tom steyer 's strategy did not appear to pay off . the billionaire hedge-fund founder plowed millions of dollars into television and social media ads to promote his bid for the democratic presidential nomination , but he failed to register a minimum of 2 percentage points in two polls released wednesday morning . without those polls , he is likely to miss the debate stage in houston next month . steyer entered the race late -- on july 9 -- and scrambled to meet the democratic national committee 's polling and donor benchmarks . with the deadline fast approaching to qualify for the september debate stage , a handful of democratic presidential candidates is on a spending spree to find donors and supporters who can help them meet the debate requirements . the stakes are high for lower-tier candidates , hoping to improve their political fortunes with a breakout moment in a nationally televised debate . but they face barriers to entry : they must attract 130,000 unique donors and register at least 2 % support in four polls endorsed by the democratic national committee . california billionaire tom steyer , who recently announced he had met the 130,000-donor threshold , still had not met the polling requirement for the september debate as of thursday morning . more than $ 15 million . that 's what tom steyer has spent on television and digital advertising in less than two months as he has raced to make a name for himself as a democratic presidential contender . but on thursday , the results were clear . despite filling the television airwaves and the facebook feeds of voters in early voting states such as iowa , new hampshire and south carolina , the billionaire hedge-fund founder had not cleared the last remaining obstacle to join next month 's nationally televised debates : earning at least 2 % support in four polls sanctioned by the democratic national committee .

'' keegan was suspended for 8 weeks and in those 8 weeks keegan and the squad made efforts to integrate . keegan knew the dressing room was turning , when he was getting invited to the squad nights out , when one player told him he could get cheap meat for his dogs and when the full back peter hidien even got a perm . an unhappy first few months at the club gave way to a more successful season . although the club finished tenth in the league in 1977 -- 78 , keegan 's 12 goals helped him pick up a personal honour , the france football european footballer of the year award for 1978 . since completing the purchase of the club , ashley has announced that he planned to sell the club on three different occasions . the first occurred after fan protests over the resignation of kevin keegan on 14 september 2008 , when ashley stated , `` i have listened to you . you want me out . that is what i am now trying to do .

`` more than a few times , i 've had to pick myself up and get back in the game . '' it was a single line from hillary clinton 's speech to the democratic national convention on thursday night . but it was one of the most authentic and relatable parts of that speech . that line , and the reality of how hard women have to fight just to be who and what they want to be , resonated deeply with me as i remembered the experiences of the most important people in my life . first lady michelle obama gave the final speech of the evening , stating that `` barack knows what it means when a family struggles ... he knows what it means to want something more for your kids and grandkids . barack knows the american dream because he 's lived it , and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity , no matter who we are , or where we 're from , or what we look like , or who we love . '' her speech lasted 25 minutes and focused on the barack obama she fell in love with as well as the strength of the american spirit and those in the military . `` i 've seen it in our men and women in uniform and our proud military families ... in a young man blinded by a bomb in afghanistan who said simply , ` i 'd give my eyes 100 times again to have the chance to do what i have done , and what i can still do . '' as hillary clinton playfully batted away an avalanche of balloons thursday night , she appeared proud , happy and reconciled to her historic moment . she had accepted the democratic nomination with `` humility , determination and boundless confidence in america 's promise , '' taking her place as the first woman to lead a major presidential ticket on a night pulsating with emotion . `` when there are no ceilings , '' she declared , `` the sky 's the limit . '' her speech lacked the poetic sweep of the president barack obama 's address wednesday , but it was in keeping with someone who presents herself as a practical , dogged , policy-oriented striver who gets knocked down and then gets straight back up .

'' benjamin franklin 's observation has been confirmed by recent studies in self-deception . in everyday reasoning , humans do little to get real evidence when taking positions or making decisions , and do even less to get evidence for opposing positions . instead , they tend to fabricate `` pseudo-evidence '' -- often after the decision had already been made -lrb- `` post hoc fabrication '' -rrb- . cleary became interested in buddhism when he was a teenager ; his researches into buddhist thought began with a desire to learn during this time of his life . when he began translating , he chose either untranslated works or -- as in the case of sun tzu 's the art of war -- books whose extant translations were `` too limited '' . cleary earned a ph.d in east asian languages and civilizations from harvard university , and a jd from the boalt hall school of law at the university of california , berkeley . since completing his doctoral studies , cleary has had little involvement with the academic world . niccolò machiavelli noted that `` the mass of mankind accept what seems as what is ; nay , are often touched more nearly by appearances than by realities '' . natural selection works by the principle of survival of the fittest , and several researchers have shown that humans evolved to play the game of life in a machiavellian way . the best way to cultivate a reputation for fairness is to really be fair . but since it is much harder to be fair than to seem fair , and since laziness is built deep into human nature , humans more often choose appearance over reality .
japan -lrb- japanese : 日本 , nippon -lrb- listen -rrb- or nihon -lrb- listen -rrb- -rrb- is an island country located in east asia . it is bordered by the sea of japan to the west and the pacific ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,900 mi -rrb- along the coast of the continent from the sea of okhotsk in the north to the east china sea and philippine sea in the south . part of the pacific ring of fire , japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands -lrb- hokkaido , honshu , kyushu , shikoku , and okinawa -rrb- comprising 97 % of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers -lrb- 145,937 sq mi -rrb- . japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . japanese people -lrb- japanese : 日本人 , hepburn : nihonjin -rrb- are an ethnic group that is native to the japanese archipelago and modern country of japan , where they constitute 98.5 % of the total population . worldwide , approximately 129 million people are of japanese descent ; of these , approximately 125 million are residents of japan . people of japanese ancestry who live outside japan are referred to as nikkeijin -lrb- 日系人 -rrb- , the japanese diaspora . the term ethnic japanese is used to refer to mainland japanese people , specifically the yamato . the japanese diaspora , and its individual members known as nikkei -lrb- 日系 -rrb- or nikkeijin -lrb- 日系人 -rrb- , are the japanese immigrants from japan and their descendants that reside in a foreign country . emigration from japan was recorded as early as the 12th century to the philippines , but did not become a mass phenomenon until the meiji period , when japanese began to go to the philippines and the americas . there was also significant emigration to the territories of the empire of japan during the colonial period ; however , most emigrants repatriated to japan after the surrender of japan and the end of world war ii in asia.according to the association of nikkei and japanese abroad , there are about 3.8 million nikkei living in their adopted countries . the largest of these foreign communities are in brazil , the united states , the philippines , china , canada , and peru .
native americans , also known as american indians , indigenous americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the united states , except hawaii and territories of the united states . more than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the us , about half of which are associated with indian reservations . the term `` american indian '' excludes native hawaiians and some alaskan natives , while `` native americans '' -lrb- as defined by the us census -rrb- are american indians , plus alaska natives of all ethnicities . the us census does not include native hawaiians or chamorro , instead being included in the census grouping of `` native hawaiian and other pacific islander '' . american ancestry refers to people in the united states who self-identify their ancestral origin or descent as `` american '' , rather than the more common officially recognized racial and ethnic groups that make up the bulk of the american people . the majority of these respondents are visibly white americans , who either simply use this response as a political statement or no longer self-identify with their original ethnic ancestral origins . the latter response is attributed to a multitude of or generational distance from ancestral lineages , and these tend be of english , scotch-irish , or other british ancestries , as demographers have observed that those ancestries tend to be seriously undercounted in u.s. census bureau american community survey ancestry self-reporting estimates . although u.s. census data indicates `` american ancestry '' is commonly self-reported in the deep south and upland south , the vast majority of americans and expatriates do not equate their nationality with ancestry , race or ethnicity , but with citizenship and allegiance . the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical , geographical , and political context in which it is used . american is derived from america , a term originally denoting all of the new world -lrb- also called the americas -rrb- . in some expressions , it retains this pan-american sense , but its usage has evolved over time and , for various historical reasons , the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america . in modern english , american generally refers to persons or things related to the united states of america ; among native english speakers this usage is almost universal , with any other use of the term requiring specification .
the tisch college was founded in 2000 `` to educate for active citizenship '' with the help of a $ 10 million gift from ebay founder pierre omidyar and his wife pam . the school was renamed in 2006 after a $ 40 million gift from jonathan tisch . it has been called the `` most ambitious attempt by any research university to make public service part of its core academic mission '' . the college facilitates and supports a wide range of community service , civic engagement programs , research , and teaching initiatives across the university . in 2006 , dean of arts and sciences robert sternberg added experimental criteria to the application process for undergraduates to test `` creativity and other non-academic factors '' , including inviting applicants to submit youtube videos to supplement their application . calling it the `` first major university to try such a departure from the norm '' , inside higher ed also notes that tufts continues to consider the sat and other traditional criteria . in the 1840s , the universalist church wanted to open a college in new england , and charles tufts donated 20 acres to the church in 1852 to help them achieve this goal . charles tufts had inherited the land , a barren hill which was one of the highest points in the boston area , called walnut hill , and when asked by a family member what he intended to do with the land , he said `` i will put a light on it . '' his 20-acre donation -lrb- then valued at $ 20,000 -rrb- is still at the heart of tufts ' now-150 acre campus , straddling somerville and medford . it was also in 1852 that the commonwealth of massachusetts chartered tufts college , noting the college should promote `` virtue and piety and learning in such of the languages and liberal and useful arts as shall be recommended .

columbia university received 40,203 applications for the class of 2022 -lrb- entering 2018 -rrb- and a total of 2,214 were admitted to the two schools for an overall acceptance rate of 5.5 % , making columbia the third most selective college in the united states behind stanford and harvard as well as the second most selective college in the ivy league . according to the 2012 college selectivity ranking by u.s. news & world report , which factors admission and yield rates among other criteria , columbia was tied with yale , caltech and mit as the most selective colleges in the country . columbia is a racially diverse school , with approximately 52 % of all students identifying themselves as persons of color . additionally , 50 % of all undergraduates received grants from columbia . last monday the white house commission examining the nation 's opioid epidemic , headed by new jersey gov. chris christie , released its interim report that says president donald trump should declare an emergency because `` our citizens are dying . '' the recommendation that trump declare a national public health emergency over the growing opioid crisis is long overdue and a welcome relief , according to medical professionals and those battling the epidemic on the front lines . but some worry the administration may not follow through on campaign promises to address the opioid crisis , and they express concern that the recent evidence-based treatment recommendations are at odds with the justice department 's new war on drugs . you 've probably been told many , many times before that money ca n't buy you happiness -lrb- or love , for that matter -rrb- . but a new study is challenging that notion . researchers at the university of british columbia and harvard business school surveyed more than 6,000 adults in the u.s. , canada , and europe , and asked how much money they spend regularly to gain more free time . the results ?
lockett 's failed execution occurred at oklahoma state penitentiary in mcalester , oklahoma , on april 29 , 2014 , after he had been tasered by staff and attempted to cut himself earlier that day . a paramedic tried twice to put an iv needle into lockett 's left arm but failed . she then tried to insert the needle into his brachial vein in his biceps but also failed . she asked for help from a doctor in attendance , johnny zellmer , who tried three times to get the iv into the jugular vein in lockett 's neck but failed . the executive director of the death penalty information center , richard dieter , said the attempted execution of lockett was a `` torturous action '' and might `` lead to a halt in executions until states can prove they can do it without problems '' . he said the death penalty advocates should be `` concerned about whether the state knows what it is doing '' . before the execution , lockett 's stepmother ladonna hollins was reported as saying , `` i want to know what mixture of drugs are you going to use now ? is this instant ? is this going to cause horrible pain ? '' and `` i know he 's scared .
tarantino discovered the centerpiece for the work in 2009 while filming a movie with an actor that had the same stunt double for 20 years . even though there was nothing but a small bit for the stuntman to do , tarantino was asked to use him , and he agreed . the relationship fascinated tarantino and inspired him to make a film about hollywood . tarantino said that while the stuntman may have been a perfect double for the actor years earlier , at the time he had come to meet them , `` this was maybe the last or second-to-last thing they 'd be doing together '' . the `` little three '' -lrb- universal studios , united artists , and columbia pictures -rrb- , who did not own any theaters , refused to participate in the consent decree . a number of independent film producers were also unhappy with the compromise and formed a union known as the society of independent motion picture producers and sued paramount for the monopoly they still had over the detroit theaters -- as paramount was also gaining dominance through actors like bob hope , paulette goddard , veronica lake , betty hutton , crooner bing crosby , alan ladd , and longtime actor for studio gary cooper too - by 1942 . the big five studios did not meet the requirements of the consent of decree during wwii , without major consequence , but after the war ended they joined paramount as defendants in the hollywood antitrust case , as did the little three studios . most hollywood pictures adhered closely to a formula -- western , slapstick comedy , musical , animated cartoon , biographical film -lrb- biographical picture -rrb- -- and the same creative teams often worked on films made by the same studio . for example , cedric gibbons and herbert stothart always worked on mgm films , alfred newman worked at 20th century fox for twenty years , cecil b. de mille 's films were almost all made at paramount , and director henry king 's films were mostly made for 20th century fox .
after a massive resurgence of american militia groups following president barack obama 's 2008 election , the southern poverty law center -- which tracks data on the anti-government movement -- reported a decline in patriot groups in 2016 . in its annual report , the splc found that patriot groups dropped 38 % last year and that militias within the patriot movement dropped 40 % . the organization attributed this decrease to '' -lrb- hope -rrb- that -lrb- donald -rrb- trump would become the new face of the federal government . '' so what about american militias not identified and analyzed by the splc in its annual report ? five months after his indy 500 adventure , fernando alonso is set to return to action stateside as formula one gears up for the united states grand prix in austin . alonso may have failed in his bid to win the indianapolis 500 as a rookie in may -- his engine blew up with 21 laps to go of the 200-lap race -- but he came away with a huge admiration for american motorsport fans . `` it 's a different culture , a different way of understanding motorsport or sport in general -- much more open , much more friendly to all of us , '' alonso told cnn 's the circuit . `` i imagine if the -lrb- indy 500 -rrb- was in spain and some us people came here our favorites would be the spanish sportsmen and we would cheer for them massively , '' he added , speaking at his karting circuit in his home town of oviedo in northern spain . the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical , geographical , and political context in which it is used . american is derived from america , a term originally denoting all of the new world -lrb- also called the americas -rrb- . in some expressions , it retains this pan-american sense , but its usage has evolved over time and , for various historical reasons , the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america . in modern english , american generally refers to persons or things related to the united states of america ; among native english speakers this usage is almost universal , with any other use of the term requiring specification .
at that time the compliments he paid me were so generous that i blush to remember them . but now that i have come out for socialism he reminds me and the public that i am blind and deaf and especially liable to error . i must have shrunk in intelligence during the years since i met him . ... oh , ridiculous brooklyn eagle ! according to those who attended , helen keller spoke of the joy that life gave her . she was thankful for the faculties and abilities that she did possess and stated that the most productive pleasures she had were curiosity and imagination . keller also spoke of the joy of service and the happiness that came from doing things for others ... keller imparted that `` helping your fellow men were one 's only excuse for being in this world and in the doing of things to help one 's fellows lay the secret of lasting happiness . '' she also told of the joys of loving work and accomplishment and the happiness of achievement . a message of optimism , of hope , of good cheer , and of loving service was brought to menomonie saturday -- a message that will linger long with those fortunate enough to have received it . this message came with the visit of helen keller and her teacher , mrs. john macy , and both had a hand in imparting it saturday evening to a splendid audience that filled the memorial . the wonderful girl who has so brilliantly triumphed over the triple afflictions of blindness , dumbness and deafness , gave a talk with her own lips on `` happiness , '' and it will be remembered always as a piece of inspired teaching by those who heard it .
the museum of early american folk arts , as it was known initially , held its first exhibition in a rented space on 49 west 53rd street in 1961 . the museum 's collection was launched in 1962 with the gift of a gate in the form of an american flag , celebrating the nation 's centennial . the gift reflected the museum 's early focus on eighteenth and nineteenth-century vernacular arts from the northeast america . the museum also gained international prominence with the hugely successful and now famous picasso retrospective of 1939 -- 40 , held in conjunction with the art institute of chicago . in its range of presented works , it represented a significant reinterpretation of picasso for future art scholars and historians . this was wholly masterminded by barr , a picasso enthusiast , and the exhibition lionized picasso as the greatest artist of the time , setting the model for all the museum 's retrospectives that were to follow . boy leading a horse was briefly contested over ownership with the solomon r. guggenheim museum . the girard wing , with its popular exhibition , multiple visions : a common bond , showcases folk art , popular art , toys and textiles from more than 100 nations . the exhibition is unique in that it was designed by the donor , alexander girard , a leading architect and designer . the collection includes toys and dolls , costumes , masks , textiles of all kinds , religious folk art , paintings , beadwork , and more . more than a million visitors have passed through the doors into the special world of girard since the exhibition opened in 1982 .
i think the grammys are nothing more than some gigantic promotional machine for the music industry . they cater to a low intellect and they feed the masses . they do n't honor the arts or the artist for what he created . it 's the music business celebrating itself . prior to the first live grammys telecast in 1971 on abc , a series of filmed annual specials in the 1960s called the best on record were broadcast on nbc . the first grammy award telecast took place on the night of november 29 , 1959 , as an episode of the nbc anthology series nbc sunday showcase , which was normally devoted to plays , original tv dramas , and variety shows . until 1971 , awards ceremonies were held in both new york and los angeles , with winners accepting at one of the two . pierre cossette bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the national academy of recording arts and sciences and organized the first live telecast . the grammys had their origin in the hollywood walk of fame project in the 1950s . as the recording executives chosen for the walk of fame committee worked at compiling a list of important recording industry people who might qualify for a walk of fame star , they realized there were many more people who were leaders in their business who would never earn a star on hollywood boulevard . the music executives decided to rectify this by creating an award given by their industry similar to the oscars and the emmys . this was the beginning of the national academy of recording arts and sciences .
one of the focal tracks of the carver city story is said to be `` the boardwalk body '' , which was written by miller based on a true story wherein a dead body was discovered during one of his family holidays in wildwood , new jersey . speaking about the story , the vocalist and guitarist noted that it happened when he was `` 11 or 12 '' years old and described it as `` a really bizarre period of learning for me '' . lana cooper of the website popmatters has proposed that the song is a sequel to an earlier track on the album , '' ... and she never returned '' , in which a young woman goes missing and is never found , presumed to be murdered . in the heroes of olympus story `` the lost hero , '' there was a reference to the mythical jason when jason grace and his friends encounter medea . the production of carver city was plagued by a number of problems , including disagreements between band members . in october 2007 , ginsburg claimed that miller had left the band after it was reported that a `` physical altercation '' had broken about . miller explained that he had confronted ginsburg and margera after he heard them say some `` extremely personal , painful things '' about him , and that he was considering returning to the group after dealing with his increasing problems with alcohol abuse . after almost a year of inactivity , it was reported in october 2008 that cky was back together , with miller claiming that the band was `` 98 % done tracking '' carver city .
in the united states , the full magnitude and impact of errors in health care was not appreciated until the 1990s , when several reports brought attention to this issue . in 1999 , the institute of medicine -lrb- iom -rrb- of the national academy of sciences released a report , to err is human : building a safer health system . the iom called for a broad national effort to include establishment of a center for patient safety , expanded reporting of adverse events , development of safety programs in health care organizations , and attention by regulators , health care purchasers , and professional societies . the majority of media attention , however , focused on the staggering statistics : from 44,000 to 98,000 preventable deaths annually due to medical error in hospitals , 7,000 preventable deaths related to medication errors alone . pediatric -lrb- also paediatric or pædiatric -rrb- dentists promote the dental health of children as well as serve as educational resources for parents . it is recommended by the american academy of pediatric dentistry -lrb- aapd -rrb- and the american academy of pediatrics -lrb- aap -rrb- that a dental visit should occur within six months after the presence of the first tooth or by a child 's first birthday . the aapd has said that it is important to establish a comprehensive and accessible ongoing relationship between the dentist and patient -- referring to this as the patient 's `` dental home '' . this is because early oral examination aids in the detection of the early stages of tooth decay . over the last several years , pediatric groups have partnered to improve general understanding , reporting , process improvement methodologies , and quality of pediatric inpatient care . these collaborations have created a robust program of projects , benchmarking efforts , and research . much of the research and focus on adverse events has been on medication errors -- the most frequently reported adverse event for both adult and pediatric patients . it is also of interest to note that medication errors are also the most preventable type of harm that can occur within the pediatric population .
mcdonald 's corporation is an american fast food company , founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by richard and maurice mcdonald , in san bernardino , california , united states . they rechristened their business as a hamburger stand , and later turned the company into a franchise , with the golden arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in phoenix , arizona . in 1955 , ray kroc , a businessman , joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the mcdonald brothers . mcdonald 's had its original headquarters in oak brook , illinois , but moved its global headquarters to chicago in early 2018 . mcdonald 's is the world 's largest restaurant chain by revenue , serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries across 37,855 outlets as of 2018 . in 2013 , the university of oxford estimated that in the succeeding decades , there was a 92 % probability of food preparation and serving to become automated in fast food establishments . by 2016 , mcdonald 's `` create your taste '' electronic kiosks were seen in some restaurants internationally where customers could custom order meals . as employees pushed for higher wages in the late-2010s , some believed that fast food companies such as mcdonald 's would use the devices to cut costs for employing individuals . after a person had ordered , mcdonald 's advised that wait times were between 10 -- 15 minutes . when the food was ready , trained crew -lrb- ` hosts ' -rrb- brought the food to the customer 's table . instead of mcdonald 's usual cardboard and plastic packaging , cyt food was presented on wooden boards , fries in wire baskets and salads in china bowls with metal cutlery . a higher price applied .
the pew research center released its 10th annual report on global restrictions on religion as part of the pew-templeton global religious futures project , funded by the pew charitable trusts and the john templeton foundation . while the previous reports focused on year-over-year change , this report provides a broader look at the trend in particular regions and in 198 countries . the report documents how government restrictions on religion and social hostilities involving religion have changed and increased , from 2007 to 2017 . it said 52 governments impose high levels of restrictions on religion , up from 40 in 2007 , while 56 countries experienced the highest levels of social hostilities involving religion , up from 38 in 2007 . in france , while year-long mandatory military service for men was abolished in 1996 by president jacques chirac , who wanted to build a professional all-volunteer military , all citizens between 17 and 25 years of age must still participate in the defense and citizenship day -lrb- japd -rrb- , when they are introduced to the french armed forces , and take language tests . a 2015 ifop poll revealed that 80 % of the french people supported some kind of mandatory service , military , or civilian . the rationale for the reintroduction of national service was that `` france needs powerful tools to help promote integration , mix young people of different social backgrounds and levels , and to instill republican values and national cohesion . '' at the same time , returning to conscription was also popular ; supporters included 90 % of the ump party , 89 % of the national front -lrb- now the national rally -rrb- , 71 % of the socialist party , and 67 % of people aged 18 to 24 , even though they would be affected the most . in march 2014 , the pew research center issued a report about how `` millennials in adulthood '' are `` detached from institutions and networked with friends . '' the report said millennials are somewhat more upbeat than older adults about america 's future , with 49 % of millennials saying the country 's best years are ahead , though they 're the first in the modern era to have higher levels of student loan debt and unemployment .
however , the growth and profitability of the aol division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers . the value of the america online division dropped significantly , not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell , and forced a goodwill write-off , causing aol time warner to report a loss of $ 99 billion in 2002 -- at the time , the largest loss ever reported by a company . the total value of aol stock subsequently went from $ 226 billion to about $ 20 billion . aol was one of the early pioneers of the internet in the mid-1990s , and the most recognized brand on the web in the united states . it originally provided a dial-up service to millions of americans , as well as providing a web portal , e-mail , instant messaging and later a web browser following its purchase of netscape . in 2001 , at the height of its popularity , it purchased the media conglomerate time warner in the largest merger in u.s. history . aol rapidly declined thereafter , partly due to the decline of dial-up and rise of broadband . warner media , llc is an american multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate owned by at&t and headquartered in new york city . it was originally formed in 1990 as time warner , from the merger of time inc. and warner communications . the company has film , television and cable operations , with its assets including warnermedia entertainment -lrb- consisting of the entertainment assets of turner , hbo , otter media , and cinemax , as well as hbo max streaming service -rrb- , warnermedia news & sports -lrb- consisting of the news and sports assets of turner , as well as at&t sportsnet -rrb- , and warner bros. -lrb- consisting of the film , animation , and television studios , dc comics , new line cinema , the family-friendly assets of turner , and a 50 % interest in the cw -rrb- . on october 22 , 2016 , at&t announced an offer to acquire time warner for $ 108.7 billion -lrb- including assumed time warner debt -rrb- .
president donald trump signed his first bill into law friday , moments after being sworn in , clearing the way for his defense secretary to be confirmed . the 45th president signed a bill passed by congress earlier this month that would allow retired gen. james mattis to serve as defense secretary by waiving the legal requirement that he be out of the military for seven years before doing so , according to white house press secretary sean spicer . mattis will still need to be confirmed by the senate , which is expected friday afternoon . cameras rolled as trump signed his first orders as president in the capitol , surrounded by congressional leaders . trump 's presidency has been marked by significant public concern about conflict of interest stemming from his diverse business ventures . in the lead up to his inauguration , trump promised to remove himself from the day-to-day operations of his businesses . trump placed his sons eric trump and donald trump jr. at the head of his businesses claiming they would not communicate with him regarding his interests . however , critics noted that this would not prevent him from having input into his businesses and knowing how to benefit himself , and trump continued to receive quarterly updates on his businesses . donald trump placed the wreath at arlington national cemetery in one of the kick-off ceremonial events in advance of his inauguration at the capitol on friday . flanked by mike pence and standing before his children and families , trump laid the wreath at the tomb of the unknowns in arlington , virginia . tom barrack , the chair of trump 's inaugural committee and a close friend , said trump was `` transitioning from candidate to president . '' `` if you look at his eyes at arlington , you see in that moment , in that anticipation of that peaceful transfer of partisan power , that the rhetoric of the campaign moves aside , '' he told cnn 's dana bash and jake tapper .
ericsson had decided to obtain chips for its phones from a single source -- a philips facility in new mexico . on march 17 , 2000 , a fire at the philips factory contaminated the sterile facility . philips assured ericsson and nokia -lrb- their other major customer -rrb- that production would be delayed for no more than a week . when it became clear that production would actually be compromised for months , ericsson was faced with a serious shortage . like its predecessors , the playstation 3 was re-released in 2009 as a `` slim '' model . the redesigned model is 33 % smaller , 36 % lighter , and consumes 34 % to 45 % less power than previous models . in addition , it features a redesigned cooling system and a smaller cell processor which was moved to a 45nm manufacturing process . it sold in excess of a million units within its first 3 weeks on sale . sony ericsson 's strategy was to release new models capable of digital photography as well as other multimedia capabilities such as downloading and viewing video clips and personal information management capabilities . to this end , it released several new models which had built-in digital camera and colour screen which were novelties at that time - examples include the sony ericsson t610 , the p800 uiq smartphone , and later the k700 handset . the joint venture continued to make bigger losses in spite of booming sales - however it paid off as sony ericsson made its first profit in 2003 and in the following years steadily increased handset sales . the joint venture was regarded to have been a success .
initially , bp downplayed the incident ; its ceo tony hayward called the amount of oil and dispersant `` relatively tiny '' in comparison with the `` very big ocean . '' later , he drew an outpouring of criticism when he said that the spill was a disruption to gulf coast residents and himself adding , `` you know , i 'd like my life back . '' bp 's chief operating officer doug suttles contradicted the underwater plume discussion noting , `` it may be down to how you define what a plume is here ... the oil that has been found is in very minute quantities . '' in june , bp launched a pr campaign and successfully bid for several search terms related to the spill on google and other search engines so that the first sponsored search result linked directly to the company 's website . the mark twain project of the bancroft library undertook to produce a complete autobiography of twain , based upon material within their collection . the stated goal is `` to publish the complete text as nearly as possible in the way mark twain intended it to be published after his death . '' . this was published in three-volumes between 2010 and 2015 , with the first in the 100th anniversary year of twain 's death . all three volumes are available online with introductions and historical annotation from the editors also included with the text . in 1901 , twain criticized the actions of the missionary dr. william scott ament -lrb- 1851 -- 1909 -rrb- because ament and other missionaries had collected indemnities from chinese subjects in the aftermath of the boxer uprising of 1900 . twain 's response to hearing of ament 's methods was published in the north american review in february 1901 : to the person sitting in darkness , and deals with examples of imperialism in china , south africa , and with the u.s. occupation of the philippines . a subsequent article , `` to my missionary critics '' published in the north american review in april 1901 , unapologetically continues his attack , but with the focus shifted from ament to his missionary superiors , the american board of commissioners for foreign missions .
first presbyterian 's original pastor was james anderson , who had been preaching in new york to the small-but-growing scots population , whose influence increased with the appointment of a number of scotsmen to be governors of the new york colony . during the american revolution , the church became known as the `` church of patriots '' due to many from its congregation being involved in the effort against great britain . their dissatisfaction partly arose partly because the king had consistently refused to issue the church a charter in 1766 and afterwards , claiming a duty to uphold the exclusive rights of the church of england , represented in new york by trinity church . first presbyterian 's pastor from 1765 to 1811 , john rodgers , had to leave the city during the british occupation because of his activities . in 1833 , lyman beecher was called as pastor of second presbyterian and president of lane theological seminary . during his tenure in town , he had a falling out with joshua lacy wilson , the pastor of first presbyterian . wilson eventually charged beecher with heresy . though beecher was acquitted by the higher governing bodies of the church , his ministry was compromised , and he left in 1843 . in 1918 , first presbyterian merged with the presbyterian churches of madison square and university place , forming what was then known as '' `` the first presbyterian church in the city of new york , founded 1716 -- old first , university place and madison square foundation , '' but referred to colloquially as `` new york 's presbyterian cathedral . '' that same year , harry emerson fosdick assumed the role of pastor of first presbyterian church . fosdick proved to be a charismatic preacher and resulted in the growth of the congregation . the increased size of the congregation necessitated the lengthening of the church in 1919 , with the addition of a chancel .
mckean stated that with gilligan and gould 's approach , that they are generally told at the start of the season what they would like to see the characters go , but only in two or three episodes before filming , having firmer ideas about specific actions , but that he trusts the showrunners were doing the right thing with the character . mckean spoke of when he got his `` death call '' from gilligan and gould , letting him known that chuck would die in the third season finale `` lantern '' , around the time of filming of the seventh episode `` expenses '' . mckean had expected the call based on the character 's arc , and had no regrets or issues with it , since `` that chuck did not belong in jimmy 's universe by the time he becomes saul goodman , so i knew that it was very possible '' . vince gilligan and peter gould began planning a television spinoff of breaking bad as early as 2009 . while filming `` full measure '' , gilligan asked bob odenkirk , the actor of series character saul goodman , what he thought of a spinoff of the show . in july 2012 gilligan hinted at a possible goodman spinoff , stating that he liked `` the idea of a lawyer show in which the main lawyer will do anything it takes to stay out of a court of law '' , including settling on the courthouse steps . during his appearance on talking bad , odenkirk noted that saul was one of the most popular characters on the show , speculating that the audience likes the character because he is the program 's least hypocritical figure , and is good at his job . like its predecessor , better call saul is set and filmed primarily in and around albuquerque , new mexico . notable locations include the twisters restaurant used previously in breaking bad for gus 's los pollos hermanos , a parking lot kiosk at the albuquerque convention center for where mike worked in the first few seasons , the old bernalillo county courthouse as the local courthouse , and two nearby office buildings in the north valley , include northrop grumman 's , that collectively are used for the hhm office spaces . jimmy 's back office is located in an actual nail salon , which the producers worked with the owners to accommodate , while the salamanca 's restaurant is also a real business in the south valley that production modified a bit for the show , but otherwise remained an open business outside of filming . the scenes set in omaha are actually filmed at cottonwood mall in albuquerque ; production worked with cinnabon to bring in the period-specific equipment and service items for the segments , and the extras in the store during these scenes are cinnabon employees .

'' after facing criticism about the tone and accuracy of these comments , he at first characterized them as `` inelegantly stated '' , then a couple of weeks later commented : `` i said something that 's just completely wrong . '' mitt romney 's efforts to turn round his presidential campaign were thrown off course after video clips emerged in which he said us president barack obama could count on the support of 47 per cent of americans who are `` dependent on government '' , do not pay tax and `` believe that they are victims '' . the clips were posted on the website of mother jones , a liberal magazine , and were widely circulated via twitter , creating more distractions for the romney campaign at a time when many republicans fear that it is veering off track . in one clip , romney says : `` there are 47 per cent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what . . the controversy over the comments that mitt romney made about obama supporters during a private fundraiser in may continues to unfold this morning after secretly recorded videos of the meeting were leaked last night . regarding the millions of americans who rely on government support , romney comments , `` my job is not to worry about those people . i 'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives .

palin reportedly prepared intensively for the october 2 vice-presidential debate with democratic vice-presidential nominee joe biden at washington university in st. louis . some republicans suggested that palin 's performance in the interviews would improve public perceptions of her debate performance by lowering expectations . polling from cnn , fox and cbs found that while palin exceeded most voters ' expectations , they felt that biden had won the debate . palin was reported to have prepared intensively for the october 2 vice-presidential debate with democratic vice-presidential nominee joe biden at washington university in st. louis . some republicans suggested that palin 's performance in the interviews would improve public perceptions of her debate performance by lowering expectations . polling from cnn , fox and cbs found that while palin exceeded most voters ' expectations , they felt that biden had won the debate . henry alfred kissinger -lrb- ; german : ; born heinz alfred kissinger ; may 27 , 1923 -rrb- is an american politician , diplomat , and geopolitical consultant who served as united states secretary of state and national security advisor under the presidential administrations of richard nixon and gerald ford . a jewish refugee who fled nazi germany with his family in 1938 , he became national security advisor in 1969 and u.s. secretary of state in 1973 . for his actions negotiating a ceasefire in vietnam , kissinger received the 1973 nobel peace prize under controversial circumstances , with two members of the committee resigning in protest . kissinger later sought , unsuccessfully , to return the prize after the ceasefire failed.a practitioner of realpolitik , kissinger played a prominent role in united states foreign policy between 1969 and 1977 .
the supreme court of the united states -lrb- scotus -rrb- is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the united states . it has ultimate -lrb- and largely discretionary -rrb- appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law , and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases , specifically `` all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party '' . the court holds the power of judicial review , the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the u.s. constitution . it is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the constitution or statutory law . since article three of the united states constitution stipulates that federal courts may only entertain `` cases '' or `` controversies '' , the supreme court can not decide cases that are moot and it does not render advisory opinions , as the supreme courts of some states may do . for example , in defunis v. odegaard , 416 u.s. 312 -lrb- 1974 -rrb- , the court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit , and a decision from the court on his claim would not be able to redress any injury he had suffered . however , the court recognizes some circumstances where it is appropriate to hear a case that is seemingly moot . if an issue is `` capable of repetition yet evading review '' , the court will address it even though the party before the court would not himself be made whole by a favorable result . the federal court system and the judicial authority to interpret the constitution received little attention in the debates over the drafting and ratification of the constitution . the power of judicial review , in fact , is nowhere mentioned in it . over the ensuing years , the question of whether the power of judicial review was even intended by the drafters of the constitution was quickly frustrated by the lack of evidence bearing on the question either way . nevertheless , the power of judiciary to overturn laws and executive actions it determines are unlawful or unconstitutional is a well-established precedent .
the white knights of the ku klux klan is a chapter of the ku klux klan . they originated in mississippi and louisiana in the early 1960s under the leadership of samuel bowers , its first grand wizard . the white knights of mississippi were formed in 1964 , and they included roughly 200 members of the original knights of louisiana . the white knights were not interested in holding public demonstrations or in letting any information about themselves get out to the masses . in 2017 , members of the group participated in the unite the right rally in charlottesville , virginia alongside the confederate white knights of the ku klux klan , the alt-right , neo-nazis , white nationalists/supremacists , southern nationalists/neo-confederates , identitarians , the american guard , fraternal order of the knights , certain members of the proud boys , and various militia groups . earlier the loyal white knights of the ku klux klan had held a rally in charlottesville on july 8 with 50 members and hundreds of counter-protesters . in july 2017 , chris barker was interviewed by univision 's ilia calderón . during the interview , he called calderón `` a nigger '' and stated that his group was going `` to burn you out '' . in addition to the structure outlined above , there are documented cases of organs of slightly different nomenclature from reconstruction . for instance , a group of twenty men who were arrested on april 6 , 1868 , at their `` den '' at the corners of beale street and hernando street in memphis , was called the supreme cyclopean council . the constitution that the police captured outlined an organization with a grand cyclops , vice-grand cyclops , and secretary and openly advocated assassination of the `` murders and robbers '' now ruling the south . members were bound to participate in the activities of the order , even if it meant leaving the `` embraces '' of their wife .
the wsr-88d doppler weather radar system , also called nexrad , was developed by the national weather service during the mid-1980s , and fully deployed throughout the majority of the united states by 1997 . there are 158 such radar sites in operation in the u.s. , its various territorial possessions and selected overseas locations . this technology , because of its high resolution and ability to detect intra-cloud motions , is now the cornerstone of the agency 's severe weather warning operations . the national weather service -lrb- nws -rrb- is an agency of the united states federal government that is tasked with providing weather forecasts , warnings of hazardous weather , and other weather-related products to organizations and the public for the purposes of protection , safety , and general information . it is a part of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- branch of the department of commerce , and is headquartered in silver spring , maryland , within the washington metropolitan area . the agency was known as the united states weather bureau from 1890 until it adopted its current name in 1970 . national weather service paducah is a weather forecast office responsible for monitoring weather conditions for 58 counties in the states of kentucky , illinois , indiana and missouri . the paducah office is relatively new compared to others , having been built in 1984 . the office is in charge of weather forecasts , warnings and local statements as well as aviation weather . it is also equipped with a wsr-88d -lrb- nexrad -rrb- radar , and an automated surface observing system -lrb- asos -rrb- that greatly increase the ability to forecast .
wayne lapierre , the nation 's most visible gun-rights advocate , rallied supporters on saturday for a renewed fight against gun control , saying membership is up since the newtown massacre , and calling the effort to stop new limits a `` long war '' and a `` fight for everything we care about . '' the national rifle association 's executive vice president vowed in remarks at the group 's national convention that `` we will never surrender our guns . '' he implored members to step up their outreach to members of congress as part of a fight against `` elites '' and others who `` use tragedy to try to blame us , to shame us '' into compromise and who `` want to change america , our culture and our values . '' lapierre delivered a speech heavy on militaristic and sweeping patriotic rhetoric . on july 20 , 2012 , aurora was the site of the third largest mass shooting in terms of number of casualties in united states history at the time , now the eighteenth largest , and the second-deadliest shooting in colorado after the 1999 columbine high school massacre . the shooting occurred just after midnight , when james eagan holmes opened fire during the midnight premiere of the dark knight rises in a century movie theater , killing 12 people and injuring 70 others . holmes was arrested within 2 minutes of the incident , and was sentenced to 12 life sentences in prison with an additional required 3,318 years . the shooting drew an international response from world leaders . in a 2019 politico article , nagr president dudley brown described the differences between his organization and the nra `` as an organization , we do n't use gucci-loafered lobbyists in washington , d.c. in $ 200,000 wardrobes to grease the palms of weak-kneed politicians to vote right , '' said dudley brown , president of the national association for gun rights , referencing the nra chief executive 's purported lavish spending . `` instead , we activate our members to do that lobbying for us and for them . that 's the power in a grassroots lobby and nra lost that a long time ago . ''
on october 8 , 2019 , in a letter from white house counsel pat cipollone to house speaker pelosi and the three committee chairmen conducting the impeachment investigation , the white house announced that it would not cooperate with the investigation . in the letter , cipollone said the investigation `` violates the constitution , the rule of law , and every past precedent '' and that `` the president can not allow your constitutionally illegitimate proceedings to distract him and those in the executive branch . '' the letter went on to say '' unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice . to fulfill his duties to the american people , the constitution , the executive branch , and all future occupants of the office of the presidency , president trump and his administration can not participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances . '' after months of wrangling , the senate 's impeachment trial , at last , began this week . but that does n't mean the wrangling is over . the democrats acting as the house 's impeachment managers have spent the week arguing why president donald trump should be impeached , and have sought to aim their message at convincing four republicans to vote with them for witnesses in the trial . republicans , meanwhile , say the democrats are n't doing anything new . the white house officially responded to the impeachment proceedings in a letter from white house counsel pat cipollone to house speaker pelosi that it would cease all cooperation with the investigation due to a litany of concerns , including that there had been no vote of the full house , and the secrecy of the proceedings . in the october 8 letter , the white house officially declined to cooperate with what they claimed was an illegitimate effort `` to overturn the results of the 2016 election '' . the eight-page letter said the investigation `` violates the constitution , the rule of law , and every past precedent '' . pelosi responded to the letter : `` the white house should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president 's abuse of power from the american people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction . ''
on 14 february , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , the supreme leader of iran and one of the most prominent shi'a muslim leaders , issued a fatwa calling for the death of rushdie and his publishers . this created a major international incident that persisted for decades . the satanic verses controversy , also known as the rushdie affair , was the heated and frequently violent reaction of muslims to the publication of salman rushdie 's novel the satanic verses , which was first published in the united kingdom in 1988 and inspired in part by the life of muhammad . many muslims accused rushdie of blasphemy or unbelief and in 1989 the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran issued a fatwa ordering muslims to kill rushdie . numerous killings , attempted killings , and bombings resulted in response to the novel . i never called for the death of salman rushdie ; nor backed the fatwa issued by the ayatollah khomeini -- and still do n't . the book itself destroyed the harmony between peoples and created an unnecessary international crisis .
speaker nancy pelosi scheduled the vote for june 26 , 2009 . the week leading up to the vote was marked by courting moderate republicans and on-the-fence democrats from rural and coal districts to support the legislation in what was expected to be a close vote . on the day of the vote , democrats were still working to ensure they had the votes needed to pass the bill . republicans tried to pull back their proposed amendments , realizing they were giving the democrats more time to corral votes , however , they were unable to pull their proposed amendments off the floor . after passage by both houses , a bill is enrolled and sent to the president for approval . the president may sign it making it law or veto it , perhaps returning it to congress with the president 's objections . a vetoed bill can still become law if each house of congress votes to override the veto with a two-thirds majority . finally , the president may do nothing -- neither signing nor vetoing the bill -- and then the bill becomes law automatically after ten days -lrb- not counting sundays -rrb- according to the constitution . in the 116th united states congress , it is a pair of resolutions , house resolution 109 and s. res . 59 , sponsored by rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez -lrb- d-ny -rrb- and sen. ed markey -lrb- d-ma -rrb- . on march 25 , 2019 , markey 's resolution failed to advance in the u.s. senate in a margin of 0 -- 57 , with most senate democrats voting `` present '' in protest of an early vote called by republicans . among the public , there is consistently high support among democrats for the green new deal , whereas republicans , in particular fox news watchers , opposed the green new deal .
confederate col. joseph c. porter had been recruiting in the macon area , to the south of kirksville . he had assembled a brigade of between 1,500 and 2,500 ill-trained and poorly equipped troops , but his irregulars had harried and recruited as far north as memphis , missouri . confederate sympathies in the kirksville area were high -lrb- though union sentiment was stronger than in surrounding counties -rrb- , due to the southern heritage of most of the residents . porter had been urged to come to kirksville by confederate captain tice cain , an adair county farmer who claimed to be holding kirksville with 500 fresh recruits -lrb- in one of the battle 's mysteries , cain disappeared and was never heard from again , according to a descendant -rrb- . huntsman has repeatedly stated , `` we need to continue working closely with china to convince north korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program '' . he has also named taiwan , human rights , and tibet among the `` areas where we have differences with china '' and vowed `` robust engagement '' as ambassador . huntsman , who lived in taiwan as a mormon missionary , said he felt `` personally invested in the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences , in a way that respects the wishes of the people on both taiwan and the mainland . in 2009 , he said that then-current u.s. policy `` support this objective , and encouraged by the recent relaxing of cross-strait tensions . '' in march 1944 , ward was posted to india . the army still found it difficult to accommodate him , and he spent much time canvassing for the proper recognition of osteopathy while being officially assigned to non-medical duties . however , he found opportunities to practise his skills ; among those whom he treated was mahatma gandhi , who impressed ward : `` although much of his policy was opposed to that of my own country . i knew that when i was with him i was in the presence of greatness , and my encounter with him was certainly the most important meeting of my life '' .
early christians believed that the words of the gospel of john 1:18 : `` no man has seen god at any time '' and numerous other statements were meant to apply not only to god , but to all attempts at the depiction of god . at least some jews do not use any image for god , since god is the unimaginable being who can not be represented in material forms . in some samples of jewish art , however , sometimes god , or at least his intervention , is indicated by a hand of god symbol , which represents the bath kol -lrb- literally `` daughter of a voice '' -rrb- or voice of god . many traditions see god as incorporeal and eternal , and regard him as a point of living light like human souls , but without a physical body , as he does not enter the cycle of birth , death and rebirth . god is seen as the perfect and constant embodiment of all virtues , powers and values and that he is the unconditionally loving father of all souls , irrespective of their religion , gender , or culture .
chief justice john roberts swore in senators last week to officially begin the impeachment trial of president donald trump , but the trial starts in earnest tuesday afternoon , when republicans and democrats are expected to battle over a resolution setting the rules for the trial and start opening arguments shortly afterward . senate majority leader mitch mcconnell will propose a timeline for the trial that would break from the impeachment trial of president bill clinton , according to a four-page organizing resolution obtained by cnn . it 's possible senators will vote to go into closed session in order to debate the issues that divide them because impeachment rules prevent them from speaking publicly during the trial . here 's what we know : when will the trial get started ? the third senate impeachment trial of a us president in history convened on thursday with the reading of the impeachment articles against president donald trump and the swearing in of supreme court chief justice john roberts and the senators who will decide whether trump should be removed from office . the senate conducted its ceremonial functions of the impeachment trial on thursday before the actual arguments will get underway next tuesday . house intelligence chairman adam schiff , a california democrat and the lead impeachment manager , read the articles aloud in the chamber while senators looked on from their desks . live updates : the latest on president trump 's impeachment roberts was sworn in shortly several hours later . the house on wednesday formally presented two articles of impeachment to the senate after voting to approve the seven managers to prosecute the case against president donald trump , a long-awaited move that marks the beginning of the third senate impeachment trial of a us president in history . the house managers walked the articles across the capitol just after 5 p.m. et on wednesday . the articles were received by the senate , and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said that the house managers would formally present the articles at noon et thursday .

the house voted on tuesday night to condemn racist language from president donald trump , capping off a tumultuous couple of hours on capitol hill including a brief time in which house speaker nancy pelosi was barred from speaking in the chamber . the vote was 240-187 . four republicans and one independent -- rep. justin amash of michigan -- supported it as well as all democrats who voted . democratic rep. ilhan omar of minnesota , one of the congresswomen trump attacked , said tuesday 's vote sent a message to young kids who `` are wrestling with the weight of those words now coming from the president , that we hear them , we see them and we never will allow anybody to tell them that this is n't their country . '' the four original members of the squad had already been discussed as a group , even before the name was widely adopted . however , according to mediaite , the news media currently uses `` squad '' to refer to the group `` almost exclusively '' . the onion posted a satirical article claiming that 82-year-old representative bill pascrell had asked to join , which was jokingly confirmed by him and accepted by omar . following its publication , pascrell retweeted the onion article , tagging ocasio-cortez , omar , pressley , and tlaib to ask if he could join . after the president of the united states spent the day openly encouraging a group of critical congresswomen of color to leave the country , the four democratic lawmakers made clear monday they 're here to stay . `` i want to tell children across this country is that no matter what the president says , this country belongs to you , '' said rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york at a news conference on capitol hill on monday . `` and it belongs to everyone and today that notion , that very notion was challenged .

democratic presidential candidate pete buttigieg said tuesday that he understands the criticism he has received for comments he made in 2011 about the challenges facing minority communities in education . during a 2011 public television broadcast while he was a candidate for mayor of south bend , indiana , buttigieg said children `` need to see evidence that education is going to work for them ... and there are a lot of kids , especially in the lower income , minority neighborhoods , who literally just have n't seen it work . there is n't somebody they know personally who testifies the value of education .

president donald trump appeared to contradict his most senior security officials monday , downplaying recent attacks on two tankers in the gulf of oman that his administration has blamed on iran as `` very minor . '' and days after secretary of state mike pompeo said the administration continues to consider military options for dealing with iran , trump dismissed the idea in an interview with time magazine . asked whether he was considering military action against tehran , the president told time , `` i would n't say that . i ca n't say that at all . '' president donald trump and his national security adviser , john bolton , are engaged in an ongoing debate about how to handle iran , a senior white house official told cnn . trump moved to ease tensions with iran on thursday morning after tehran downed a us drone near the persian gulf . in doing so , he struck a starkly different tone on iran from bolton and other senior security aides . after months of escalating steps by iran and the us , trump said iran 's attack on the drone was probably an unintentional `` mistake . '' united states national security adviser john bolton warned sunday that iran should not `` mistake us prudence and discretion for weakness , '' days after president donald trump called off a retaliatory military strike against iran after the downing of an american drone . bolton also warned of the possibility of a strike against iran in the future during a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu in jerusalem . `` neither iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake us prudence and discretion for weakness . no one has granted them a hunting license in the middle east , '' bolton , who has publicly and repeatedly called for regime change in tehran in the past , said .
as pope , francis has repeatedly spoken about the need for the church to welcome and love all people , regardless of their sexual orientation . speaking about gay people in 2013 , he said that `` the key is for the church to welcome , not exclude and show mercy , not condemnation . '' in july of that year , he said `` if someone is gay and is searching for the lord and has good will , then who am i to judge him ? the catechism of the catholic church explains this in a beautiful way , saying ... : ` no one should marginalize these people for this , they must be integrated into society . ' '' a day after hundreds of thousands of people protested gun violence at march for our lives events in the us and around the globe , pope francis called on the world 's youth to continue speaking out and standing up . `` dear young people , you have it in you to shout , '' the pope said in his palm sunday address at st. peter 's square in rome . palm sunday -- celebrated on the sunday before easter -- is commemorated by christians as the day jesus entered jerusalem in the week of his crucifixion , when palm leaves were strewn in his path . noting that this palm sunday coincides with world youth day , the pontiff used the opportunity to compare youth to jesus 's followers , who were scorned by his detractors . an ohio family got a miracle this holy week : pope francis granted their son 's wish with a papal kiss . peter lombardi , 12 , was only 9 when he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in april 2015 . his devoutly catholic family had been set to see the pope in philadelphia that september when they found themselves in a hospital as peter began chemotherapy . as the family watched the papal visit from his hospital room , someone from make-a-wish came in asking for peter 's wish .

theories given for the success of southerners on idol have been : more versatility with musical genres , as the southern u.s. is home to several music genre scenes ; not having as many opportunities to break into the pop music business ; text-voting due to the south having the highest percentage of cell-phone only households ; and the strong heritage of music and singing , which is notable in the bible belt , where it is in church that many people get their start in public singing . others also suggest that the southern character of these contestants appeal to the south , as well as local pride . according to fifth season winner taylor hicks , who is from the state of alabama , `` people in the south have a lot of pride ... so , they 're adamant about supporting the contestants who do well from their state or region .

the big bang theory is an american comedy television series created and executively produced by chuck lorre and bill prady . like the name of the series itself -lrb- with the exception of the first episode `` pilot '' -rrb- , episode titles of the big bang theory always start with `` the '' and resemble the name of a scientific principle , theory or experiment , whimsically referencing a plot point or quirk in that episode . in season nine of the big bang theory , sheldon calls her to tell her that amy broke up with him and that he would like to send the family heirloom engagement ring back , but she advises him to hold on to it , just in case . she reappears in the season finale `` the convergence-convergence '' where she comes to attend leonard and penny 's re-wedding where she is not at all happy to see beverly . she meets leonard 's father alfred hofstadter and the two get along great as they have each other 's nice , gentle , and caring personalities , bonding over their mutual dislike of beverly , and their admiration of each other 's beliefs . the two of them end up fighting with beverly at the restaurant during the pre-ceremony dinner and the two leave together and after finding out they are staying at the same hotel , they decide to share a cab and it is implied that the two hook up . penny is a fictional character on the american cbs sitcom the big bang theory , portrayed by actress kaley cuoco . she is the primary female character in the series , befriending her across-the-hall neighbors leonard hofstadter -lrb- johnny galecki -rrb- and sheldon cooper -lrb- jim parsons -rrb- , two physicists who work at the nearby california institute of technology -lrb- caltech -rrb- . penny 's lack of advanced education , but outgoing personality and social aptitude drastically contrasts with the personalities of the primary male characters in the series , even though she is considered part of their group . she is the love interest of leonard , with whom she maintains a brief romantic relationship during the third season , which is later resumed in the fifth season and culminates in an engagement at the end of the seventh season and their wedding at the start of season 9 .
although clinton was the 25th woman to run for u.s. president , she was the first female candidate to have held a highly probable chance of winning the nomination of a major party , and the presidential election . she was also the first woman to be an american presidential candidate in every primary and caucus in every state . as such , remarks surrounding her gender and appearance came to the fore . in march 2006 , actress sharon stone expressed her doubt about clinton 's presidential chances , saying `` hillary still has sexual power , and i do n't think people will accept that . hillary clinton 's triumphant victory speech tuesday night sent a clear message to donald trump : bring it on . the former secretary of state emerged from `` super tuesday 3 '' with at least four key victories in ohio , illinois , florida and north carolina and roughly 300 more delegates than her democratic rival , bernie sanders . in missouri , clinton has a narrow lead over her rival , though the race is still too close to call . who won missouri ? the 2008 presidential campaign of hillary rodham clinton , then junior united states senator from new york , was announced on her website on january 20 , 2007 . hillary clinton was previously the first lady of the united states and first lady of arkansas prior to her election as u.s. senator from new york . she is also the wife of former president bill clinton .
abc news issued a statement , asserting : `` at the time , not all of our reporting met our standards to air , but we have never stopped investigating the story . ever since , we 've had a team on this investigation and substantial resources dedicated to it . that work has led to a two-hour documentary and 6-part podcast that will air in the new year . '' a version of this article first appeared in the `` reliable sources '' newsletter . you can sign up for free right here . if you found yourself online this weekend , you know what a terrible place it was . jeffrey epstein 's death unleashed a torrent of conspiracy theories online , some of which were propagated by individuals with sizable platforms and influence , including the president of the united states . on tuesday afternoon , president donald trump was asked whether he really believed -- per a tweet he retweeted on sunday -- that the clintons were somehow behind the death of billionaire financier and accused sexual predator jeffrey epstein . here 's how he responded : `` i have no idea . i know he was on his plane 27 times , and he said he was on the plane four times . but when they checked the plane logs , bill clinton , who was a very good friend of epstein , he was on the plane about 27 or 28 times , so why did he say four times ?
the french government has backed down over apparent plans to pay tribute to marshal philippe pétain -- who collaborated with the nazis in the deportation of jews from france during world war ii -- as part of commemorations to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of world war i. french president emmanuel macron came under fire wednesday after he said it was `` legitimate '' to honor pétain 's role as a `` great soldier '' in world war i. hours later , french government spokesman benjamin griveaux said in a facebook post that no tribute would be paid to pétain in saturday 's ceremony . `` we had announced that we would honor the marshals of the great war . some have deduced that pétain was one of them ; this is not the case . ron freer is 103 years old . he is blind and uses a wheelchair . ron lost his sight 75 years ago in the service of his country -- and the allied powers , which include britain , france and the united states -- due to the malnutrition he endured in a japanese prisoner of war camp during world war ii . he spent four years in the camp after the fall of the british military base at fort stanley . military museums across the united states and around the world often offer visitors glimpses of world wars , commemorating the men and women who sacrificed their lives for their country . the national veterans memorial and museum has a broader goal : to represent veterans -- not just war . war stories are present , of course , but they are n't primary . instead , there 's attention given to the decision to serve , training and boot camp , the sacred oath , deployment and personnel roles , separation from friends and family , survival , sacrifice and homecoming .
on tuesday night , us president donald trump revealed his nominee for the supreme court . neil gorsuch , a 49-year-old federal appellate judge from colorado , is trump 's pick to replace conservative justice antonin scalia , who died suddenly last year . gorsuch will likely face a blistering confirmation battle as senate democrats prepare to potentially filibuster trump 's nomination in the wake of successful republican obstruction of president obama 's nominee last year . while the supreme court usually rules on domestic issues of national importance , some cases -- such as the 2000 bush v. gore decision on the rightful winner of the us election -- can have huge international ramifications . president donald trump will nominate judge neil gorsuch to the supreme court , trump announced tuesday night at the white house . the nomination of gorsuch , a 49-year-old federal appellate judge from colorado , gives trump and republicans the opportunity to confirm someone who could cement the conservative direction of the court for decades . meet neil gorsuch : a fly-fishing scalia fan his selection also sets up an intense fight with senate democrats , still angry over the republicans ' decision to essentially ignore former president barack obama 's nomination of judge merrick garland for the empty supreme court seat last year . introducing gorsuch , trump said he had committed as a candidate to `` find the very best judge in the country for the supreme court . '' the appointment and confirmation of justices to the supreme court of the united states involves several steps set forth by the united states constitution , which have been further refined and developed by decades of tradition . candidates are nominated by the president of the united states and must face a series of hearings in which both the nominee and other witnesses make statements and answer questions before the senate judiciary committee , which can vote to send the nomination to the full united states senate . confirmation by the senate allows the president to formally appoint the candidate to the court . the constitution does not set any qualifications for service as a justice , thus the president may nominate any individual to serve on the court .
cheetos ' original mascot was the cheetos mouse , who debuted in 1971 and disappeared around 1979 . in 1986 , chester cheetah was created by brad morgan , who art directed the commercials and designed the character , and stephen kane who wrote the original scripts for television commercials . the original 24-frame animation was done by richard williams . after chester 's introduction , the sly , smooth voiced cheetah began starring in more commercials and eventually became cheetos ' official mascot . chester 's character underwent slight revamping in 1997 . with the introduction of the `` dangerously cheesy ! '' slogan and pete stacker replacing joel murray as his voice actor , chester began appearing in live-action/animated hybrid advertisements that saw him entering the real world . during this time , the ads began portraying him in a less antagonistic manner ; his personality went from being bumbling to being suaver and cooler , as well as him actually managing to eat cheetos unlike in the older commercials . in 1992 , chester 's own television program called yo ! it 's the chester cheetah show ! was under development for the fox kids saturday morning fall lineup ; however , an ethics debate erupted over chester 's status as an advertising character , and likely due to the protests of action for children 's television , the show was prevented from airing . their petition marked the first time that the organization protested something before it actually became a program .
he had more faith in me than i did myself . now i 'm glad i listened , for it is a challenging role and a very demanding one . i start out as a young wife , and age through various periods , forcing me to adjust psychologically to each age . it is a complete departure for me , and most intriguing . the gardner-sinatra marriage was tumultuous . gardner confided to artie shaw , her second husband , that , `` with him , it 's impossible ... it 's like being with a woman . he 's so gentle . gardner , who had raced during an era when safety was n't a big concern for the drivers and where many of his fellow drivers -lrb- including a number of close friends such as world champion jim clark -rrb- were killed in racing accidents , had always maintained that he did n't care if he was n't the fastest driver , he just wanted to be the oldest . he died in his home at mermaid waters in queensland on 29 august 2009 at the age of 78 following a long battle with illness associated with his racing and engineering career .
the town was `` dry '' , meaning no alcohol could be sold within the city limits , for a good part of its early history . newberg was one of the first communities in oregon to hold quaker services . it was incorporated as a city in 1889 . the city 's oldest surviving newspaper , the newberg graphic , was established dec. 1 , 1888 . friends pacific academy , renamed pacific college in 1891 and then george fox university in 1949 , was founded by the quakers in 1885 . herbert hoover moved to the city in 1885 , to live with his uncle and aunt after the death of his parents and was one of the first students to attend his uncle 's pacific academy the home has been turned into the hoover-minthorn house museum .
in the early 1970s , craig hassell , a transplanted long island lacrosse fanatic , stepped up and kept the tradition alive . the 70 's rosters were packed with the types of free spirited players that typified the era . predominately from long island and maryland , these free spirits had little cares other than their dedication to the game . in 1976 , the timing was right for yet another transplanted long islander to assume the responsibility for the stability of the university of arizona program . the tradition of the territorial cup goes all the way back to 1899 , the year the university of arizona first fielded a football team . in 2009 , arizona schools began competing in the territorial cup series . it 's a yearlong competition that includes multiple sports . the territorial cup trophy was n't shared between the two rival universities , arizona state university and university of arizona , until 2001 . after the passage of the morrill land-grant act of 1862 , the push for a university in arizona grew . the arizona territory 's `` thieving thirteenth '' legislature approved the university of arizona in 1885 and selected the city of tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university . tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory 's mental hospital , which carried a $ 100,000 allocation instead of the $ 25,000 allotted to the territory 's only university -lrb- arizona state university was also chartered in 1885 , but it was created as arizona 's normal school , and not a university -rrb- . flooding on the salt river delayed tucson 's legislators , and by they time they reached prescott , back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made .
in april 1860 , grant and his family moved north to galena , accepting a position in his father 's leather goods business run by his younger brothers simpson and orvil . in a few months , grant paid off his debts . the family attended the local methodist church and he soon established himself as a reputable citizen of galena . for the 1860 election , he could not vote because he was not yet a legal resident of illinois , but he favored democrat stephen a. douglas over the eventual winner , abraham lincoln , and lincoln over the southern democrat , john c. breckinridge . owing to the delay in determining the cause of death , michael 's funeral was held 29 march 2017 . in a private ceremony , he was buried at highgate cemetery in north london , near his mother 's grave . that summer an informal memorial garden was created outside his former home in highgate . the site , in a private square that michael had owned , is tended by fans . on april 14 , 1865 , five days after grant 's victory at appomattox , he attended a cabinet meeting in washington . lincoln invited him and his wife to ford 's theater , but they declined as upon his wife julia 's urging , had plans to travel to philadelphia . in a conspiracy that also targeted top cabinet members in one last effort to topple the union , lincoln was fatally shot by john wilkes booth at the theater , and died the next morning . many , including grant himself , thought that he had been a target in the plot and during the subsequent trial , the government tried to prove that grant had been stalked by booth 's conspirator michael o'laughlen .

a few days after the fifth anniversary of euromaidan -- the wave of demonstrations that kicked off in ukraine in november 2013 -- vessels belonging to the russian coast guard opened fire against three ukrainian navy ships , according to ukraine 's military , that were trying to pass through the strait of kerch . ukraine said the firefight ended with six of its servicemen wounded and russian special operations forces capturing the vessels , along with their crews of 23 . the captured ships and crews were then transported to a nearby russian base . the clash presents a dangerous new escalation in a conflict that has caused thousands of casualties and deaths since the 2014 illegal annexation of crimea by russia and the subsequent fighting that erupted in eastern ukraine . the ukrainian military said sunday that russian boats opened fire on and seized three of its ships near crimea , escalating a standoff over the kerch strait , a key waterway that holds strategic importance for both countries . the incident marks a major escalation in tensions between the two former soviet republics . on monday , ukrainian lawmakers will vote on whether to declare martial law , following a proposal by the country 's president petro poroshenko . an emergency united nations security council meeting has been called for monday to discuss the issue . putin condemned the west 's reaction to the events in the crimea and sanctions against russian and ukrainian politicians . russian president expressed gratitude to the people of china , praised the restraint of india . appealed to the u.s. freedom-loving people , stressing that freedom of the crimean population is the same value . referring to the fact that not all allies sympathized with germany in 1989 , it merged with the german democratic republic , putin said that while the ussr supported the germans sincere desire for national unity .

olay 's marketing was also unique , since it was never described as a moisturizer , nor even as beauty fluid . nowhere on the packaging did it say what the product actually did . print advertisements used copy such as `` share the secret of a younger looking you '' and talked about the `` beauty secret '' of oil of olay . other advertisements were written as personal messages to the reader from a fictitious advice columnist named margaret merril . in august 2016 , olay launched a new innovative tool called the skin advisor , designed to help consumers find the right product for their exact skin type . after uploading a selfie and answering some skin care questions , the skin advisor will analyze your skin , tell you your skin age and provide product recommendations for any problem areas . the olay brand has expanded into a range of other products grouped into `` boutiques '' including complete , total effects , prox , regenerist , regenerist luminous , classics , fresh effects , body -lrb- north america -rrb- and white radiance -lrb- asia -rrb- . olay is the market leader in many countries including the us , uk , and china . olay has extended its heritage as a moisturizer to stay looking young , to formally creating the `` anti-aging '' category in mass stores with the launch of total effects in 1999 . active hydrating formula , generally the least expensive variety , bears the closest resemblance to the pink `` oil of olay '' marketed in the us before the p&g acquisition .
the impact of hurricane sandy on the lives of residents of the northeast will be great . millions are without power , likely for an extended period of time . businesses -- from the nation 's stock exchanges and all the way on down to thousands of corner stores -- have been shut down . the total cost of property damage and lost business is estimated to run between $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion , according to eqecat , which provides loss estimates to the insurance industry . no one hopes hurricane sandy lives up to its potential . the storm that has already claimed nearly two dozen lives in the caribbean churned friday near the northern bahamas , and meteorologists warn that it packs the potential to slam the u.s. northeast as soon as monday with powerful winds and pelting rain . worst case , sandy could merge with a strong cold front from the west . the double threat could morph into a `` superstorm '' that could sit over new england for days , making untold trouble for millions of residents . gas prices are likely to spike in the days after hurricane sandy rips through the northeast , but they should drop back down before too long . the largest atlantic storm ever recorded is making its way through the heart of the east coast 's oil refinery region . sandy 's fierce winds and unrelenting rain will be pounding major refineries in delaware , new jersey and pennsylvania . many have already shut down temporarily .

president donald trump intends to nominate acting defense secretary patrick shanahan to be his permanent pick to replace james mattis at the pentagon , according to a tweet from white house press secretary sarah sanders . `` based upon his outstanding service to the country and his demonstrated ability to lead , president trump intends to nominate patrick m. shanahan to be the secretary of defense , '' sanders said in a statement . shortly after the announcement , shanahan issued a statement saying he was `` honored '' to be chosen as the pentagon 's permanent head . the former boeing executive said in comments to reporters after the announcement that he had been informed of the decision earlier thursday . wednesday marks the first anniversary of the trump administration 's decision to pick up its marbles and exit the iran nuclear accord , otherwise known as the joint comprehensive plan of action , or jcpoa . the sky has n't fallen . but tensions are mounting ; iran has not yet bolted from the agreement or resumed its nuclear enrichment , but reports suggest tehran may well stop abiding by some provisions in the jcpoa , particularly on research on advanced centrifuges , as payback against us sanctions . the two countries are n't yet at war , though the trump administration 's deployment of a carrier strike group this week , in an apparent reaction to intelligence on the movements of iran-aligned groups -lrb- as administration officials told the new york times -rrb- , is a worrisome sign . president donald trump has become irritated at an emerging impression his hawkish national security advisers are marching him closer to war with iran despite his isolationist tendencies , according to people familiar with the matter . instead , trump is signaling his intent to speak with the iranians as tensions rise in the persian gulf , and his national security team has taken steps they hope could facilitate a new diplomatic opening . the likelihood of such an opening appears slim . but trump has raised concern with the heightened rhetoric , believing a large-scale military intervention with iran would be devastating to him politically , people familiar with the situation said .

according to the new york times , the change was made in the hopes that msnbc can win a wider audience than it did with schultz . hayes was said to transition better to the rachel maddow show because he is seen as just as policy-oriented as maddow . `` chris has done an amazing job creating a franchise on weekend mornings , '' said phil griffin , the president of msnbc . `` he 's an extraordinary talent and has made a strong connection with our audience .

'' santorum 's view was at odds with that of bill wasik , senior editor of wired magazine : `` yet looking back on the seamus romney story today , what is most striking is its forgettability , how indistinguishable it seems in retrospect from the idiots ' parade of meaningless stories that came to define the campaign . '' he considered voting for the libertarian ticket of former republican governors gary johnson and bill weld , saying that he would `` get to know gary johnson better and see if he 's someone who i could end up voting for '' , adding that `` if bill weld were at the top of the ticket , it would be very easy for me to vote for bill weld for president . '' in september he called for johnson to be included in the presidential debates and in october it emerged that independent candidate evan mcmullin was using an email list of 2.5 million romney supporters to raise money . mcmullin 's chief strategist said that it was purchased from romney for president and that `` we 'll let other folks discuss what that may mean and certainly never speak for '' . a spokeswoman for romney said that the list had been `` rented by several political candidates in the presidential primary , and by countless other political and commercial users in the time since the 2012 campaign '' and romney made no public comment on mcmullin 's candidacy . romney himself thought he might be branded a `` loser for life '' and fade into an obscurity like michael dukakis -lrb- a similar figure with no obvious base of political support who had lost what his party considered a winnable presidential election -rrb- but , to the surprise of many political observers , that did not happen . romney re-emerged onto the political scene in the run-up to the 2014 u.s. midterm elections , endorsing , campaigning , and fundraising for a number of republican candidates , especially those running for the u.s. senate .

al-qaeda operates as a network of islamic extremists and salafist jihadists . the organization has been designated as a terrorist group by the united nations security council , the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- , the european union , the united states , the united kingdom , russia , india , and various other countries -lrb- see below -rrb- . al-qaeda has mounted attacks on non-military and military targets in various countries , including the 1998 united states embassy bombings , the september 11 attacks , and the 2002 bali bombings . according to the times , in 2010 the united states , in cooperation with yemeni officials , launched four cruise missiles at suspected terrorist targets in yemen . according to the times , yemen asked the united states to suspend the strikes after one of the missiles killed a pro-yemeni tribal leader , sheikh jaber al-shabwani , the deputy governor of marib province , resulting in his tribe turning against the yemeni government . the times also stated that u.s. special forces troops were on the ground in yemen helping to hunt al-qaeda operatives . on august 1 , 2008 , cbs news reported that it had obtained a copy of an intercepted letter dated july 29 , 2008 , from unnamed sources in pakistan , which urgently requested a doctor to treat al-zawahiri . the letter indicated that al-zawahiri was critically injured in a us missile strike at azam warsak village in south waziristan on july 28 that also reportedly killed al qaeda explosives expert abu khabab al-masri . taliban mehsud spokesman maulvi umar told the associated press on august 2 , 2008 , that the report of al-zawahiri 's injury was false .
the digital sounds of the 2000s also reportedly inspired simon . `` i wondered , ` is this an appropriate context to express various thoughts , given the way people listen now and the way music is exposed to the world ? ' pop music , as it 's constantly evolving , is completely different from the value system and aesthetic i grew up with and contributed to . '' simon stated that he was n't demonizing technological shifts . simon 's ex-wife carrie fisher said in her autobiography wishful drinking that the song `` she moves on '' is about her . it 's one of several she claimed , followed by the line , `` if you can get paul simon to write a song about you , do it . because he is so brilliant at it . '' simon showed special care about the musical venture he traveled since 1986 's graceland . as he put it , `` once you go away for a bit , you wonder who people think you are . if they do n't know what you 're up to , they just go by your history . i 'm so often described as this person that went to other cultures , which is true , but i never thought of it that way .
the united states house of representatives is the lower house of the united states congress , the senate being the upper house . together they compose the national legislature of the united states . the composition of the house is established by article one of the united states constitution . the house is composed of representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the u.s. census , with each district entitled to one representative . the house of representatives is modeled after the united states house of representatives ; the two chambers of congress have roughly equal powers , and every bill or resolution that has to go through both houses needs the consent of both chambers before being passed for the president 's signature . once a bill is defeated in the house of representatives , it is lost . once a bill is approved by the house of representatives on third reading , the bill is passed to the senate , unless an identical bill has also been passed by the lower house . when a counterpart bill in the senate is different from the one passed by the house of representatives , either a bicameral conference committee is created consisting of members from both chambers of congress to reconcile the differences , or either chamber may instead approve the other chamber 's version . the house of representatives is the lower house of the bicameral parliament of australia , the upper house being the senate . its composition and powers are established in chapter i of the constitution of australia .
prior to 1974 , congress had no formal process for establishing a federal budget . when president richard nixon began to refuse to spend funds that congress had allocated , they adopted a more formal means by which to challenge him . the congressional budget act of 1974 created the congressional budget office -lrb- cbo -rrb- , which gained more control of the budget , limiting the power of the president 's office of management and budget -lrb- omb -rrb- . the act passed easily while the administration was embroiled in the watergate scandal and was unwilling to provoke congress . bush and congressional leaders agreed to avoid major changes to the budget for fiscal year 1990 , which began in october 1989 . however , both sides knew that spending cuts or new taxes would be necessary in the following year 's budget in order to avoid the draconian automatic domestic spending cuts required by the gramm -- rudman -- hollings balanced budget act of 1987 . bush and other leaders also wanted to cut deficits because federal reserve chair alan greenspan refused to lower interest rates , and thus stimulate economic growth , unless the federal budget deficit was reduced . in a statement released in late june 1990 , bush said that he would be open to a deficit reduction program which included spending cuts , incentives for economic growth , budget process reform , as well as tax increases . in september 1990 , bush and congressional democrats announced a compromise to cut funding for mandatory and discretionary programs while also raising revenue , partly through a higher gas tax . the compromise additionally included a `` pay as you go '' provision that required that new programs be paid for at the time of implementation . though he had previously promised to support the bill , house minority whip newt gingrich led the conservative opposition to the bill . liberals also criticized the budget cuts in the compromise , and in october , the house rejected the deal , resulting in a brief government shutdown .
regarding her long-term goals , tate said , `` becoming a champion means more to me than anything -- more than a rematch , more than anything . that 's something that when i 'm 80 years old someday and i have kids and grandkids i can look back and say , ` look , this is what i did . this is my accomplishment . ' so that 's my ultimate goal . '' in interviews during production , tate expressed an affinity for her character , jennifer north , an aspiring actress admired only for her body . some magazines commented that tate was viewed similarly and look published an unfavorable article about the three lead actresses , describing tate as `` a hopelessly stupid and vain starlet '' . tate , duke , and parkins developed a close friendship that continued after the completion of the film . during the shooting of valley of the dolls , tate confided to parkins that she was `` madly in love '' with polanski . later in the year , valley of the dolls opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . bosley crowther wrote in the new york times , `` all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away '' . newsweek said that the film `` has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure '' , but a later article read : `` astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , sharon tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit hollywood in a long time . '' the three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including the saturday review , which wrote , `` ten years ago ... parkins , duke , and tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . ''
a term of congress is divided into two `` sessions '' , one for each year ; congress has occasionally been called into an extra or special session . a new session commences on january 3 each year , unless congress decides differently . the constitution requires congress meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the capitol without the consent of the other house . representatives introduce a bill while the house is in session by placing it in the hopper on the clerk 's desk . it is assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage . drafting statutes requires `` great skill , knowledge , and experience '' and sometimes take a year or more . sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction . a bill which reaches the floor of the full house can be simple or complex and begins with an enacting formula such as `` be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled . '' consideration of a bill requires , itself , a rule which is a simple resolution specifying the particulars of debate -- time limits , possibility of further amendments , and such . each side has equal time and members can yield to other members who wish to speak . sometimes opponents seek to recommit a bill which means to change part of it .
house speaker john boehner realized that managing the massive crowd descending on the capitol grounds for pope francis ' visit will require a small army -- so he created one . when francis makes the first papal visit to congress next thursday , this mini-army -- the first-ever volunteer force of over 100 house and senate aides -- will provide far more help than the ordinary mix of security , administrative and events staff that typically coordinate a visit from a world later . the `` special events reps '' will wear green , boehner 's favorite color and the liturgical color of this season in the catholic church , and serve as the face of congress , guiding visitors to spots to view the speech , answering questions about etiquette , and supporting security personnel . at a time when republicans and democrats are at loggerheads over virtually everything -- the federal government could close at the end of the month unless the parties reach an agreement -- the pope 's visit is one of the rare occasions where adversaries on capitol hill are coming together . pope francis landed on u.s. soil for the first time tuesday evening . on wednesday , the pope will hold his first public events in washington . here are five things to watch on this historic day . 1 . climate change , cuba and poverty are the issues the white house expects to top the agenda when president barack obama welcomes pope francis on wednesday . but beyond hot-button political topics , a senior white house official said the two men enjoy a rapport that means many different subjects could be raised , should the pope be so inclined . `` the president values hearing from the pope on a number of issues that they both care about , '' the official said . `` we expect that the pope will feel very comfortable bringing up any issues on his mind . ''
former employees , current employees , the media , and politicians have criticized amazon for poor working conditions at the company . in 2011 , it was publicized that workers had to carry out tasks in 100 °f -lrb- 38 °c -rrb- heat at the breinigsville , pennsylvania warehouse . as a result of these inhumane conditions , employees became extremely uncomfortable and suffered from dehydration and collapse . loading-bay doors were not opened to allow in fresh air because of concerns over theft . when amazon first introduced its virtual assistant in 2014 , it was hard to imagine that , several years later , you 'd have to be careful where you utter the name `` alexa . '' amazon wants to keep a commanding presence in the fast-growing virtual assistant space . on wednesday , at a press event at its seattle headquarters , the company is expected to announce new products and services that will help it maintain its position as the market leader . these are likely to include a wide range of alexa-infused products for different places in the home and at different prices , as well as updates to alexa 's functions . a 2015 front-page article in the new york times profiled several former amazon employees who together described a `` bruising '' workplace culture in which workers with illness or other personal crises were pushed out or unfairly evaluated . bezos responded by writing a sunday memo to employees , in which he disputed the times 's account of `` shockingly callous management practices '' that he said would never be tolerated at the company .
reed became a close friend and drinking partner of the who 's drummer keith moon in 1974 while working together on the film version of tommy . with their reckless lifestyles reed and moon had much in common , and both cited the hard-drinking actor robert newton as a role model . sir christopher lee , a friend and colleague of reed , commented on his alcoholism in 2014 : `` when he started , after number eight , he became a complete monster . it was awful to see . '' robert reed -lrb- born john robert rietz jr. ; october 19 , 1932 -- may 12 , 1992 -rrb- was an american actor . he played kenneth preston on the legal drama the defenders from 1961 to 1965 alongside e. g. marshall , and is best known for his role as the father mike brady , opposite florence henderson 's role as carol brady , on the abc sitcom the brady bunch , which aired from 1969 to 1974 . he later reprised his role of mike brady on several of the reunion programs . in 1976 , he earned two primetime emmy award nominations for his guest-starring role in a two-part episode of medical center and for his work on the miniseries rich man , poor man . the actor omid djalili , who was also in malta at the time of reed 's death filming gladiator , said during an interview in 2016 : `` he had n't had a drink for months before filming started ... everyone said he went the way he wanted ... sober , but that 's not true . it was very tragic . he was in an irish bar and was pressured into a drinking competition . he should have just left , but he did n't .

american pharoah is the first triple crown winner in 37 years , but his biggest payday wo n't be on a race track . the big money will come from the stud fees he 'll earn once his racing days are over . the horse 's owners , zayat stables , sold his breeding rights on may 20 for an undisclosed amount , just four days after he won the preakness and became a contender for the triple crown . justin zayat , racing manager for zayat stables , told espn that they had passed on an offer `` north of $ 20 million '' for the breeding rights . jockey victor espinoza has been here before . twice , in fact . and horse trainer bob baffert has been here before , too . thrice , to be exact . north america is a continent entirely within the northern hemisphere and almost all within the western hemisphere . it is also considered by some to be a northern subcontinent of the americas . it is bordered to the north by the arctic ocean , to the east by the atlantic ocean , to the west and south by the pacific ocean , and to the southeast by south america and the caribbean sea . north america covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers -lrb- 9,540,000 square miles -rrb- , about 16.5 % of the earth 's land area and about 4.8 % of its total surface .
ted cruz started the month riding high in iowa . now , he just wants to get out of the state alive . the self-styled rock-ribbed conservative is under siege , battling attacks from his right and left flanks who say the texas senator with tea party and evangelical credentials is n't who he claims to be . and as cruz appears to be falling farther behind front-runner donald trump , his campaign is now looking in the rear-view mirror , concerned that marco rubio and the rest of the gop field are closing in . the biggest elephant was n't in the room -- so ted cruz stood center stage , taking punches from his opponents and the moderators . but how much did this matter ? the fox news debate thursday night exposed few new rifts between the contenders and featured candidates mostly sticking to message . donald trump was elsewhere , and here 's what he missed : it 's time to vote . marco rubio 's complicated path to the gop nomination comes down to this : attrition . the floridian is betting that the race will eventually turn into a one-on-one slugfest between him and donald trump -- and that the party will coalesce behind him as other establishment-backed candidates drop out , according to interviews with donors , advisers and allies of rubio . but unlike jeb bush , rubio is in no hurry to engage the donald -- at least not yet . he 's betting ted cruz , who has staked much of his campaign on winning in iowa , will lose to trump next week here in the caucuses , seriously blunting the texas republican 's momentum in the rest of february 's primaries and undermining his candidacy .
over the last year , researchers have found nearby exoplanets that could potentially support life , like proxima b and the seven trappist-1 planets . now , a `` super-earth '' has been found 39 light-years away , according to new research in the journal nature . researchers believe it may be one of the best candidates for a closer look in the future by the james webb space telescope , which nasa will launch in 2018 . lhs 1140b , named for the small , faint red dwarf star it orbits , has all the right features . a large asteroid is whizzing by earth this week , and nasa has the images to prove it . the space rock , known by the very dull name of 2014 jo25 , was expected to safely fly by earth on wednesday night , according to nasa . radar images obtained by nasa a day earlier show a peanut-shaped asteroid that rotates about once every five hours . `` although there is no possibility for the asteroid to collide with our planet , this will be a very close approach for an asteroid of this size , '' the space agency said in a statement . nasa announced this week exciting results from a spacecraft observing saturn 's moon enceladus and jupiter 's moon europa . equipment on the cassini probe detected some of the required conditions and building blocks for life on both moons . for those like myself , who thrill at any discovery that suggests earth 's creatures may not be alone in the universe , the findings capture our imagination anew . but does cassini bring our imaginings closer to reality ?
the british foreign and commonwealth office speaks of vatican city as the `` capital '' of the holy see , although it compares the legal personality of the holy see to that of the crown in christian monarchies and declares that the holy see and the state of vatican city are two international identities . it also distinguishes between the employees of the holy see -lrb- 2,750 working in the roman curia with another 333 working in the holy see 's diplomatic missions abroad -rrb- and the 1,909 employees of the vatican city state . the british ambassador to the holy see uses more precise language , saying that the holy see `` is not the same as the vatican city state . ... -lrb- it -rrb- is the universal government of the catholic church and operates from the vatican city state . '' although the holy see is sometimes metonymically referred to as the `` vatican '' , the vatican city state was distinctively established with the lateran treaty of 1929 , between the holy see and italy , to ensure the temporal , diplomatic , and spiritual independence of the papacy . as such , papal nuncios , who are papal diplomats to states and international organizations , are recognized as representing the holy see not the vatican city state , as prescribed in the canon law of the catholic church ; and therefore the integrity of the catholic church along with its 1.3 billion members . the holy see is thus viewed as the central government of the catholic church . the catholic church , in turn , is the largest non-government provider of education and health care in the world . on june 14 , 2006 , pope benedict xvi urged israelis and palestinians in his weekly general audience to return to negotiation after the `` increasingly blind '' tit-for-tat violence . the vatican said in a statement that the pope felt close to the innocent victims of such violence and that the holy land had become `` hostage to those who delude themselves they can solve the ever more dramatic problems of the region by force or unilateral action '' . the vatican appealed to both sides `` to show due respect for human life , especially that of unarmed civilians and children '' . in its statement , the vatican urged the resumption `` with courage of the path of negotiations , the only one that can lead to the just and lasting peace we all aspire to .

in 1997 , crayola released crayons with glitter as part of a special effects crayons package . starting as late as 1999 , their crayon names do n't appear on the crayon wrappers . in the below list , the background represents crayon color , and the highlighted `` square of glitter '' around text represents glitter color . in 1997 , crayola released a 16-pack of pearl brite crayons : these were designed to give soft pearlescent colors . these had a new wrapper design , black with a white oval crayola logo and white text . the 1970s saw the introduction of crayola 's first specialty crayons , eight fluorescent colors designed to glow under black light . these were never added to the no. 64 box , but were available separately or in a special box of 72 crayons , typically packaged with activity books or crayon stands . fabric crayons were introduced in 1980 , as the crayola brand continued to expand beyond regular drawing crayons .
in 2005 , institute senior fellows peter huber and mark mills released the book the bottomless well , which disputes several popular beliefs about energy . bill gates described it as `` the only book i 've seen that really explains energy , its history , and what it will be like going forward '' . published amid concern about `` peak oil '' , the book points out that expanding energy supplies mean higher productivity , more jobs , and a growing gdp . mills has written extensively on the geopolitical opportunities presented by the american energy sector . the economist reported in february 2020 that strong nominal wage gains experienced by lower-paid workers in 2019 may be due in part to restrictions on immigration , along with the low unemployment rate giving workers more bargaining power , and significant increases in state-level minimum wages over several years . however , nominal wages are increasing in many rich countries , even those with growing foreign-born populations . further , the article cautioned : `` as america ages , it will need a lot more people willing to work in health care . study after study finds a positive association between immigration and long-run economic growth -- and therefore , ultimately , the living standards of all americans . given the concern about economic inequality among mainstream academics and commentators , especially since the great recession and the release of thomas piketty 's bestselling capital in the twenty-first century , the institute has produced several pieces of research on this and the related issue of economic mobility in the u.s. . in 2014 , former senior fellow scott winship produced a report , `` inequality does not reduce prosperity '' , which examined evidence from across the globe . this report concluded that larger increases in inequality correspond with sharper rises in living standards for the middle class and poor alike , while greater inequality in developed nations tends to accompany stronger economic growth . in a 2015 report , winship examined the state of economic and residential mobility in the u.s. , finding that people who move from their birth states fare better economically than those who stay put .
donald trump has never faced more pressure on the national stage than he will thursday evening when he accepts the republican nomination . this week 's republican national convention has been dominated by unexpected fireworks ranging from the plagiarized speech his wife delivered and the way the campaign prolonged the episode to ted cruz 's shocking address wednesday in which he refused to endorse trump and encouraged americans to vote their conscience . cruz 's speech exposed the deep divisions that remain in the party after the fractious primary . but beyond the cleveland drama , trump faces a more difficult long-term challenge : fashioning a message that can at once soothe concerns among scores of independent women while still firing up the white men who are angry about the direction of the country . jeb bush is carrying his crusade against donald trump to the doorstep of the republican convention , saying that he is not the future of the republican party even as it prepares to nominate him . bush , once seen as the front-runner for the republican presidential nomination , remains one of the most prominent anti-trump holdouts in the gop . in an op-ed for the washington post published friday , bush acknowledged that trump had capitalized on legitimate frustrations with american politics . `` they have given rise to the success of a candidate who continues to grotesquely manipulate the deeply felt anger of many americans , '' bush wrote , saying the nominee harkened back to an 1850s political party . donald trump , the billionaire businessman whose outsider campaign has both galvanized millions of voters and divided the republican party , is the 2016 gop presidential nominee . the new yorker 's embrace by the republican national convention marks a remarkable moment in u.s. political history and validates a campaign that shattered precedent , defied pundits and usurped the gop establishment . his son donald trump , jr. , cast the votes for the new york delegation that put the billionaire businessman over the top of the 1,237 delegates he needed to clinch the nomination , as any talk of disruptive protest votes or walkouts dissipated . `` it is my honor to be able to throw donald trump over the top in the delegate count tonight with 89 delegates , '' donald jr. said , surrounded by three of trump 's other children -- ivanka , eric and tiffany .

after romney left the race in february , leaving john mccain strongly favored to win the nomination , paul e-mailed his supporters on february 8 and stated that he was refactoring his presidential campaign to be `` leaner and tighter '' and would devote a significant portion of his time specifically to his campaign for reelection to the u.s. house , representing texas 's 14th congressional district , where paul is being challenged for the republican nomination by friendswood mayor pro tem chris peden . paul recognized a nearly zero chance of a brokered convention . he was determined to continue in every caucus and primary remaining and promised not to campaign for president for another party . staffer dan mccarthy clarified in a blog post on february 9 that paul 's presidential campaign `` is not ending , not being suspended , and not even drawing down '' , stating that '' few news sources are misreporting ron paul 's e-mail from last night . '' the same day , paul made a brief press statement : `` on the heels of his historic three-day rally in minneapolis that drew over 12,000 attendees , congressman ron paul will make a major announcement next week in washington at the national press club . '' the congressman had reportedly invited presidential candidates chuck baldwin , bob barr , cynthia mckinney , and ralph nader to the press conference , leading some to speculate that they would endorse paul running for president on the ticket of either the constitution , libertarian or other third party . beginning in 1978 , for more than two decades , ron paul -- american physician , libertarian activist , congressman , and presidential candidate -- published a variety of political and investment-oriented newsletters bearing his name . the content of some newsletters , which were widely deemed racist , was a source of controversy during his 1996 congressional campaign and his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns .
beginning in 2011 , the men 's and women 's rogers cup tournaments were held during the same week , doing away with the later tournament which was said to be too close to the us open . the corresponding rounds of the men 's and women 's matches are held on the same day , though a couple of hours apart to avoid broadcast conflicts . the event was played on clay until 1979 when it switched permanently to hard courts . both the men 's and women 's tournaments were played as a single combined tournament at the national tennis centre in toronto until 1981 , when the men 's tournament was played at the jarry park stadium in montreal for the first time . similarly 1982 was the first year in which the women 's tournament was played in montreal . in 1995 , andre agassi and pete sampras met in the final , the third of the four times that the two top-ranked men 's players would meet that year , after the australian open and indian wells masters . agassi 's tournament win helped him regain the number-one ranking , which he lost to sampras after they played each other again at the us open .
at the moment of impact , secretary of defense donald rumsfeld was in his office on the other side of the pentagon , away from the crash site . he ran to the site and assisted the injured . rumsfeld returned to his office , and went to a conference room in the executive support center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with vice president dick cheney and other officials . on the day of the attacks , dod officials considered moving their command operations to site r , a backup facility in pennsylvania . on november 1 , 2006 , bush stated he would stand by rumsfeld as defense secretary for the length of his term as president . rumsfeld wrote a resignation letter dated november 6 , and , per the stamp on the letter , bush saw it on election day , november 7 . in the elections , the house and the senate shifted to democratic control . after the elections , on november 8 , bush announced rumsfeld would resign his position as secretary of defense . cheney has said his time at the pentagon was the most rewarding period of his public service career , calling it `` the one that stands out . '' in 2014 , cheney recounted that when he met with president george h. w. bush to accept the offer , he passed a painting in the private residence entitled the peacemakers , which depicted president lincoln , general grant , and william tecumseh sherman . `` my great-grandfather had served under william tecumseh sherman throughout the war , '' cheney said , `` and it occurred to me as i was in the room as i walked in to talk to the president about becoming secretary of defense , i wondered what he would have thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the white house with the president talking about taking over the reins of the u.s. military .

duke 's research expenditures in the 2015 fiscal year were $ 1.037 billion , the seventh largest in the nation . in the 2013 fiscal year , duke university medical center received $ 270 million in funding from the national institutes of health -lrb- exclusive of contracts and economic stimulus program awards -rrb- . duke 's faculty is among the most productive in the nation . throughout the school 's history , duke researchers have made breakthroughs , including the biomedical engineering department 's development of the world 's first real-time , three-dimensional ultrasound diagnostic system and the first engineered blood vessels and stents . in the 2004 fiscal year , research expenditures surpassed $ 490 million , leading to a myriad of important breakthroughs . the duke global health research building , one of four laboratories in the u.s. attempting to `` develop new vaccines , drugs , and tests to fight infectious diseases for a duke-led consortium of universities , '' broke ground . also undergoing construction was the duke smart house , a 4,500-square-foot -lrb- 420 m2 -rrb- research center in which undergraduates explore resource-efficient design . in 2019 , duke paid $ 112.5 million to settle false claims act allegations related to scientific research misconduct . a researcher at the school was faking research in order to win grants and then pocketing the money , a whistle blower informed duke but appropriate action was not taken in a timely fashion . in response to the misconduct settlement , duke established an advisory panel of academics from caltech , stanford and rockefeller university . based on the recommendations of this panel , the duke office of scientific integrity -lrb- dosi -rrb- was established under the leadership of lawrence carin , an engineering professor who is one of the world 's leading experts on machine learning and artificial intelligence the establishment of this office brings duke 's research practices in line with those at peer institutions like johns hopkins university
andersen 's decision to change the ending may have occurred after he read the manuscript tale to a child , or its inspiration may have been one of andersen 's own childhood incidents which was similar to that in the tale : he once recalled standing in a crowd with his mother , waiting to see king frederick vi , and when the king made his appearance , andersen cried out , `` oh , he 's nothing more than a human being ! '' his mother then tried to silence him saying , `` have you gone mad , child ? '' whatever the reason , andersen thought the change would prove more satirical . ten years later , andersen visited england again , primarily to meet dickens . he extended a brief visit to dickens ' home at gads hill place into a five-week stay , to the distress of dickens ' family . after andersen was told to leave , dickens gradually stopped all correspondence between them , to the great disappointment and confusion of andersen , who had quite enjoyed the visit and never understood why his letters went unanswered . `` the emperor 's new clothes '' was first published with `` the little mermaid '' in copenhagen , by c. a. reitzel , on 7 april 1837 , as the third and final installment of andersen 's fairy tales told for children . the tale has been adapted to various media , and the story 's title , the phrase `` the emperor has no clothes '' , and variations thereof have been adopted for use in numerous other works and as an idiom .

the issue of capital punishment came up in the october 13 , 1988 , debate between the two presidential nominees . because she knew the willie horton issue would be brought up , dukakis 's campaign manager , susan estrich , had prepared with michael dukakis an answer highlighting the candidate 's empathy for victims of crime , noting the beating of his father in a robbery and the death of his brother in a hit-and-run . however , when bernard shaw , the moderator of the debate , asked dukakis , `` governor , if kitty dukakis were raped and murdered , would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer ? '' dukakis replied , `` no , i do n't , and i think you know that i 've opposed the death penalty during all of my life '' , and explained his stance . the 1988 presidential campaign of michael dukakis began when he announced his candidacy for the democratic party 's 1988 presidential nomination on march 16 , 1987 , in a speech in boston . after winning the nomination , he was formally crowned the democratic party 's nominee at the party 's convention in atlanta , georgia on july 21 , 1988 . he lost the 1988 election to his republican opponent george h. w. bush , who was the sitting vice president at the time . dukakis won 10 states and the district of columbia , receiving a total of 111 electoral votes compared to bush 's 426 -lrb- dukakis would have received 112 , but one faithless elector who was pledged to him voted for bentsen for president and dukakis for vice president instead out of protest -rrb- . dukakis had trouble with the personality that he projected to the voting public . his reserved and stoic nature was easily interpreted to be a lack of passion ; dukakis was often referred to as `` zorba the clerk '' . nevertheless , dukakis is considered to have done well in the first presidential debate with george bush , with the new york times reporting , `` democratic and republican analysts generally agreed that mr. dukakis had turned in the better performance in the first of two presidential debates , frequently managing to put mr. bush on the defensive . '' but in the second debate , his performance was poor and played to his reputation as being cold .

it can be said that the myriad doubts about the warren commission 's findings in the death of president kennedy represent a reverse situation . the doubts would never be taken seriously until they were inside the beltway , in the halls of congress , the courts and the white house . stevie wonder is boycotting , demonstrators are demanding and president barack obama and a veteran gop senator also are calling for changes in `` stand your ground '' self-defense laws in the aftermath of the trayvon martin killing . despite such pressure tactics , neither obama nor congress have much say in the matter because the battleground for altering or eliminating the statutes is in state legislatures rather than washington . florida , where martin was shot to death last year by neighborhood watch volunteer george zimmerman , is one of more than 20 states with a `` stand your ground '' law or some other form self-defense measure . last week , gov. the rough-and-tumble world of legislating is not orderly and civil , human frailties too often taint its membership , and legislative outcomes are often frustrating and ineffective ... still , we are not exaggerating when we say that congress is essential to american democracy . we would not have survived as a nation without a congress that represented the diverse interests of our society , conducted a public debate on the major issues , found compromises to resolve conflicts peacefully , and limited the power of our executive , military , and judicial institutions ... the popularity of congress ebbs and flows with the public 's confidence in government generally ... the legislative process is easy to dislike -- it often generates political posturing and grandstanding , it necessarily involves compromise , and it often leaves broken promises in its trail .
the name `` kremlin '' means `` fortress inside a city '' , and is often also used metonymically to refer to the government of the russian federation in a similar sense to how `` white house '' refers to the executive office of the president of the united states . it previously referred to the government of the soviet union -lrb- 1922 -- 1991 -rrb- and its highest members -lrb- such as general secretaries , premiers , presidents , ministers , and commissars -rrb- . the term `` kremlinology '' refers to the study of soviet and russian politics . in february 2004 , four months after the publication of the tales of a kremlin digger , tregubova received a telephone call from a man claiming to be a sheremetyevo international airport employee . he told her that he had a package for her and asked for her delivery address . when she declined to provide it and asked from what telephone number he was calling , he hung up . on february 2 , 2004 , a bomb exploded outside the door to her moscow apartment . tregubova 's best-selling book the tales of a kremlin digger , published in october 2003 , describes her experiences as a kremlin correspondent and criticizes the customs of the russian political elite . in particular , she described the involvement of putin administration in state control of the media . the tales of a kremlin digger annoyed the kremlin . after the book appeared , tregubova lost her job as a correspondent for kommersant .

mitt romney 's gambit of running as the anti-barack obama could still work , republican strategists say , if the presidential hopeful spends less time trying to define his opponent and more time spelling out how he would handle the job . `` it would have to take a serious effort to define the race on -lrb- the romney campaign 's -rrb- terms , '' said one veteran republican strategist familiar with the inner workings of the campaign . `` they are going to have to run a more disciplined campaign . he needs to make the connection of what the state of the economy is and what his policies are . '' a forceful mitt romney went toe-to-toe with president barack obama on the dominant issues for voters , challenging the democrat 's policies on the economy , taxes and health care in the first of three debates ahead of the november election . in exchanges full of policy proposals , facts and figures , the republican challenger was more aggressive in the 90-minute encounter in criticizing obama 's record and depicting the president 's vision as one of big government . the president firmly defended his achievements and challenged his rival 's prescriptions as unworkable . neither candidate scored dramatic blows that will make future highlight reels , and neither veered from campaign themes and policies to date . mitt romney 's solid debate performance wednesday night gives him the type of energy and momentum that president barack obama now will have to work overtime to undo . `` the thing that this debate did is it gave people reasons to think about -lrb- a -rrb- president romney , '' said john geer , chairman of vanderbilt university 's political science department . `` this often happens with challengers in the first debate . now obama needs to reconnect with the american public and -lrb- make the case of -rrb- why he should be re-elected .

'' ginsburg , 86 , said that as the `` next eldest in attendance '' she had the opportunity to ride with him on long drives and his mind `` remained vibrant '' and he spoke not only of court cases but footnotes in various opinions . `` his conversation was engaging , his memory amazing , '' she said . as justice john paul stevens returns to the supreme court for the final time to lie in repose , he will be accompanied by about 80 of his former clerks , 12 of whom will serve as honorary pallbearers as others line the steps of the marble building as his casket arrives . once inside , the clerks are expected to rotate `` standing vigil '' over the casket while well-wishers pay their respects . chief justice john roberts , justices ruth bader ginsburg , samuel alito , sonia sotomayor , elena kagan and retired justice anthony kennedy participated in a brief ceremony in the great hall monday morning . justices neil gorsuch , brett kavanaugh , stephen breyer and clarence thomas all had long-standing commitments , according to the court 's public information officer .

while hellmann 's mayonnaise thrived on the u.s. east coast , selling $ 15 million a year by 1927 with $ 1 million in profits , the california company postum foods -lrb- later best foods -rrb- introduced their own mayonnaise , best foods mayonnaise , which became popular on the west coast , and was operating a major plant in san francisco . in august 1927 postum foods bought the hellmann 's brand , allowing hellmann to retire . by then both brands of mayonnaise had such commanding market shares in their respective halves of the country that the company decided that both brands and recipes be preserved in their respective territories . when best foods acquired the hellmann 's brand , it decided to preserve the respective recipes for both mayonnaises . however , at least as recently as june 2003 , the recipes were almost identical . from the company 's faqs at the time : hellmann 's and best foods are brand names that are used for the same line of mayonnaise and other food products . the hellmann 's brand is sold in the united kingdom , the united states east of the rocky mountains , latin america , europe , australia , the middle east , canada , belgium , the netherlands india and south africa . the best foods brand is sold in the united states west of the rocky mountains , and also in asia , australia , and new zealand .
lastly , it was not the presidential election of 1800 that led to burr and hamilton 's duel . burr did become jefferson 's vice-president , but when jefferson decided not to run with burr for reelection in 1804 , burr opted to run for governor of new york instead . burr lost to morgan lewis in a landslide . afterwards , a letter was published in the albany register from charles d. cooper to philip schuyler , claiming that hamilton called burr `` a dangerous man , and one who ought not be trusted with the reins of government '' , and that he knew of `` a still more despicable opinion which general hamilton has expressed of mr. burr '' . on december 19 , 1980 , the daily press reported a committee authorized by the pac recommended that the airport change its name to `` newport news/williamsburg international '' to then-executive director michael white . this change would not take place until ten years later . at the time , the commission members represented the cities of newport news , hampton , and williamsburg , as well as james city county and york county . since 2010 , the commission consists of six commissioners who are appointed by the cities of hampton -lrb- 2 -rrb- and newport news -lrb- 4 -rrb- . the fact that the name formerly appeared as `` newport 's news '' is verified by numerous early documents and maps , and by local tradition . the change to newport news came about through usage ; by 1851 the post office department sanctioned `` new port news '' -lrb- written as three words -rrb- as the name of the first post office . in 1866 it approved the name as `` newport news '' , the current form .
the fitbit charge 3 , a wristwatch-like health and fitness tracker introduced in october 2018 , was the first device to feature an oxygen saturation -lrb- spo2 -rrb- sensor - however , it is non-functional and fitbit has yet to give a timeline for the feature to be enabled . this is creating significant customer backlash as of january 2019 . the device has a touchscreen display , goal-based exercise modes and some smart features . as part of the quantified self movement , the fuelband allows its wearers to track their physical activity , steps taken daily , and amount of energy burned . the information from the wristband is integrated into the nike + online community and phone application , allowing wearers to set their own fitness goals , monitor their progression , and compare themselves to others part of the community . nike + relies on the gamification of fitness activities turning all tracked movement into nikefuel points , which can unlock achievements , can be shared with friends , or can be used to engage others in competition . the term `` activity trackers '' now primarily refers to wearable devices that monitor and record a person 's fitness activity . the concept grew out of written logs that led to spreadsheet-style computer logs in which entries were made manually , such as that provided in the us by the president 's council on physical fitness and sports as part of the president 's challenge . improvements in technology in the late 20th and early 21st century allow automating the monitoring and recording of fitness activities and integrating them into more easily worn equipment . early examples include wristwatch-sized bicycle computers that monitored speed , duration , distance , etc. , available at least by the early 1990s .

'' ... you carried that network on your shoulders for a lot of years . '' lauer , of course , was himself the long-time cornerstone of the `` today '' show , one of the most profitable franchises on television .
following red 2 , zeta-jones took another sabbatical from acting , saying : `` if i 'm going to leave my family for any length of time it had better be for a role that i have n't played before , i would prefer to stay at home '' . she found the role opposite bill nighy and toby jones in the british war comedy film dad 's army -lrb- 2016 -rrb- , based on the television sitcom of the same name . she was cast as a glamorous journalist reporting on a british home guard platoon based in walmington-on-sea . catherine bray of variety found the film to be an `` amiable but creaky resurrection '' of the popular sitcom , and thought that while zeta-jones `` hits the required single note with some spirit '' she was `` generally underused '' in it . zeta-jones 's career graph and marriage to douglas have been a subject of satire . a 2006 episode of the satirical british television show star stories -lrb- 2006 -- 2008 -rrb- was entitled catherine zeta-jones -- her quest to prove herself ... and also find love , about a fictitious life story of zeta-jones . addressing her perceived media image , zeta-jones remarked in a 2004 interview to usa weekend : `` the biggest misconception of me is that i 'm some die-hard , ambitious , do-anything-to-get-anything kind of person , i 'm not . i 'm very shy socially . '' the film received mixed reviews from the only two critics that were published , and both panned zeta-jones ' performance . writing for indiewire , hanh nguyen criticised the decision to cast zeta-jones in the part of a latina woman , adding that `` she 's not just unconvincing ; she 's outlandish '' . similarly , ciara lavelle of the miami new times called the made-for-tv movie `` campy '' and `` sexist '' ; and felt that zeta-jones `` struggles to embody the role of a 17-year-old colombian immigrant , and though her portrayal solidifies as the story progresses , her accent remains cringeworthy throughout . -lrb- at least in her later , allegedly cocaine-addicted years , you can blame it on the drugs . -rrb- ''
murphy , dietz , and axelson were killed in the action . luttrell was the only u.s. survivor and was eventually rescued , after several days of wandering in the mountains and being protected by the people of an afghan village . all three of murphy 's men were awarded the navy 's second-highest honor , the navy cross , for their part in the battle making theirs the most decorated navy seal team in history . operation red wings was a counter-insurgent mission in kunar province , afghanistan , involving four members of the united states navy seals . murphy and two other seals , danny dietz and matthew axelson , were killed in the fighting , in addition to 16 u.s. special operations soldiers , who were killed when their helicopter was shot down while attempting to extract the seal team . prior to a helicopter being shot down in 2011 , it was both the largest loss of life for u.s. forces since the invasion began and the largest loss for the seals since the vietnam war . marcus luttrell was the only surviving u.s. sailor from the squad ; he was protected by local villagers , who sent an emissary to the closest military base , allowing a rescue team to locate him . burr was reportedly married at the beginning of world war ii to a scottish actress named annette sutherland -- killed , burr said , in the same 1943 plane crash that claimed the life of actor leslie howard . however , multiple sources have reported that no one by that name appears on any of the published passenger manifests from the flight . : 19 -- 20 a son supposedly born during this marriage , michael evan , was said to have died of leukemia in 1953 at the age of ten . another marriage purportedly took place in the early 1950s to a laura andrina morgan -- who died of cancer , burr said , in 1955 .
two of the country 's largest and most influential religious groups , the u.s. conference of catholic bishops and the national association of evangelicals , are urging the united states not to halt the resettlement of syrian refugees after the deadly terrorist attack in paris last friday . `` of course we want to keep terrorists out of our country , but let 's not punish the victims of isis for the sins of isis , '' leith anderson , nae president , said on tuesday . house speaker paul ryan has called for a `` pause '' in the u.s. program accepting syrian refugees and 30 governors have said they will not welcome them , though they have little legal authority to bar the federal government from settling refugees in their states . meanwhile , almost every gop presidential candidate has said the united states should stop admitting syrian refugees . when islamic state claimed responsibility for the attacks in paris that have killed at least 129 people , it warned that more would follow . french president , françois hollande , has in turn vowed to show `` no mercy '' in his response . this pledge is bound to have a profound effect on border controls and the treatment of syrian refugees in the country . but france has the option to show the world that it will continue to stand for `` liberté , égalité and fraternité . '' republicans are putting president barack obama and his party on the defensive over accepting syrian refugees , following reports that one of the terrorists involved in the paris attacks entered europe as part of the wave of syrians fleeing civil war . gop governors and lawmakers were quick to announce they would n't allow syrian refugees into their states and are appealing for stronger control of u.s. borders . the issue opens up a firm political line of attack for republican presidential candidates who had been struggling to find their footing on the national security challenges posed by the paris slaughter . the rhetoric on the right clearly angered obama , who argued at a press conference monday that the united states must remain committed to its values of tolerance and accepting immigrants .
berkeley is home to the oldest campus in the university of california system , the university of california , berkeley , and the lawrence berkeley national laboratory , which is managed and operated by the university . it also has the graduate theological union , one of the largest religious studies institutions in the world . berkeley is considered one of the most socially liberal cities in the united states . the term university of california has come to refer to the entire university of california system . the campus office for trademarks disallows the use of cal berkeley , though it is occasionally used colloquially . unlike most university of california campuses , which are commonly known by their initials , usage of ucb is discouraged -lrb- as is university of california at berkeley , except in instances where use of the comma would cause confusion -rrb- , and the domain name is berkeley.edu . while ucb.edu and ucberkeley.edu are also registered by the school , they are not actively used . the college of california 's college homestead association planned to raise funds for the new campus by selling off adjacent parcels of land . to this end , they laid out a plat and street grid that became the basis of berkeley 's modern street plan . their plans fell far short of their desires , and they began a collaboration with the state of california that culminated in 1868 with the creation of the public university of california .
in june 2006 , limbaugh was detained by drug enforcement agents at palm beach international airport . customs officials confiscated viagra from limbaugh 's luggage as he was returning from the dominican republic . the prescription was not in limbaugh 's name . after he was released with no charges filed , limbaugh joked about the incident on his radio show , claiming that he got the viagra at the clinton library and was told they were blue m&m 's . two weeks before the pat sajak show was canceled , on march 30 , 1990 , radio host rush limbaugh made headlines when he guest hosted the program , and , in a departure from its regular format , entered the audience to get a response about the veto of a bill in idaho which would have restricted abortion . directly after announcing that the bill was vetoed , limbaugh went to the first woman who stood up and was cheering the loudest . the woman denounced limbaugh 's anti-abortion statements earlier in the show , stating `` women 's lives are more important than any potato '' and `` you do n't know what it 's about . you 'll never have a baby , you 'll never be pregnant . the rush limbaugh -- sandra fluke controversy began on february 29 , 2012 , when american conservative talk-show host rush limbaugh 's remarks about contraceptive mandates included statements labeling georgetown university law center student sandra fluke as a `` slut '' and `` prostitute '' . limbaugh was commenting on fluke 's speech the previous week to house democrats in support of mandating insurance coverage for contraceptives . despite disapproval from major political figures , limbaugh made numerous similar statements over the next two days , which led to the loss of several of his national sponsors and limbaugh apologizing on his show for some of his comments . fluke rejected the apology as dubious and inadequate .

after the event , starbucks released a statement on plans to shut stores and corporate offices on may 29 for racial-bias education for approximately 175,000 u.s. employees . on may 2 , it was reported that the two men settled for a symbolic $ 1 each and a promise from city officials that a program for young entrepreneurs would be established . this is separate from the starbucks financial settlement that was announced in a joint statement between the two men , and starbucks . in the settlement starbucks has included the two men earn their bachelor 's degrees with the tuition covered , and discuss their experience with former u.s. attorney general eric holder as part of the company 's diversity efforts . starbucks first became profitable in seattle in the early 1980s . despite an initial economic downturn with its expansion into the midwest and british columbia in the late 1980s , the company experienced revitalized prosperity with its entry into california in the early 1990s . the first starbucks location outside north america opened in tokyo in 1996 ; overseas properties now constitute almost one-third of its stores . the company opened an average of two new locations daily between 1987 and 2007 . in july 2008 , the company announced it was closing 600 underperforming company-owned stores and cutting u.s. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty . on july 29 , 2008 , starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit . of the new cuts , 550 of the positions were layoffs and the rest were unfilled jobs . these closings and layoffs effectively ended the company 's period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s .
democratic rep. debbie dingell said thursday that president donald trump 's attacks on her and her late husband rep. john dingell will not intimidate her and that she does n't want an apology from the president . trump , speaking at a rally wednesday night in battle creek , michigan , implied the former congressman , whose seat is now held by his wife , was `` looking up '' from hell . he said that he gave the family the `` a-plus treatment '' after john dingell died , and that the congresswoman told him during an emotional call following john dingell 's funeral that her husband would have been `` thrilled '' by the respect shown for him during his funeral and `` he 's looking down '' on the ceremonies . `` maybe he 's looking up , '' trump said at the rally , drawing some moans and groans from those at the rally , which was about two hours away from debbie dingell 's district . house speaker nancy pelosi on thursday responded to president donald trump 's attacks on democratic congresswoman debbie dingell and her late husband rep. john dingell . asked about the president 's insinuation at a rally in michigan last night that the late congressman is `` looking up '' from hell , pelosi was somber , saying , `` let us pray for the president , '' and adding that trump `` clearly is insecure .

'' trump drew widespread criticism on wednesday when , during a rally in dingell 's home state of michigan , he implied that the late democratic congressman was `` looking up '' from hell . `` the bottom line is , it 's not a funny joke and you 're not helping yourself , '' graham , speaking to reporters following a meeting with the president at the white house , said he told trump . graham , a south carolina republican , said that there 's `` no personal animosity '' between trump and dingell , arguing that trump had `` made sure '' that dingell was `` honored as being one of the greatest members of the house ever '' with a full military funeral .
after the 14th dalai lama , tenzin gyatso , escaped from tibet with his followers in 1959 and took refuge in india , the focus on tibetan buddhism spread further and attracted immense international sympathy and support . the dalai lama found dharamshala in himachal pradesh as an ideal place to establish his `` capital in exile '' at mcleod ganj in close vicinity to dharamshala , and is called the little lhasa and also as dhasa -lrb- a combination of dharamshala and lhasa in tibet -rrb- . this situation has given the state a unique status in the global firmament of buddhist traditions . it is now the cradle of tibetan buddhism , with its undeniable link to the past activities initiated in the 8th century -lrb- in 747 ad -rrb- by guru padmasambhava -lrb- who went to tibet from rewalsar in himachal pradesh in north india to spread buddhism -rrb- , who was known as the `` guru rinpoche '' and the `` second buddha '' . an important buddhist shrine -lrb- located opposite to the namgyal monastery in the same courtyard -rrb- in the town is the tsuglagkhang or tsuglag khang , known as the dalai lama 's temple . it houses the statues , in sitting postures , of shakyamuni -lrb- gilded -rrb- - the central image , avalokiteśvara -lrb- the deity of compassion sculpted in silver with eleven faces and thousand arms and eyes - linked to a legend -rrb- , and padmasambhava -lrb- guru rinpoche -rrb- -- both facing the direction of tibet -- and also the tibetan institute of performing arts . dalai lama 's residence is opposite to this temple . a festival is held here every year , during april and may , when traditional dances and plays are enacted .8 kilometres -lrb- 5.0 mi -rrb- away from dharamshala , at sidhpur , a small monastery called the gompa dip tse-chok ling , the gangchen kyishong -lrb- called gangkyi in short by tibetans and library by indians is the premises of the tibetan government-in-exile -rrb- , mani lakhang stupa , nechung monastery , norbulingka institute , sidhpur are located . rewalsar has an ancient divine link for the buddhists as it is believed that guru padmasambhava set out from here on his journey to tibet to propagate buddhist dharma . the rewalsar lake -lrb- ` tso pema ' or ` pad-ma-can ' to tibetans -rrb- has a legend that started the belief that on the islands of floating reeds of the lake the spirit of padmasambhava 's resides . according to folk legend , padmasmabhava tried to teach buddhist dharma to the daughter -lrb- mandarava -rrb- of the king of mandi , arshadhara of sahor , which was seriously resented by the king . it is also mentioned that mandarva was enamoured of padmasambhava of nalanda .
dominique francon is the heroine of the fountainhead , described by rand as `` the woman for a man like howard roark '' . rand described dominique as similar to herself `` in a bad mood '' . for most of the novel , the character operates from what rand viewed as wrong ideas . believing that the values she admires can not survive in the real world , she chooses to turn away from them so that the world can not harm her . professor kingsfield refers to the `` hairy hand '' case in the opening scene of the popular movie the paper chase . harvard contract law classes actually began with this lesson for many years as part of oliver wendell holmes jr. 's theory that the study of contract law should begin with the remedies for a broken promise . the family did not learn about the case 's use in the paper chase until gail 's mother , edith , saw the movie during its first run in 1973 . the sequence in the bar was the last perry mason scene to be filmed . in her sole appearance in the series , gail patrick jackson broke the rule against ad libs . the script called for her to say , `` i would n't take that show if they begged me . who wants that time slot ? ''
in a 2004 study , tim groseclose and jeff milyo argue the journal 's news pages have a pro-liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks . they calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular think tanks and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks . they found that the news reporting of the journal was the most liberal -lrb- more liberal than npr or the new york times -rrb- . the study did not factor in editorials . the daily journal was first published in old town albuquerque , but in 1882 the publication moved to a single room in the so-called new town -lrb- or expanded albuquerque -rrb- at second and silver streets near the railroad tracks . it was published on a single sheet of newsprint , folded to make four pages . those pages were divided into five columns with small headlines . advertising appeared on the front page . although it is the journal of the aaas , membership in the aaas is not required to publish in science . papers are accepted from authors around the world . competition to publish in science is very intense , as an article published in such a highly cited journal can lead to attention and career advancement for the authors . fewer than 7 % of articles submitted are accepted for publication .

in 1970 , hollings authored the case against hunger : a demand for a national policy , acknowledging the reverend i.d. newman and sister mary anthony for opening his eyes to the despair caused by hunger and helping him realize that he must do something about it . hollings made headlines the year before when he toured poverty-stricken areas of south carolina , often referred to as his `` hunger tours . '' he was accused of drawing unwanted attention to south carolina when other states -- north and south -- also faced extreme poverty . hollings remained very popular in south carolina over the years , even as the state became increasingly friendly to republicans at the national level . in his first three bids for a full term , he never dropped below 60 percent of the vote . in the 1992 election , however , he faced an unexpectedly close race against former congressman tommy hartnett in what was otherwise a very good year for democrats nationally . hartnett had represented the charleston area in congress from 1981 to 1987 , thus making him hollings ' congressman . on march 24 , 1981 , hollings introduced legislation that if passed would restore the military draft with limited deferments and exemptions and stipulating that men aged 18 to 22 years old would be required to spend nine months of active service for basic training that potentially would precede reserve duty . hollings ' proposal granted deferments `` to people on active duty , in the reserves or in advanced reserve officers training corps study ; surviving sons or brothers of those killed in war or missing in action ; conscientious objectors and ministers ; doctors and others in vital health professions , and judges of courts of record and elected officials . '' hollings stated that recruiting for the armed forces had fallen short of requirements by an estimated 23,000 people in 1979 and that he believed the draft applying to women `` should be across the board '' due to the issue continuing to be debated between the public and the courts .
in the lowest moments of my life , the only reason i did n't commit suicide was that i knew i would n't be able to drink any more if i was dead . it was the only thing i thought was worth living for , and the idea that people were about to try and remove me from alcohol was so terrible that i drank and drank and drank , and they had to practically carry me into the clinic . elias leight of rolling stone writes that clapton `` influenced recording techniques as well as guitar-playing technique '' . during recording sessions with john mayall 's group , clapton was frustrated by technicians `` that just came up to your amp with the microphone and just stuck it two inches away from the front of the amplifier . it seemed to me that if you wanted to get the atmosphere we were getting in the clubs , you needed it to sound like you were in the audience 10 feet away , not three inches '' . clapton then moved the microphones , with pink floyd 's roger waters stating , `` that changed everything . `` i think this got made because eric was in the right mood . he 's an incredibly private man and despite his immense success , he 's never cared if he got any publicity at all , he just loves his music ... i think it might be something to do with his age , as he turned 70 a couple of years ago . he said to me , `` i did n't want it to be done after i was dead and for it to be wrong . ''
nice has been criticised for being too slow to reach decisions . on one occasion , the royal national institute of blind people said it was outraged over its delayed decision for further guidance regarding two drugs for macular degeneration that are already approved for use in the nhs . however the department of health said that it had ` made it clear to pcts that funding for treatments should not be withheld simply because guidance from nice is unavailable ' . the national institutes of health was created on january 26 , 1996 by the up board of regents to enhance research undertakings of up manila with regards to public health . it serves as an institutional home of a network of researchers and research institutions . eventually , nih was established as the national health research center of the philippines through the health research and development act of 1998 , otherwise known as republic act 8503 . the international association of national public health institutes -lrb- ianphi -rrb- is a member organization of nphis that currently has members from 61 countries . ianphi helps link the nphis of the world , so that they can share knowledge and experiences , in addition to providing support for nphi development in low-resources countries . the majority of funding for ianphi comes from the bill and melinda gates foundation .
an anonymizer such as i2p -- the anonymous network or tor can be used for accessing web services without them knowing one 's ip address and without one 's isp knowing what the services are that one accesses . additional software has been developed that may provide more secure and anonymous alternatives to other applications . for example , bitmessage can be used as an alternative for email and cryptocat as an alternative for online chat . on the other hand , in addition to end-to-end encryption software , there are web services such as qlink which provide privacy through a novel security protocol which does not require installing any software . in 2005 , san francisco craigslist 's men seeking men section was attributed to facilitating sexual encounters and was the second most common correlation to syphilis infections . the company has been pressured by san francisco department of public health officials , prompting jim buckmaster to state that the site has a very small staff and that the public `` must police themselves '' . the site has , however , added links to san francisco city clinic and std forums . one of the most popular topics of discussion in regards to internet privacy is china . although china is known for its remarkable reputation on maintaining internet privacy among many online users , it could potentially be a major jeopardy to the lives of many online users who have their information exchanged on the web on a regular basis . for instance , in china , there is a new software that will enable the concept of surveillance among the majority of online users and present a risk to their privacy . the main concern with privacy of internet users in china is the lack thereof .
texas -lrb- , locally ; spanish : texas or tejas , pronounced -lrb- listen -rrb- -rrb- is the second largest state in the united states by area -lrb- after alaska -rrb- and population -lrb- after california -rrb- . located in the south central region , texas shares borders with the states of louisiana to the east , arkansas to the northeast , oklahoma to the north , new mexico to the west , and the mexican states of chihuahua , coahuila , nuevo león , and tamaulipas to the southwest , and has a coastline with the gulf of mexico to the southeast . houston is the most populous city in texas and the fourth largest in the u.s. , while san antonio is the second-most populous in the state and seventh largest in the u.s. dallas -- fort worth and greater houston are the fourth and fifth largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country , respectively . other major cities include austin , the second-most populous state capital in the u.s. , and el paso .
university of california , irvine had in mark poster one of the first and foremost theorists of media culture in the us , and can boast a strong department of film & media studies . university of california , berkeley has three institutional structures within which media studies can take place : the department of film and media -lrb- formerly film studies program -rrb- , including famous theorists as mary ann doane and linda williams , the center for new media , and a long established interdisciplinary program formerly titled mass communications , which recently changed its name to media studies , dropping any connotations which accompany the term `` mass '' in the former title . until recently , radford university in virginia used the title `` media studies '' for a department that taught practitioner-oriented major concentrations in journalism , advertising , broadcast production and web design . in 2008 , those programs were combined with a previous department of communication -lrb- speech and public relations -rrb- to create a school of communication . in his book `` understanding media , the extensions of man '' , media theorist marshall mcluhan suggested that `` the medium is the message '' , and that all human artefacts and technologies are media . his book introduced the usage of terms such as `` media '' into our language along with other precepts , among them `` global village '' and `` age of information '' . a medium is anything that mediates our interaction with the world or other humans . given this perspective , media study is not restricted to just media of communications but all forms of technology . media monitor was the bi-monthly publication of the center for media and public affairs , which presented the central findings of one or more research studies on media monitoring . it was started in 1987 and last published in 2010 . it was a concise analysis of contemporary media coverage and the controversies that surround it . the research published was the result of quantitative content analysis of television , print , and radio news .
the last incarnation of the franchise was the television program honey , i shrunk the kids : the tv show . peter scolari took over as wayne and nick and amy both returned as characters , roughly the same age as in the original film , and played by new actors . its plots involved other wacky szalinski inventions -lrb- rarely the shrinking machine -rrb- that do not work quite as expected and land the family in some type of humorous mixed-up adventure . in 1997 , disney produced the second sequel , honey , we shrunk ourselves , as a direct to video release . rick moranis was the only returning actor from the previous films who reprised his role , with amy and nick having gone off to college and quark 's disappearance never being explained . many new characters were added such as wayne 's brother , gordon , and his family . this time , the parents are shrunk and need to be rescued by their kids . in february 2018 , it was announced that live-action remakes of several films are in development as exclusive content for disney + , with one of those named in the announcement as being honey , i shrunk the kids . it was later confirmed that a `` legacy-sequel '' film titled shrunk is in development to be released theatrically , with a plot that centers around nick szalinski as an adult scientist . josh gad will star as nick in the film . on december 5 , 2019 , it was reported that joe johnston is in talks to return as director .
`` harriet '' director kasi lemmons has said she pitched the movie as the `` superhero origin story of harriet tubman . '' the result is a biography that stirringly conveys the underground railroad leader 's heroism , but which also hollywood-izes her story in occasionally distracting ways . cynthia erivo -lrb- perhaps best known for her starring role in `` the color purple '' on broadway -rrb- plays tubman , a slave on a maryland plantation . introduced in 1849 , araminta ross , or `` minty '' as she 's known , has already seen her sisters sold away . when music icon prince passed away from an accidental overdose in 2016 he was in the midst of writing his intimate autobiography . three years on and , with the help of prince 's chosen collaborator dan piepenbring , `` the beautiful ones '' has been completed and was released on tuesday by cornerstone . detailing how he carefully curated material for the book , piepenbring told the guardian : `` the sheer quantity of paper was surprising . `` there was no real method to the madness . rock 'n roll might be a young person 's game , but bruce springsteen shows no signs of slowing down as he hits his 70th birthday , and indeed has exhibited an appetite to expand his creative horizons . so he follows the netflix special capturing his broadway show with `` western stars , '' a deeply personal film performing songs from his latest album , which also marks his debut as a director . co-director , actually , since springsteen shares those chores with longtime collaborator thomas zimny -- with whom he collaborated on `` the promise : the making of darkness on the edge of town '' and `` springsteen on broadway '' -- in an 80-some-odd minute presentation that weds the music to springsteen 's stage-honed storytelling skills , coupled with gauzy images of him and his wife , patti scialfa . it is , clearly , a valentine for hardcore `` bruuuuuce '' fans , but one that does an effective job of both showcasing the material and connecting the songs in a thematic way , supporting an album that springsteen describes near the outset as a meditation on `` the struggle between individual freedom and communal life .

a few months later , life as normal has resumed at arnold 's grandparents ' boarding house , though now with miles and stella living there as well . arnold says goodbye to his parents as he heads off for his first day of sixth grade with gerald , phoebe , and helga . gerald and phoebe are seen holding hands walking to school together , while arnold and helga are also implied to be a couple despite helga pretending to remain hostile towards arnold at once in public . arnold 's parents walk with him and his friends to school and arnold promises his mom and dad that they 'll see him at 3:30 as the doors close behind him . butler lives in vermont and is married to producer richard waterhouse . he came out to his family when he was in his early 20s . he wrote a one-man show , the only thing worse you could have told me , which opened in los angeles in 1994 and also played in san francisco and off-broadway in new york . it was butler 's public coming out . helga geraldine pataki -lrb- voiced by francesca marie smith -rrb- is a 9-10 year old rough and cynical girl who puts on a mean , rude , deceitful , tomboyish front , making her a bully , and often the antagonist of the series , which was arnold 's arch-rival yet love interest . she constantly bullies arnold and other people , but yet loves him , which is obsessive to the point where she has made many shrines dedicated to him . she is an academically-gifted student and a talented writer of poetry for her age . she despises arnold because he was bad influence and his football-head was being different to most others .
in july 2008 , christian bale was filming a scene in new mexico for the film terminator salvation with actress bryce dallas howard . the film 's director of photography , shane hurlbut , walked into bale 's line of sight , and the actor proceeded to yell obscenities at hurlbut . bale said he would quit the film if hurlbut repeated the error and was not subsequently fired . hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times to bale , and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident . while most celebrities who attended the oscars sunday night slipped into their second look of the evening before hitting up the after-parties , melissa mccarthy and her husband ben falcone had something else in mind . the couple turned up at vanity fair 's bash wearing matching adidas tracksuits . `` it 's not to me guys , '' she told entertainment tonight before entering the party . `` i 've doubled my diamonds -- i feel great . '' with the 2019 awards calendar reaching its grand finale at the oscars sunday evening , so too does a season of show-stopping red carpet fashion . while the tone was relatively restrained -- compared with the bold statements of recent award ceremonies , at least -- many stars had saved their best for last . all eyes were on the best actress nominees as they arrived at the dolby theatre in hollywood from mid-afternoon . lady gaga evoked the spirit of vintage hollywood in a stunning black alexander mcqueen dress .
the past week has been a devastating one for many families . zubeidat tsarnaev 's is one of them . but the mother of the two suspects in the boston marathon bombings remains resolute in her belief that her sons were not involved in the attack . she told cnn 's nick paton walsh in makhachkala , dagestan , that she believes the tragedy that killed three people and injured dozens more was staged and that the bombing was fake . the fbi has flatly rejected an assertion by the mother of the two suspected boston bombers that the bureau had been tracking her oldest son and had spoken with him last week after the deadly marathon bombing . the chief spokesman for the fbi , mike kortan , said he continues to stand by an fbi statement issued friday that said that the only communication the fbi ever had with tamerlan tsarnaev was an interview agents conducted with him in 2011 at the urging of a foreign government , since identified as russia . did one brother brainwash the other ? zubeidat tsarnaev , the mother of the suspected bombers , told reporters the fbi had tracked her oldest son for as long as five years . the body of boston marathon bombing suspect tamerlan tsarnaev lies unclaimed in a state morgue . authorities had not yet determined a cause of death on wednesday , and no one had stepped forward to claim the body , said terrel harris , a spokesman for the massachusetts state medical examiner . the suspects ' mother , zubeidat tsarnaev , said she wanted her son to be buried near a cambridge mosque and told cnn earlier in the week that family members had arranged for a funeral on tuesday or wednesday . but the islamic society of boston said wednesday that the family had not contacted local mosque officials with any funeral requests .
notably , the tobacco companies argued that the increased size of warning labels on cigarette packing and new restrictions on the design of the packaging interfere with their first amendment rights to communicate with adult consumers . in addition , they argued against the ban on publicizing relative risk claims about their products , which would apply to light cigarettes and various forms of smokeless tobacco on first amendment grounds . in 1964 , surgeon general luther terry issued a report on smoking and health saying that tobacco causes lung cancer and is a main contributor to bronchitis . members of the federal trade commission read the report the day it was released and quickly proposed a mandatory cigarette label that warned , `` caution : cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health and may cause death from cancer and other diseases . '' however , legislation ultimately passed by congress required a warning label with less dire language : `` caution : cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health . '' in 1965 , the united states congress passed the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act -lrb- fclaa -rrb- , which required a health warning on all cigarette packs . the pure food and drug act of 1906 was the first of a series of significant consumer protection laws which was enacted by congress in the 20th century and led to the creation of the food and drug administration . its main purpose was to ban foreign and interstate traffic in adulterated or mislabeled food and drug products , and it directed the u.s. bureau of chemistry to inspect products and refer offenders to prosecutors . it required that active ingredients be placed on the label of a drug 's packaging and that drugs could not fall below purity levels established by the united states pharmacopeia or the national formulary . the jungle by upton sinclair , with its graphic and revolting descriptions of unsanitary conditions and unscrupulous practices rampant in the meatpacking industry , was an inspirational piece that kept the public 's attention on the important issue of unhygienic meat processing plants that later led to food inspection legislation .
in 2016-17 , mayo clinic , rochester , was ranked as the # 1 overall hospital in the united states by u.s. news & world report . a total of almost 5,000 hospitals were considered and ranked in 16 specialties from cancer and heart disease to respiratory disorders and urology ; 153 -lrb- just over 3 percent of the total -rrb- were ranked in at least one of the 16 specialties . of the 153 hospitals that are ranked in one or more specialties , 20 qualified for the honor roll by earning high scores in at least six specialties . mayo clinic , rochester , was ranked in the top 10 in all but one of 16 specialties , in the top 4 in 13 specialties , and was the # 1 ranked hospital in 8 of the 12 data-driven specialties . the legitimate mayo clinic diet does not promote a high protein or `` key food '' approach . there have been diets falsely attributed to mayo clinic for decades . many or most web sites claiming to debunk the bogus version of the diet are actually promoting it or a similar fad diet . the mayo clinic website appears to no longer acknowledge the existence of the false versions and prefers to promote their own researched diet . students at mcasom are party to other mayo clinic traditions during their training . at the mayo clinic , faculty doctors are referred to as `` consultants '' , as opposed to the term `` attending '' used elsewhere . additionally , because the mayo brothers were left-handed surgeons , mayo medical students are taught to glove their left hand first when scrubbing in to procedures . first-year students also learn formal dining etiquette for meals at the mayo foundation house in preparation for benefactor events , visiting dignitaries , and society dinners -lrb- e.g.

the pew research center released its 10th annual report on global restrictions on religion as part of the pew-templeton global religious futures project , funded by the pew charitable trusts and the john templeton foundation . while the previous reports focused on year-over-year change , this report provides a broader look at the trend in particular regions and in 198 countries . the report documents how government restrictions on religion and social hostilities involving religion have changed and increased , from 2007 to 2017 . it said 52 governments impose high levels of restrictions on religion , up from 40 in 2007 , while 56 countries experienced the highest levels of social hostilities involving religion , up from 38 in 2007 . generally , there are few reports about how many people leave islam in muslim majority countries . the main reason for this is the social and legal repercussions associated with leaving islam in many muslim majority countries , up to and including the death penalty for apostasy . however , the report also suggest that in future , it is also possible that these societies could allow for greater freedom to religiously disaffiliate . on the other hand the increasingly large ex-muslim communities in the western world that adhere to no religion have been well documented . darren e. sherkat questioned in foreign affairs whether some of the muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious muslims . quantitative research is lacking , but he believes the european trend mirrors the american : data from the general social survey in the united states show that 22 percent of those raised muslim no longer embrace islam in adulthood , and 18 percent hold no religious identification .
the paul hogan show is a popular australian comedy show which aired on australian television from 1973 until 1984 . it made a star of paul hogan , who later appeared in `` crocodile '' dundee . hogan 's friend -lrb- and producer of crocodile dundee -rrb- john cornell also appeared in the show , playing hogan 's dim flatmate strop . australia 's seven network commissioned a two-part miniseries based upon hogan 's life , entitled hoges : the paul hogan story which aired in february 2017 . australian actor josh lawson portrayed hogan . in 2019 , to celebrate hogan 's upcoming 80th birthday , australia 's abc produced a two-part episode of australian story , entitled `` a fortunate life - paul hogan '' , in which hogan and his family reflect on his life and career . in 1993 , ife acquired the assets of defunct british itv broadcaster television south , whose holdings included the library of u.s. studio mtm enterprises . in 1997 , ife was acquired by news corporation ; the mtm library was melded into 20th century fox television 's library , while the remainder was melded into fox kids worldwide -lrb- a merger of its fox kids unit with saban entertainment -rrb- , to form fox family worldwide . fox and saban planned to leverage the popular fox kids lineup to turn the family channel -- which was re-branded as the fox family channel following the purchase -- into a competitor to other children 's - oriented cable channels such as cartoon network and nickelodeon . the subsidiary also established international fox kids networks in europe and latin america .
however , albania 's enver hoxha -lrb- another independent-minded communist leader -rrb- was a fierce enemy of the country and kim il-sung , writing in june 1977 that `` genuine marxist-leninists '' will understand that the `` ideology is guiding the korean workers ' party and the communist party of china ... is revisionist '' and adding later that month that `` in pyongyang , i believe that even tito will be astonished at the proportions of the cult of his host , which has reached a level unheard of anywhere else , either in past or present times , let alone in a country which calls itself socialist . '' he further claimed that `` the leadership of the communist party of china has betrayed . in korea , too , we can say that the leadership of the korean workers ' party is wallowing in the same waters '' and claimed that kim il sung was begging for aid from other countries , especially among the eastern bloc and non-aligned countries like yugoslavia . as a result , relations between north korea and albania would remain cold and tense right up until hoxha 's death in 1985 . a former cia official said earlier reports of a health crisis were likely accurate . north korean media remained silent on the issue . an associated press report said analysts believed kim had been supporting moderates in the foreign ministry , while north korea 's powerful military was against so-called `` six-party '' negotiations with china , japan , russia , south korea and the united states aimed towards ridding north korea of nuclear weapons . some united states officials noted that soon after rumours about kim 's health were publicized a month before , north korea had taken a `` tougher line in nuclear negotiations '' . after the death was announced , the south korean military was put on high alert . the south 's national security council , worried that political jockeying in north korea could destabilise the region , also convened for an emergency meeting . president lee myung-bak cancelled the rest of his monday schedule and in a statement , declared , `` or the sake of the future of the republic of korea , peace and stability on the korean peninsula is more important than anything else . it should not be threatened by what has happened .
yale has a complicated relationship with its home city ; for example , thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations , but city officials , who decry yale 's exemption from local property taxes , have long pressed the university to do more to help . under president levin , yale has financially supported many of new haven 's efforts to reinvigorate the city . evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial . still , the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy . the yale report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the latin and greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages , mathematics , and science . unlike higher education in europe , there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the united states . in the competition for students and financial support , college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation . at the same time , they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background . serious american students of theology and divinity , particularly in new england , regarded hebrew as a classical language , along with greek and latin , and essential for the study of the old testament in the original words . the reverend ezra stiles , president of the college from 1778 to 1795 , brought with him his interest in the hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient biblical texts in their original language -lrb- as was common in other schools -rrb- , requiring all freshmen to study hebrew -lrb- in contrast to harvard , where only upperclassmen were required to study the language -rrb- and is responsible for the hebrew phrase אורים ותמים -lrb- urim and thummim -rrb- on the yale seal . a 1746 graduate of yale , stiles came to the college with experience in education , having played an integral role in the founding of brown university in addition to having been a minister . stiles ' greatest challenge occurred in july 1779 when hostile british forces occupied new haven and threatened to raze the college .

the blind writer helen keller published an open letter to german students : ` you may burn my books and the books of the best minds in europe , but the ideas those books contain have passed through millions of channels and will go on . ' '' on may 10 , 1934 , one year after the book burnings , the germany library of burnt books founded by alfred kantorowicz was opened to assemble copies of the books that had been destroyed . because of the shift in political power and the blatant control and censorship demonstrated by the nazi party , 1933 saw a `` mass exodus of german writers , artists , and intellectuals ... '' . some went to america , some to england , and some to france . president barack obama visited arc energy on february 2 , 2010 . he touted arc energy in his speech at nashua north high school later that same day , `` that is why jobs will be our number one focus in 2010 . and we 're going to start where most new jobs do -- with small businesses . these are the companies that begin in basements and garages when an entrepreneur takes a chance on his dream , or a worker decides it 's time she became her own boss . alfred kantorowicz , the author of the 1944 article library of the burned books , was one of the key leaders instrumental in creating this library . in his article , he explains first-hand how the library came to be , and how it was finally destroyed . the library not only housed those books banned by the nazis , the more important mission was to be the `` center of intellectual anti-nazi activities '' . in addition , it had extensive archives `` on the history of nazism and the anti-nazi fight in all its forms '' .
in the general election , facing democratic nominee , senator barack obama of illinois , mccain was trailing during most of the season , only gaining a lead in national polls for a period after the palin announcement and the 2008 republican national convention . the dominant issue of the campaign became the financial crisis of 2007 -- 2008 . unable to gain traction against obama in presidential debates , the final stages of the campaign saw mccain criticizing obama for being a `` redistributionist '' and adopting symbols such as joe the plumber . on march 2 , 2017 , the john f. kennedy presidential library and museum awarded the annual profile in courage award to obama `` for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage . '' in his first public appearance out of office , obama appeared at a seminar at the university of chicago on april 24 . the seminar was aimed at the engagement with a new generation as well as an appeal for their participation in politics . on may 4 , three days ahead of the french presidential election , obama publicly endorsed emmanuel macron : `` he appeals to people 's hopes and not their fears , and i enjoyed speaking to emmanuel recently to hear about his independent movement and his vision for the future of france . '' upon returning to the campaign trail after her debate preparation , palin stepped up her attacks on the democratic candidate for president , illinois senator barack obama . at a fundraising event , palin explained her new aggressiveness , saying , `` there does come a time when you have to take the gloves off and that time is right now . '' palin said that her first amendment right to `` call obama out on his associations '' was threatened by `` attacks by the mainstream media . ''
although clinton was the 25th woman to run for u.s. president , she was the first female candidate to have held a highly probable chance of winning the nomination of a major party , and the presidential election . she was also the first woman to be an american presidential candidate in every primary and caucus in every state . as such , remarks surrounding her gender and appearance came to the fore . in march 2006 , actress sharon stone expressed her doubt about clinton 's presidential chances , saying `` hillary still has sexual power , and i do n't think people will accept that . when bill clinton took office as president in january 1993 , hillary rodham clinton became the first lady . her press secretary reiterated she would be using that form of her name . she was the first in this role to have a postgraduate degree and her own professional career up to the time of entering the white house . she was also the first to have an office in the west wing of the white house in addition to the usual first lady offices in the east wing . meanwhile , while not officially confirming interest in the vice presidential slot , clinton hinted at the possibility earlier on june 3 . when asked for clarification , her campaign released the statement `` today on a conference call with new york legislators , sen. clinton was asked whether she was open to the idea of running as vice president and repeated what she has said before : she would do whatever she could to ensure that democrats take the white house back and defeat john mccain . '' the vice presidential possibility had been raised by bill clinton in the previous month , but this fueled speculation that hillary clinton was definitively interested in the possibility .
on july 21 , 2017 , spicer announced his intention to resign as white house press secretary . he made his decision known immediately after president trump appointed financier anthony scaramucci as white house communications director . in the weeks leading up to the resignation announcement , spicer had sought `` a more strategic communications role '' in the white house . trump had reportedly been dissatisfied for some time with spicer 's performance as white house press secretary . during attorney general barr 's testimony before the senate judiciary committee on may 1 , barr again said he was looking into the origins of the fbi 's russia probe . `` many people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant and a fisa warrant , '' barr stated . `` i 'd like to find out whether that is in fact true . it strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort designed to stop a threat as it 's being represented . '' when asked by republican representative john cornyn `` can we state with confidence that the steele dossier was not part of the russian disinformation campaign '' barr responded `` no . even though the lines between politics and entertainment have been blurred from the beginning in the trump administration , sean spicer twirling the frills on the sleeves of his neon , lime-green shirt on `` dancing with the stars '' -lrb- `` dwts '' -rrb- have brought us to a collective new low . it is not funny , it is not entertainment , and most importantly , it is not okay . the reason most of us know sean spicer 's name is because he was one of the first real , tangible signs the public got of just how dysfunctional president donald trump 's white house was going to be . -lrb- melissa mccarthy 's portrayal of him on ` snl ' surely also gets an honorable mention in that regard as well . -rrb-

cbs news has announced criteria for saturday 's republican primary debate that could keep one or more candidates off the stage . donald trump , ted cruz and marco rubio are all guaranteed an invitation to the debate because they finished in the top three in the iowa caucuses . for the other candidates , it will require finishing in the top five in tuesday night 's new hampshire primary , or in the top five in an average of national and south carolina polls . those polls must be approved by cbs news and released before noon on feb. 12 . the republican presidential candidates left in the race after the iowa caucuses and new hampshire primary came out swinging saturday night during their last debate before the south carolina primary . cbs news moderated the heated exchange in greenville , south carolina . here are the night 's most memorable moments in gifs . the candidates first took to the stage and observed a moment of silence for the passing of supreme court justice antonin scalia . fast food and other low-paid workers are planning to protest outside saturday 's republican presidential debate in greenville , south carolina . the protesters at the `` fight for $ 15 '' rally will be demanding a $ 15 an hour minimum wage and the right to unionize . at 1 pm the protest will kick off with a walkout and will culminate in a 7 pm rally outside the debate . it comes just one week before the state 's primary .
according to several studies , coloradans have the lowest rates of obesity of any state in the u.s. . as of 2007 , 18 % of the population was considered medically obese , and while the lowest in the nation , the percentage had increased from 17 % in 2004 . according to a report in the journal of the american medical association , residents of colorado had a 2014 life expectancy of 80.21 years , the longest of any u.s. state . in the summer of 2004 , the university of colorado denver and the university of colorado health sciences center merged to create the university of colorado denver and health sciences center -lrb- `` ucdhsc '' -rrb- . as a result , the university of colorado encompassed three institutions , down from four . on october 29 , 2007 , the board of regents voted to rename ucdhsc as the `` university of colorado denver . '' the branding covered both the anschutz medical campus and the denver campus . by 1892 , the last two years of classes were taught in denver because the larger population afforded more practical experience . this triggered a turf battle with the private medical school at the university of denver , and the resulting legal battle went all the way to the supreme court of colorado . in 1897 , the supreme court found that the charter of the university of colorado restricted it to teaching in boulder .
others were less impressed with the film and wright 's take on such a classic text . the hertfordshire mercury conceded that `` costumes and art direction are ravishing , and seamus mcgarvey 's cinematography shimmers with rich colour '' , but ultimately found there to be `` no obvious method behind this production design madness '' . stella papamichael of digital spy also awarded the picture only two stars out of five , commenting that `` the third time is n't such a charm for director joe wright and muse keira knightley '' . although she found the actress `` luminous in the role '' she criticised wright for `` outshining '' his star and affecting the narrative momentum by `` favouring a glossy look over probing insights into a complicated character '' . there is also the question of the influence of such interpretations in people 's behaviour . in 2008 , psychologists kathleen vohs and jonathan schooler published a study on how people behave when they are prompted to think that determinism is true . they asked their subjects to read one of two passages : one suggesting that behaviour boils down to environmental or genetic factors not under personal control ; the other neutral about what influences behaviour . the participants then did a few math problems on a computer . everyone believes himself , a priori , perfectly free -- even in his individual actions , and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life . ... but a posteriori , through experience , he finds to his astonishment that he is not free , but subjected to necessity , that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct , and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it , he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns ...
in 2015 , the international agency for research on cancer -lrb- iarc -rrb- , a branch of the world health organization , cited research linking glyphosate , an ingredient of the weed killer roundup manufactured by the chemical company monsanto , to non-hodgkin 's lymphoma . in march 2017 , the presiding judge in a litigation brought about by people who claim to have developed glyphosate-related non-hodgkin 's lymphoma opened monsanto emails and other documents related to the case , including email exchanges between the company and federal regulators . according to an article in the new york times , the `` records suggested that monsanto had ghostwritten research that was later attributed to academics and indicated that a senior official at the environmental protection agency had worked to quash a review of roundup 's main ingredient , glyphosate , that was to have been conducted by the united states department of health and human services . '' the records show that monsanto was able to prepare `` a public relations assault '' on the finding after they were alerted to the determination by jess rowland , the head of the epa 's cancer assessment review committee at that time , months in advance . although environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of government protection acts , most people view these agencies as being of prime importance in establishing and maintaining basic standards that protect both the environment and the people interacting with it . the administrator of the environmental protection agency is the head of the united states federal government 's environmental protection agency , and is thus responsible for enforcing the nation 's clean air and clean water acts , as well as numerous other environmental statutes . the administrator is nominated by the president of the united states and must be confirmed by a vote of the senate . the office of administrator of the environmental protection agency was created in 1970 in legislation that created the agency .
dr. patricia powers states , `` it is not unusual to see program cuts in the area of music and arts when economic issues surface . it is indeed unfortunate to lose support in this area especially since music and the art programs contribute to society in many positive ways .

'' but former times editor r. w. apple jr. noted in reston 's obituary that he `` was forgiving of the frailties of soldiers , statesmen and party hacks -- too forgiving , some of his critics said , because he was too close to them '' .

when we made cars for the car shows , we worked at night and we were all tired , so we would joke around to keep our morale up . there was a profiler working with us who made the locks . he was two meters tall with two enormous hands , and he performed all the little jobs . he spoke almost only piedmontese , did n't even speak italian . lamborghini 's increasing wealth allowed him to purchase faster more expensive cars than the tiny fiats he had tinkered with during his youth . he owned cars such as alfa romeos and lancias during the early 1950s and at one point he had enough cars to use a different one every day of the week , adding a mercedes-benz 300sl , a jaguar e-type coupé , and two maserati 3500 gts . of the latter , lamborghini said , `` adolfo orsi , then the owner of maserati , was a man i had a lot of respect for : he had started life as a poor boy , like myself . but i did not like his cars much . there are n't too many tracks where mark webber can claim bragging rights over sebastian vettel but interlagos is one of them . the australian , who bows out of formula one at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , is a double winner -lrb- 2009 and 2011 -rrb- at the famous old sao paulo track while his red bull teammate can only claim a solitary triumph back in 2010 . many eyes will be on the german world champion as he looks to equal alberto ascari 's 60-year record of nine consecutive race wins , but there will be others who will be quietly willing the australian to a third victory at interlagos in his 215th and final race . `` i think on sunday it 'll be a little bit different but it still feels like a normal race at the moment , '' webber said thursday .

'' karim said the inspiration for youtube first came from janet jackson 's role in the 2004 super bowl incident , when her breast was exposed during her performance , and later from the 2004 indian ocean tsunami . karim could not easily find video clips of either event online , which led to the idea of a video sharing site . hurley and chen said that the original idea for youtube was a video version of an online dating service , and had been influenced by the website hot or not . difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans , with the site 's founders deciding to accept uploads of any type of video .
the pra focuses on planning and developing balanced mixed-use communities to create thriving , well-served neighborhoods . as the public government agency charged with the redevelopment of the city of philadelphia , the philadelphia redevelopment authority provides the foundations that enable private investors to revitalize neighborhoods . the authority 's function is to acquire real estate using the power of eminent domain , plan for redevelopment working with private firms , and financing the redevelopment by issuing municipal bonds of the authority , with the overall objective of eliminating urban blight in the city of philadelphia , pennsylvania . ura is responsible for the urban design of the city . for areas of especial interest , such as the singapore river area , the orchard road shopping belt , and marina bay ura devises specific medium and short-term urban design and land use plans . it also works with other government agencies in enhancing the city 's urban design . ultimately , the former tourist district of the city along falls street was destroyed . it went against the principles of several urban philosophers , such as jane jacobs , who claimed that mixed-use districts were needed -lrb- which the new downtown was not -rrb- and arteries needed to be kept open . smaller buildings also should be built or kept . in niagara falls , however , the convention center blocked traffic into the city , located in the center of falls street -lrb- the main artery -rrb- , and the wintergarden also blocked traffic from the convention center to the niagara falls .
theranos claimed that the allegations were `` factually and scientifically erroneous and grounded in baseless assertions by inexperienced and disgruntled former employees and industry incumbents '' . walgreens suspended plans to expand blood-testing centers in their stores following the report . at that time , the cleveland clinic announced that it would work to verify theranos technology . theranos fought back against the journal 's investigation , sending lawyers after sources in the story , including tyler shultz , in an effort to stop them from providing information to the press . in november 2010 walgreens filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against the wegmans supermarket chain , claiming the `` w '' in the wegman 's logo is too similar to walgreens ' . the lawsuit was settled in april 2011 , with wegmans agreeing to discontinue use of its `` w '' logo by june 2012 , although the supermarket retains the right to use the `` wegmans '' name in script . according to jo natale , wegmans director of media relations , `` the cost of making relatively minor changes to a limited number of products was much less than the cost of litigating this case to the end . '' the group 's headquarters , listed as being on baarerstrasse in zug , were revealed to be a post office box within the town 's post office . alliance boots itself stated that its swiss headquarters reflected the international nature of its wider group and that it had an administrative office in zurich . the guardian reported in 2016 the findings of richard brooks , a former tax inspector , who it said found that the `` headquarters '' in zug was `` one of around 50 unrelated companies dealt with by a local business service company , the proprietors of which were none too pleased with the visit '' and that no boots employees were present .
aysha al-daheri is standing on an airport runway a little after midnight . behind her , a c-17 military aircraft is being loaded up with 15 tons ' worth of aid bundles . al-daheri , the head of the united arab emirates medical support team in yemen , is wearing traditional garb instead of her usual military fatigues . she has led numerous , little-known emirati medical missions around the world , from bosnia to afghanistan . striking new drone images from the yemeni capital , sanaa , sheds light on the rarely accessible , rebel-held city , under siege for years and bombarded by airstrikes by the saudi-led coalition . the images were filmed in june by brazilian photojournalist gabriel chaim , who was given limited access by the houthi rebels who control the city , from where they unseated the yemeni government in 2015 . the footage shows the damage wrought to some of the buildings , but also its enduring beauty and how life goes on amid the rubble and carnage . the video was shot amid stalling peace talks to slow the siege of the vital port city of hodeidah . yemenis in the united kingdom include citizens and non-citizen immigrants in the united kingdom of yemeni ancestry , as well as their descendants . yemenis have been present in the uk since the 1860s , and are probably the longest-established muslim group in the country , although currently much smaller than some other british muslim groups .
it 's not clear if the boston marathon bombing suspects -- identified as brothers from the russian caucasus who moved to the united states several years ago -- were radicalized as a result of their ethnic chechen roots . but the question is bound to arise . whatever emerges about the brothers ' ties to russia 's north caucasus region it 's a part of the world that 's no stranger to violence or terrorism . the troubled region includes the russian republics of chechnya , dagestan , ingushetia , kabardino-balkaria and north ossetia . this morning the fbi is leading the investigation into the twin bombings at the boston marathon . overnight federal , state and local agencies searched an apartment in revere , massachusetts for possible clues . although they left with bags of evidence , there is no word on any arrests . the attack which occurred on monday left three people dead and over 150 people wounded . investigators are tracking down some two-thousand leads this morning in their search for information regarding the boston marathon bombings . there are also new reports this morning that boston-area hospitals have released at least 100 of the 183 people injured in monday 's attack . new details about the lives of the three people killed including a chinese graduate student who was studying at boston university are coming out as well . this morning congressman patrick meehan -lrb- r-pa -rrb- joins `` starting point . '' meehan serves as the chair of the house counterterrorism and intelligence subcommittee and was briefed about the boston marathon bombing on monday .
in 2002 , after winning a majority of seats in the state house of representatives , republicans gained complete control of the legislature . with the urging of governor rick perry and tom delay , who had assumed the position of us house majority leader in january 2003 , the republican majority introduced legislation to redraw the court-drawn districts from 2001 . as a check on the regional , popular , and rapidly changing politics of the house , the senate has several distinct powers . for example , the `` advice and consent '' powers -lrb- such as the power to approve treaties and confirm members of the cabinet -rrb- are a sole senate privilege . the house , however , has the exclusive power to initiate bills for raising revenue , to impeach officials , and to choose the president in the event that a presidential candidate fails to get a majority of the electoral college votes . the senate and house are further differentiated by term lengths and the number of districts represented : the senate has longer terms of six years , fewer members -lrb- currently one hundred , two for each state -rrb- , and -lrb- in all but seven delegations -rrb- larger constituencies per member . according to the constitution , the powers of both houses are nearly equal , with the consent of both houses needed to pass legislation . the difference mostly relates to taxation legislation . in practice , by convention , the person who can control a majority of votes in the lower house is invited by the governor-general to form the government . in practice that means that the leader of the party -lrb- or coalition of parties -rrb- with a majority of members in the house becomes the prime minister , who then can nominate other elected members of the government party in both the house and the senate to become ministers responsible for various portfolios and administer government departments .
for several decades , questions have been raised , especially in the usa and western europe , regarding the access of gays to catholic services as an indication of their non-discrimination . the church under pope john paul ii and cardinal ratzinger took the position based on the traditional magisterium of the catholic church , that while confirming respect for individuals , and showing `` great respect for these people who also suffer '' , gay wedding services are not to be tolerated in the church and that church facilities can not be made available for them . pope benedict xvi -lrb- latin : benedictus xvi ; italian : benedetto xvi ; german : benedikt xvi ; born joseph aloisius ratzinger ; german pronunciation : ; 16 april 1927 -rrb- is a retired prelate of the catholic church who served as head of the church and sovereign of the vatican city state from 2005 until his resignation in 2013 . benedict 's election as pope occurred in the 2005 papal conclave that followed the death of pope john paul ii . benedict chose to be known by the title `` pope emeritus '' upon his resignation.ordained as a priest in 1951 in his native bavaria , ratzinger had established himself as a highly regarded university theologian by the late 1950s and was appointed a full professor in 1958 . after a long career as an academic and professor of theology at several german universities , he was appointed archbishop of munich and freising and cardinal by pope paul vi in 1977 , an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience . bishops around the world have held diocesan events with the goal of reaching out to gay catholics and ministering to them , and more have spoken publicly about the need to love and welcome them into the church . pope john paul ii asked `` the bishops to support , with the means at their disposal , the development of appropriate forms of pastoral care for homosexual persons . '' several assemblies of the synod of bishops have struck similar themes , while maintaining that same-sex sexual activity is sinful and that same-sex marriage can not be permitted . in 2018 , in a move regarded as a sign of respect to the community , the vatican used the acronym lgbt for the first time in an official document . pope francis has also spoken out about the need for pastoral care for gay and transgender catholics , adding that god made lgbt people that way .
creating more economic opportunities will be mexico 's greatest weapon in the war on drugs , the country 's president-elect said tuesday . `` that , i think , is going to be the best way my government can prevent organized crime , '' president-elect enrique pena nieto told cnn 's wolf blitzer . without jobs and social programs , he said , `` millions of my countrymen have no other option than to dedicate themselves sometimes to criminal activity . '' the wide-ranging interview was recorded just a few hours before the incoming leader met with u.s. president barack obama in washington . the crowd at the base of the space needle in seattle began counting down as midnight approached . it was n't new year 's day they were anticipating , but the moment that marijuana would become legal in washington state . as midnight hit , smokers hit their pipes and joints to celebrate . technically , what they were doing -- smoking marijuana in public -- was still a crime , but police looked the other way . a new law legalizing recreational marijuana use in washington takes effect today . adults 21 and over are allowed to possess up to one ounce of marijuana , and while many in the state are lighting up and celebrating the law today , not everyone is supporting it . steve sarich is the executive director of the cannibis action coalition and runs a local dispensary for medical marijuana patients . he 's also the manager of the `` no on i-502 '' committee , which was the most vocal opponent of the washington law being passed .
orlando -lrb- -rrb- is a city in the u.s. state of florida and the county seat of orange county . located in central florida , it is the center of the orlando metropolitan area , which had a population of 2,509,831 , according to u.s. census bureau figures released in july 2017 . these figures make it the 23rd-largest metropolitan area in the united states , the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the southern united states , and the third-largest metropolitan area in florida . as of 2018 , orlando had an estimated city-proper population of 285,713 , making it the 71st-largest city in the united states , the fourth-largest city in florida , and the state 's largest inland city .
it was not until after passage by congress of the voting rights act of 1965 , the result of years of effort on the part of african americans and allies in the civil rights movement , that blacks within the southern states recovered their ability to exercise their rights to vote and to live with full civil rights . legal segregation ended . accomplishing voter registration and redistricting to implement the sense of the law took more time . this chart shows historical information on the salaries that members of the united states congress have been paid . the government ethics reform act of 1989 provides for an automatic increase in salary each year as a cost of living adjustment that reflects the employment cost index . since 2010 congress has annually voted not to accept the increase , keeping it at the same nominal amount since 2009 . the twenty-seventh amendment to the united states constitution , ratified in 1992 , prohibits any law affecting compensation from taking effect until after the next election . the united states congress is the bicameral legislature of the federal government of the united states , and consists of two chambers : the house of representatives and the senate . the congress meets in the united states capitol in washington , d.c. both senators and representatives are chosen through direct election , though vacancies in the senate may be filled by a gubernatorial appointment . congress has 535 voting members : 435 representatives and 100 senators .
in an article in the los angeles times , reporter valerie reitman credited helen burns , who had been part of the 2002 drive to designate the restaurant as a state historic landmark , with noticing the demolition around 5 p.m. on january 7 . the original kitchen and the back of the coffee shop had been demolished by the time burns arrived . she phoned the police and then began phoning other preservationists and car buffs , urging them to notify the police as well . harvey 's was featured in the nationally distributed magazine sports illustrated . in its 1961 issue , the author wrote `` a favorite in the los angeles area is harvey 's broiler , a drive-in in the suburb of downey . here high school hot rodders gather to partake of the glorified `` chubby , '' a double hamburger , gape at one another 's cars and check on the latest fads . on weekend nights hundreds of cars jam the parking lot , and eager drivers waiting for a berth circle the block . spillman 's black pickup truck matched the description of a vehicle seen in a parking lot near the victims ' home on the night of the murder . that evening spillman was stopped by an east wenatchee police officer in the parking lot of a vfw hall nearby . later a knife was recovered at that location . it was a 12-inch knife covered in blood and appeared to match a knife set in the victims ' home .
`` d-list '' -lrb- or sometimes z-list -rrb- is for a person whose celebrity is so obscure that they are generally only known for appearances as so-called celebrities on panel game shows and reality television . in the late 20th century , d-listers were largely ignored by the entertainment news industry ; for example , paul lynde , by this point in his career best known for being on the daytime game show hollywood squares , went largely unnoticed by the supermarket tabloids , and his homosexuality -lrb- which would have drawn attention for bigger celebrities -rrb- went largely unreported . kathy griffin , a u.s. comedian who became widely known for her frequent appearances on such programs , used the term in a tongue-in-cheek manner for her 2005 tv special the d-list and her 2005 tv series kathy griffin : my life on the d-list . it is also the lowest rating used by u.s. journalist james ulmer for his ulmer scale which ranks the bankability of 1,400 movie actors worldwide . on january 7 , 2012 , it was announced that -- along with having two more standup specials on bravo -- griffin will start a weekly one-hour talk show on the channel , kathy , which will consist of standup routines , `` rant about pop culture '' , and celebrity interviews . the first show aired on april 19 , 2012 , on bravo . griffin announced via twitter on july 26 , 2012 , that the show had been picked up for a second season . `` fight club '' is the twentieth episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series the x-files . it premiered on the fox network in the united states on may 7 , 2000 . it was written by series creator chris carter , directed by paul shapiro , and featured a guest appearance by kathy griffin . the episode plot serves as a `` monster-of-the-week '' story , which is unconnected to the series ' wider mythology .
after the funeral , the reagan entourage was flown back to the ronald w. reagan presidential library in simi valley , california , where another service was held , and president reagan was interred . at the time of his death , reagan was the longest-lived president in u.s. history , having lived 93 years and 120 days -lrb- 2 years , 8 months , and 23 days longer than john adams , whose record he surpassed -rrb- . he was also the first u.s. president to die in the 21st century . reagan 's burial site is inscribed with the words he delivered at the opening of the ronald reagan presidential library : `` i know in my heart that man is good , that what is right will always eventually triumph and that there is purpose and worth to each and every life . '' faced with concerns about the mounting federal debt , reagan agreed to raise taxes , signing the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 -lrb- tefra -rrb- . many of reagan 's conservative supporters condemned tefra , but reagan argued that his administration would be unable to win further budget cuts without the tax hike . among other provisions , tefra doubled the federal cigarette tax and rescinded a portion of the corporate tax cuts from the 1981 tax bill . by 1983 , the amount of federal tax had fallen for all or almost all american taxpayers , but most strongly affected the wealthy ; the proportion of income paid in taxes by the richest one percent fell from 29.8 percent to 24.8 percent . in 1946 , reagan served on the national board of directors for the independent citizens committee of the arts , sciences and professions -lrb- iccasp -rrb- and had been a member of its hollywood chapter . his attendance at a july 10 , 1946 , meeting of hiccasp brought him to the attention of the fbi , which interviewed him on april 10 , 1947 , in connection with its investigation into hiccasp . four decades later it was revealed that , during the late 1940s , reagan -lrb- under the code name t-10 -rrb- and his then-wife , jane wyman , provided the fbi with the names of actors within the motion picture industry whom they believed to be communist sympathizers . even so , he was uncomfortable with the way the sag was being used by the government , asking during one fbi interview , `` do they -lrb- ie .
the approval of the senate and the house of representatives is required for a bill to become law . both houses must pass the same version of the bill ; if there are differences , they may be resolved by a conference committee , which includes members of both bodies . for the stages through which bills pass in the senate , see act of congress . on april 19 , 2010 , the arizona house of representatives voted in favor of a rider to require presidential candidates `` to submit documents proving they meet the constitutional requirements to be president '' . if enacted , the law would give the arizona secretary of state the power to omit a candidate 's name on the state ballot if there is `` reasonable cause '' to believe that the documents are not adequate proof of the requirements for office . the rider passed the arizona house of representatives on a 31 -- 29 vote , with only republicans voting in favor and some republicans joining with democrats to oppose . the bill then went to the arizona state senate , which declined to vote on the bill before the april 2010 end of legislative session , the deadline for the bill 's passage . the representatives from the districts comprise at most 80 % of the members of the house ; therefore , for a party to have a majority of seats in the house , the party needs to win at least 60 % of the district seats . no party since the approval of the 1987 constitution has been able to win a majority of seats , hence coalitions are not uncommon .
mike huckabee appeared on the cbs evening news on august 1 to discuss the iowa straw poll and his ongoing campaign in iowa . he was among the republican debaters in iowa on august 5 , and came in with 8 percent support in a pre-debate poll , tying with john mccain and ahead of his main competitor sam brownback who came in with 5 percent . huckabee was pleased with the results , which showed that he was ahead of all of his second-tier candidates , and said `` we think a great sign for us because it shows that when other candidates are standing still or moving backwards we clearly are moving forward . '' an iowa focus group gave huckabee high marks after the debate , citing that he gave `` honest and clear answers '' to the questions . one day after appearing on stage with rowan county clerk kim davis , former arkansas gov. mike huckabee said he did not expect her to back down from her position on religious freedom and said the issue is the most important one in the 2016 election . `` i think the most important issue in the presidential election is : what do we believe the constitution teaches about the separation of powers , the distribution of powers ? '' huckabee told alisyn camerota on cnn 's `` new day '' on wednesday . huckabee starred in what pundits called the highlight of the new hampshire republican debate on september 5 , sparring with congressman ron paul in a heated exchange over the war in iraq and the united states ' obligation to the iraqi people . after paul stated that u.s. foreign policy is dragging the republican party down , huckabee responded , `` even if we lose elections , we should not lose our honor , and that is more important than the republican party . '' as the third quarter closed , huckabee was reported to have missed a major gop conference in michigan because his campaign could not afford a charter flight . huckabee rebounded his finances before the end of the third quarter , however , reporting $ 651,301 on hand .
gibson was banned from driving in ontario , canada for three months in 1984 , after rear-ending a car in toronto while under the influence of alcohol . he retreated to his australian farm for over a year to recover , but he continued to struggle with drinking . despite this problem , gibson gained a reputation in hollywood for professionalism and punctuality such that frequent collaborator richard donner was shocked when gibson confided that he was drinking five pints of beer for breakfast . reflecting in 2003 and 2004 , gibson said that despair in his mid-30s led him to contemplate suicide , and he meditated on christ 's passion to heal his wounds . before becoming involved with middlesbrough fc , gibson was the local labour party 's youngest ever councillor . although he retains a modest profile for such a popular football club chairman , gibson has occasionally raised his profile when commenting on the local political situation . he did so when working with middlesbrough 's elected mayor ray mallon in 2009 in the fight to save teesside 's steel industry . they accused the government and local labour mp 's of `` betrayal '' , with gibson quoted as saying : `` we have got five labour seats here . mel gibson has credited his directors , particularly george miller , peter weir , and richard donner , with teaching him the craft of filmmaking and influencing him as a director . according to robert downey , jr. , studio executives encouraged gibson in 1989 to try directing , an idea he rebuffed at the time . gibson made his directorial debut in 1993 with the man without a face , followed two years later by braveheart , which earned gibson the academy award for best director . gibson had long planned to direct a remake of fahrenheit 451 , but in 1999 the project was indefinitely postponed because of scheduling conflicts .
impressed with his rapid rise in the ratings , wwdc management offered stern an initial one-year extension to his contract , but stern wished for a more long-term deal . at the same time , he was offered a five-year deal worth $ 1 million to work afternoons at wnbc in new york city , then an adult contemporary station , after radio manager jerry nachman became a fan of stern and suggested his name to the station . stern signed with wnbc in march 1982 , four months before his contract with wwdc was to expire . his relationship with station management declined there on , and repeatedly criticized them and other deejays on the air , including an incident whereby he revealed the manager 's salary . on december 16 , 2000 , stern 's last live radio show of the year , he announced the signing of his new contract with infinity broadcasting to continue his show for five years after four months of negotiations . forbes estimated his new earnings ranged between $ 17 million and $ 20 million a year . stern spoke at the concert for new york city in october 2001 in a hazmat suit with his buttocks exposed similarly to his 1992 mtv music video awards appearance . in november 2001 , stern 's production company had begun development on a weekly television sitcom titled kane for cbs , originally intended to replace the howard stern radio show following its cancellation , with ron zimmerman as the writer of its pilot episode . in 2015 and 2016 , the new york times and the washington post addressed changes in the show 's direction , with an emphasis on celebrity interviews and change in tone . the new york times wrote : `` scattered among the gleefully vulgar mainstays are now long , starkly intimate live exchanges -- character excavations that have made mr. stern one of the most deft and engrossing celebrity interviewers in the business and a sought-after stop for stars selling a movie or setting the record straight . '' amongst the changes to the show , some wack pack members have been given less offensive names ; wendy the retard was renamed wendy the slow adult . during an interview with madonna , stern said of his earlier years in radio , `` i used to say bad things about everybody ...
america may be in for some tough love from the pope . after a lifetime of watching the world 's most affluent and powerful nation from afar , pope francis walked on u.s. soil for the first time tuesday , at the age of 78 , when he arrived in washington from cuba . he 's assured of a warm welcome from millions of u.s. catholics , and his poll numbers -- which would be the envy of any politician -- suggest that curious adherents of other faiths and even the nondevout are also eagerly awaiting his visit . but the first latin american pope 's blessings on america could also contain uncomfortable challenges as he addresses a country that encapsulates many of the ills he has denounced as the head of one of the world 's largest religions . this just in : yes , the pope is still catholic . aboard the papal plane bound for the united states on tuesday , a journalist asked pope francis about perceptions that his catholic bona fides are in question , mainly because of his sharp critiques of capitalism . the pope said he `` may have given the impression of being a little more to the left , but it would not be a correct interpretation . '' `` my doctrine ... this is the social doctrine of the church . as pope francis prepares to visit the united states for the first time , the world is waiting to hear what he will say about key issues facing the church . the pope is known for tackling sensitive topics head on . but for all his surprises and proclamations , what has pope francis done to address the issues facing the roman catholic church ? sex abuse `` i feel compelled to take personal responsibility for all the evil that some priests , many -- many in number , -lrb- although -rrb- not in comparison with the totality -- to assume personal responsibility and to ask forgiveness for the damage caused by the sexual abuse of the children .
it is funding the foundation for a smoke-free world -lrb- founded in 2017 -rrb- to purportedly fund scientific research for the global elimination of tobacco smoking and has adopted a goal of making cigarettes obsolete by 2035 . its claims to independence have been challenged and it has been criticised by the campaign for tobacco-free kids , action on smoking and health -lrb- ash -rrb- , and corporate accountability international . the american cancer society stated , `` this attempt by philip morris international to paint itself as a public health partner is manipulative and dangerous . it is a new twist out of the tobacco industry 's deadly playbook , but nobody should be fooled . philip morris international inc. -lrb- pmi -rrb- is a swiss-domiciled multinational cigarette and tobacco manufacturing company , with products sold in over 180 countries . it is headquartered in neuchâtel , switzerland . the most recognized and best selling product of the company is marlboro.until a spin-off in march 2008 , philip morris international was an operating company of altria . altria explained the spin-off , arguing pmi would have more `` freedom '' outside the constraints of us corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to `` pursue sales growth in emerging markets '' , while altria focuses on the united states . philip morris sold the canadian rights to the `` marlboro '' name to imperial tobacco canada in 1932 . after the brand 's successful american relaunch in the 1950s -- which later became well known to canadians through exposure to the brand 's international sponsorships and advertising -- philip morris tried several legal manoeuvres in attempting to reacquire the canadian rights , to no avail . imperial tobacco continues to sell a line of cigarettes under the marlboro name in canada , albeit with very different packaging from that of the philip morris product . philip morris retains the rights to the `` rooftop '' trade dress and other elements of marlboro 's branding which were developed after the 1932 sale , and has historically used that trade dress in canada in combination with the names `` matador '' or occasionally `` maverick '' for a line of virginia blend cigarettes .
the midwestern united states , also referred to as the american midwest , middle west , or simply the midwest , is one of four census regions of the united states census bureau -lrb- also known as `` region 2 '' -rrb- . it occupies the northern central part of the united states . it was officially named the north central region by the census bureau until 1984 . it is located between the northeastern united states and the western united states , with canada to its north and the southern united states to its south . we 're a nation of can-do people : we work , we plan , we organize , we go , fueling ourselves on coffee and pure determination . until , that is , we fall onto the sofa in a stupor . more of us are struggling with energy issues , experts say ; they point to the weak economy , which has us working harder and plugging in longer , and the belief that we can have it all -lrb- so what if we 're up till midnight making it happen ? -rrb- . `` i 'm seeing so many women who think of themselves as machines that can run nonstop , and they 're living with this deep fatigue , '' says psychologist michelle segar , associate director of the sport , health , and activity research and policy center for women and girls at the university of michigan .
senate republicans find themselves boxed-in in the wake of president donald trump 's renewed attacks on the late sen. john mccain , unwilling to strongly stand up to a president who is widely popular with gop base voters but still deeply uncomfortable with his criticism of the late war hero and , for many in the chamber , a friend . that fine line republicans are walking was on display this week when only a few of them weighed in on trump 's sustained assault on mccain and those who did speak out issued tepid statements that praised mccain 's military and political service to the country but stopped short of criticizing trump for his harsh rhetoric . the clearest example of this came from sen. lindsey graham , a south carolina republican , who is known as mccain 's soul mate in the senate but who is also up for re-election in 2020 and in need of trump 's continued political backing . speaking in a subdued voice , he told wlos tv in spartanburg wednesday that he is not happy with trump 's attacks on mccain but that , `` i 'll try to continue to help the president . '' republican sen. lindsey graham is stuck once again between a president whose support he needs to win re-election and his lifelong friendship with the late arizona sen. john mccain , who encouraged all to put country first . but time and political necessity have softened graham 's public grievances with president donald trump . the presidential embrace has been months in the making . beginning with golf outings with trump , graham now frequently takes calls from the president . in his latest attack on john mccain , president donald trump accused the late senator of misleading the white house about his vote on a gop effort to repeal the affordable care act in 2017 after spending years campaigning on repealing it . facts first : trump falsely accused mccain of misleading the white house over his intention to vote on the gop drafted bill to repeal obamacare -- but mccain on several occasions publicly expressed his opposition prior to the vote . mccain did , however , campaign on repealing it . mccain 's actions in the days , and even the hours leading up to his dramatic decision to come down against the republican attempt to undo the law known as obamacare , call into question trump 's version of events leading up to the vote .
whatever vladimir putin 's goal is in a year-long campaign of apparent cyberattacks against the us political system , the russian leader has accomplished this much : tying the us government in knots over what to do about it . there 's debate in the obama administration about how to respond to the hacks targeting democratic party organizations and increasing evidence that russian hackers also were behind attacks on election registration websites . fbi and justice department officials believe there 's strong evidence to warrant publicly naming russia as responsible for the political organization attacks , law enforcement and intelligence officials briefed on the investigation say . but there is opposition from us intelligence agencies and the office of the director of national intelligence , who have cautioned about moving to `` name and shame '' russia , in part because of concerns about russian retaliation and the possible exposure of us intelligence operations , the routine spy work that the us carries out against russia and other countries . the great reality tv swindle -lrb- also known as project ms-2 -rrb- was a con perpetrated in 2002 by nik russian , a british man who , at the time , was working at an entry-level position in a branch of the uk book chain waterstone 's . russian placed advertisements in major publications that invited people to audition for a year-long reality television programme where they could potentially win a prize of gb £ 100,000 . after receiving hundreds of responses , he auditioned some of them on raven 's ait in london , then selected 30 successful auditionees to take part , without informing them that no actual program had been commissioned . telling them that the show would last for an entire year , russian instructed the participants to leave their homes , quit their jobs and then meet him in london on 10 june , where they would be divided into teams of ten and set their challenge for the next twelve months . donald trump gave an interview thursday that aired on a television station funded by the kremlin , arguing that the russian government was `` probably '' not meddling in the american presidential race . speaking to larry king on rt america , which is an arm of government-funded news outlet russia today , trump said it would `` not be appropriate '' if russian forces were looking to influence the race , which is suspected by some investigators and has been fanned by hillary clinton 's campaign as recently as thursday morning . he also suggested that the allegation was politically motivated . `` i think it 's probably unlikely .
sometimes emergency supplies are kept in what is called a bug-out bag . while fema does not actually use the term `` bug out bag , '' calling it instead some variation of a `` go kit , '' the idea of having emergency items in a quickly accessible place is common to both fema and cdc , though on-line discussions of what items a `` bug out bag '' should include sometimes cover items such as firearms and great knives that are not specifically suggested by fema or cdc . the theory behind a `` bug out bag '' is that emergency preparations should include the possibility of emergency evacuation . whether fleeing a burning building or hastily packing a car to escape an impending hurricane , flood or dangerous chemical release , rapid departure from a home or workplace environment is always a possibility and fema suggests having a family emergency plan for such occasions . fema also operates a building science branch that develops and produces multi-hazard mitigation guidance that focuses on creating disaster-resilient communities to reduce loss of life and property . fema advises citizens to prepare their homes with some emergency essentials in the case that the food distribution lines are interrupted . fema has subsequently prepared for this contingency by purchasing hundreds of thousands of freeze dried food emergency meals ready to eat -lrb- mre 's -rrb- to dispense to the communities where emergency shelter and evacuations are implemented . the response phase of an emergency may commence with search and rescue but in all cases the focus will quickly turn to fulfilling the basic humanitarian needs of the affected population . this assistance may be provided by national or international agencies and organizations . effective coordination of disaster assistance is often crucial , particularly when many organizations respond and local emergency management agency -lrb- lema -rrb- capacity has been exceeded by the demand or diminished by the disaster itself . the national response framework is a united states government publication that explains responsibilities and expectations of government officials at the local , state , federal , and tribal levels .
republicans are acting as if they are in a state of shock about their nominee . from the moment that the tape of donald trump and billy bush discussing women in vulgar terms surfaced on friday , republicans have been coming out of the woodwork to denounce his words , trying to separate themselves from his campaign . the republican national committee sent out an email to vendors saying they should put a `` hold on all projects '' in a mailing program devoted to electing trump . sen. john mccain , who had backed trump even though he had mocked his having been captured in war , has now withdrawn his support . the republican party is in a meltdown unlike anything it has experienced in modern times -- and it 's unfolding just one month before election day . many in the gop are reeling from shock , revulsion and utter confusion about what to do next after a video surfaced friday of donald trump talking about women in crude and aggressive sexual terms . new revelations emerged saturday after cnn 's kfile reviewed hours of newly uncovered audio of demeaning conversations trump held over a 17-year period with radio shock-jock howard stern . the topics discussed included his daughter ivanka 's physique , having sex with women during their menstrual cycles , threesomes , and checking out of relationships with women after they turn 35 . donald trump -- struggling to move past a week of one controversy after another -- is making clear that he 's willing to go it alone in the final weeks of the campaign . as the republican nominee tries to recover from one of his toughest stretches , few prominent gop leaders -- other than those who advise him or are on his payroll -- seem willing to launch a full-throated rescue effort . so trump sought to do the heavy lifting himself monday , delivering a feisty speech here that attempted to reframe the campaign and extract him from the quagmire of the past week , which included a disappointing debate performance , a roiling controversy over whether he paid taxes , and ill-advised attacks on a latina beauty queen -- a feud he could n't seem to let go . trump running out of time as controversies pile up with a new cnn/orc poll showing democratic nominee hillary clinton with a five-point lead over trump after the debate , trump for the first time seemed to relish the role of underdog in the presidential race .
the following month pope benedict xvi took another step to placate anger in the islamic world over his remarks on holy war , making additions to his original text affirming that a quotation from a 14th-century byzantine emperor was not his personal opinion . the original said the emperor 's remark was made `` somewhat brusquely '' . in the new version , it says it was made with `` a brusqueness that we find unacceptable . '' benedict added in a footnote : `` in the muslim world , this quotation has unfortunately been taken as an expression of my personal position , thus arousing understandable indignation . on november 10 , 2006 , pope benedict urged his fellow german catholics to discuss their faith in jesus christ openly with the muslims living there . the pontiff said the roman catholic church viewed muslims `` with respect and good will . they mostly hold on to their religious convictions and rites with great seriousness and have a right to see our humble and strong witness for jesus christ '' , he said after noting that modern german society had been largely secularized . `` to do this convincingly , we need to make serious efforts . the prayer in istanbul 's blue mosque was `` not initially planned but it turned out to be very meaningful '' . it was a prayer to the `` one lord of heaven and earth , merciful father of all mankind '' . addressing today 's general audience , this was how benedict xvi described his silent prayer on 30 november in istanbul . the pope `` thanked divine providence for this '' and said : `` may all believers identify themselves with the one god and bear witness to true brotherhood . '' the pontiff augured that turkey `` will be a bridge of friendship and collaboration between east and west '' and he thanked the turkish people `` for the cordiality and sympathy '' they showed him throughout his stay , when `` he felt loved and understood '' .
although barton speaks frequently about his desire to help create `` a new , living theater , of and about and for the common man '' , he does not recognize that such a theater has already been created : the films . in fact , he disdains this authentically popular form . on the other hand , the world of broadway theatre in barton fink is a place of high culture , where the creator believes most fully that his work embodies his own values . although he pretends to disdain his own success , barton believes he has achieved a great victory with bare ruined choirs . upon her return , her family relocated to help a family member : a paternal cousin of clara 's had died and left his wife with four children and a farm . the house that the barton family was to live in needed to be painted and repaired . barton was persistent in offering assistance , much to the gratitude of her family . after the work was done , barton was at a loss because she had nothing else to help with , to not feel like a burden to her family . barton does not believe hollywood offers the same opportunity . in the film , los angeles is a world of false fronts and phony people . this is evident in an early line of the screenplay -lrb- filmed , but not included in the theatrical release -rrb- ; while informing barton of capitol pictures ' offer , his agent tells him : `` i 'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism -- if i can use that word and hollywood in the same breath '' . later , as barton tries to explain why he is staying at the earle , studio head jack lipnick finishes his sentence , recognizing that barton wants a place that is `` less hollywood '' .
niles was born in brookfield , wisconsin , a suburb of milwaukee , and his family moved to nashotah , a small town to the north , when he was twelve years old . niles developed an interest in heroic fantasy , as well as wargaming , and began writing short stories and making short films in high school . niles attended the university of wisconsin at oshkosh , where he majored in speech and minored in english . while there , he met chris schroeder , whom he married three years later . after graduation , niles began teaching speech and english at clinton -lrb- wis. -rrb- high school , about 30 miles away from lake geneva , wisconsin . `` one day , one of my students came up and said she had a note to get out of class that afternoon because she was going to be interviewed by people magazine . her name was heidi gygax . i asked her why people wanted to interview her , and she told me that her father had invented the dungeons & dragons game . hester was the inspiration for both frasier and niles to go into the profession . she named her two sons after favorite lab rats . both her sons take after her more than they do their father , being intellectually pompous , which causes roz and martin -- especially given her infidelity -- to consider that hester 's one-time lab assistant leland barton -lrb- david ogden stiers -rrb- might be the boys ' biological father . -lrb- without knowing martin 's concerns , barton reveals he is gay , implying he is not their father . -rrb-
back home , at a party one night , ann is stunned when her grown daughter turns up with peter as her date . peter was not her daughter 's date - he picked her up at her home in place of her daughter 's date . it turns out , however , that peter 's goal is to resume his romantic acquaintance with ann , having developed feelings for her during the summer . the age difference embarrasses ann greatly . the name `` barnes dance '' commemorates traffic engineer henry barnes . while he did not claim to have invented it himself , barnes was a strong advocate of it , having observed the difficulties his daughter experienced on her way to school . he first introduced it in his home city of denver , colorado in the late 1940s . around this time , the pedestrian scramble was being tested separately in kansas city and vancouver . in his autobiography the man with the red and green eyes -lrb- 1965 -rrb- barnes recorded that a city hall reporter , john buchanan , first coined the phrase by writing that `` barnes has made the people so happy they 're dancing in the streets . '' barnes later said , `` as things stood now , a downtown shopper needed a four-leaf clover , a voodoo charm , and a st. christopher 's medal to make it in one piece from one curbstone to the other . as far as i was concerned -- a traffic engineer with methodist leanings -- i did n't think that the almighty should be bothered with problems which we , ourselves , were capable of solving . ''
through the carbon war room , founded in 2009 , the entrepreneur sought solutions for global warming and the energy crisis . `` we all have a part to play , but i believe entrepreneurs will have a really significant role to play in bringing investment and commercial skills to help develop the new technologies needed to grow a post-carbon economy '' , he said in his interview with vision . through carbon war room initiative he has focused efforts on finding sustainable alternatives for three industry sectors : shipping , energy efficiency and aviation and renewable jet fuels . on 9 february 2007 , branson announced the setting up of a new global science and technology prize -- the virgin earth challenge -- in the belief that history has shown that prizes of this nature encourage technological advancements for the good of mankind . the virgin earth challenge was to award $ 25 million to the individual or group who are able to demonstrate a commercially viable design that will result in the net removal of anthropogenic , atmospheric greenhouse gases each year for at least ten years without countervailing harmful effects . this removal must have long-term effects and contribute materially to the stability of the earth 's climate . branson also announced that he would be joined in the adjudication of the prize by a panel of five judges , all world authorities in their respective fields : al gore , sir crispin tickell , tim flannery , james e. hansen , and james lovelock . branson 's next venture with the virgin group was virgin fuels , which was set up to respond to global warming and exploit the recent spike in fuel costs by offering a revolutionary , cheaper fuel for automobiles and , in the near future , aircraft . branson has stated that he was formerly a global warming sceptic and was influenced in his decision by a breakfast meeting with al gore .
taylor found there was `` no provision '' for controlling the entry of spectators into the turnstile area . he dismissed the claim by senior police officers that they had no reason to anticipate problems , since congestion had occurred at both the 1987 and 1988 semi-finals . he said that `` the operational order and police tactics on the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival of large numbers should that occur in a short period . that it might so occur was foreseeable '' . writing for rolling stone , peter travers gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars , saying : `` as a director , franco succeeds beautifully at bringing coherence to chaos , a word that accurately describes the making of this modern midnight-movie phenomenon . do you need to see the room to appreciate the disaster artist ? not really . '' justin chang of the los angeles times called the film `` a hilarious , heartening celebration of failure '' . manohla dargis of the new york times wrote that it is `` a divertingly funny movie , but its breeziness can also feel overstated , at times glib and a bit of a dodge '' . peter bradshaw of the guardian gave the film three out of five stars , writing that the film brings up unanswered questions , and that it `` has room for improvement '' . ignatiy vishnevetsky of the a.v. club gave the film a rating of `` c '' , calling it a `` lousy tribute '' and asking , `` will anyone who has n't seen the room actually be able to piece together a sense of this z-grade sensation from watching the disaster artist ? ''
the united states of america -lrb- usa -rrb- , commonly known as the united states -lrb- u.s. or us -rrb- or america , is a country comprising 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . at 3.8 million square miles -lrb- 9.8 million km2 -rrb- , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of europe . most of the country is located in central north america between canada and mexico . with an estimated population of over 328 million , the u.s. is the third most populous country .
mccain was publicly skeptical about the republican strategy that precipitated the u.s. federal government shutdown of 2013 and u.s. debt-ceiling crisis of 2013 in order to defund or delay the affordable care act ; in october 2013 he voted in favor of the continuing appropriations act , 2014 , which resolved them and said , `` republicans have to understand we have lost this battle , as i predicted weeks ago , that we would not be able to win because we were demanding something that was not achievable . '' similarly , he was one of nine republican senators who voted for the bipartisan budget act of 2013 at the end of the year . by early 2014 , mccain 's apostasies were enough that the arizona republican party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been `` disastrous and harmful '' . mccain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of obama 's foreign policy , however , and in june 2014 , following major gains by the islamic state in iraq and the levant in the 2014 northern iraq offensive , decried what he saw as a u.s. failure to protect its past gains in iraq and called on the president 's entire national security team to resign . while control of the house of representatives went over to the republicans in the 112th congress , the senate stayed democratic and mccain continued to be the ranking member of the senate armed services committee . as the arab spring took center stage , mccain urged that the embattled egyptian president , hosni mubarak , step down and thought the u.s. should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power . mccain was an especially vocal supporter of the 2011 military intervention in libya . in april of that year he visited the anti-gaddafi forces and national transitional council in benghazi , the highest-ranking american to do so , and said that the rebel forces were `` my heroes '' . the severity of her husband 's illness led to the possibility that he would not be able to finish his term in office and that the governor of arizona would have to appoint a successor until a special election could be held . there is a tradition in such situations for politically involved spouses to be named as replacements , a practice known as `` widow 's succession '' . the possibility became an issue in the 2018 arizona gubernatorial election , where in the republican primary contest incumbent governor doug ducey was trying to fend off a challenge from former secretary of state of arizona ken bennett . in may 2018 , some media reports stated that ducey was planning on naming mccain if the seat became vacant .
in november 1982 , compaq announced their first product , the compaq portable , a portable ibm pc compatible personal computer . it was released in march 1983 at $ 2995 , considerably more affordable than the canadian hyperion . the compaq portable was one of the progenitors of today 's laptop ; some called it a `` suitcase computer '' for its size and the look of its case . it was the second ibm pc compatible , being capable of running all software that would run on an ibm pc . the machine uses a unique hybrid of the ibm mda and cga which supports the latter 's graphics modes , but contains both cards ' text fonts in rom . when using the internal monochrome monitor the 9x14 font is used , and the 8x8 one when an external monitor is used -lrb- the user switches between internal and external monitors by pressing ctrl + alt + > -rrb- . the user can use both ibm video standards , for graphics capabilities and high-resolution text . with a larger external monitor , the graphics hardware is also used in the original compaq deskpro desktop computer . presario was a series of desktop computers and notebooks from compaq . the presario family of computers was launched for the consumer marketplace in september 1993 . in the mid-1990s , compaq began manufacturing pc monitors as part of the presario brand . a series of all-in one units , containing both the pc and the monitor in the same case , were also released .
we do not have this sort of event happening everyday . but at the same time , we know that the code of canon law promulgated in 1983 , makes provision for the resignation of the pope , if he becomes incapacitated or , as with benedict xvi , if he believes he is no longer able to effectively carry out his official functions as head of the roman catholic church due to a decline in his physical ability . this is not the first time that a pope would resign . in fact , we have had not less than three who resigned , including pope celestine v in 1294 and pope gregory xii in 1415 . pope benedict xvi -lrb- latin : benedictus xvi ; italian : benedetto xvi ; german : benedikt xvi ; born joseph aloisius ratzinger ; german pronunciation : ; 16 april 1927 -rrb- is a retired prelate of the catholic church who served as head of the church and sovereign of the vatican city state from 2005 until his resignation in 2013 . benedict 's election as pope occurred in the 2005 papal conclave that followed the death of pope john paul ii . benedict chose to be known by the title `` pope emeritus '' upon his resignation.ordained as a priest in 1951 in his native bavaria , ratzinger had established himself as a highly regarded university theologian by the late 1950s and was appointed a full professor in 1958 . after a long career as an academic and professor of theology at several german universities , he was appointed archbishop of munich and freising and cardinal by pope paul vi in 1977 , an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience . on 2 january 2005 , time magazine quoted unnamed vatican sources as saying that ratzinger was a front runner to succeed john paul ii should he die or become too ill to continue as pope . on the death of john paul ii , the financial times gave the odds of ratzinger becoming pope as 7 -- 1 , the lead position , but close to his rivals on the liberal wing of the church . in april 2005 , before his election as pope , he was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by time . while prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , ratzinger repeatedly stated he would like to retire to his house in the bavarian village of pentling near regensburg and dedicate himself to writing books .
the moon was first reached by a human-made object in september 1959 , when the soviet union 's luna 2 , an unmanned spacecraft , was intentionally crashed onto the lunar surface . this accomplishment was followed by the first successful soft landing on the moon by luna 9 in 1966 . the united states ' nasa apollo program achieved the only manned lunar missions to date , beginning with the first manned orbital mission by apollo 8 in 1968 , and six manned landings between 1969 and 1972 , with the first being apollo 11 in july 1969 . these missions returned lunar rocks which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the moon 's origin , internal structure , and the moon 's later history . in 2009 , nasa 's robotic lunar reconnaissance orbiter , while orbiting 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 mi -rrb- above the moon , began photographing the remnants of the apollo program left on the lunar surface , and photographed each site where crewed apollo flights landed . all of the u.s. flags left on the moon during the apollo missions were found to still be standing , with the exception of the one left during the apollo 11 mission , which was blown over during that mission 's lift-off from the lunar surface and return to the mission command module in lunar orbit ; the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown . after the apollo 11 mission , officials from the soviet union said landing humans on the moon was dangerous and unnecessary . at the time the soviet union was attempting to retrieve lunar samples robotically . the soviets publicly denied there was a race to the moon , and indicated they were not making an attempt . mstislav keldysh said in july 1969 , `` we are concentrating wholly on the creation of large satellite systems .

seth d. harris -lrb- born october 12 , 1962 -rrb- was the 11th united states deputy secretary of labor , and served for six months as the acting u.s. secretary of labor and a member of president barack obama 's cabinet . nominated by president obama in february 2009 , harris was unanimously confirmed by the u.s. senate in may 2009 , and became acting secretary of labor following the resignation of hilda solis in january 2013 . harris was also a member of the overseas private investment corporation 's board of directors . harris stepped down from his post on january 16 , 2014 . the square mile -lrb- abbreviated as sq mi and sometimes as mi ² -rrb- is an imperial and us unit of measure for an area equal to the area of a square with a side length of one statute mile . it should not be confused with miles square , which refers to a square region with each side having the specified length . for instance , 20 miles square -lrb- 20 × 20 miles -rrb- has an area equal to 400 square miles ; a rectangle of 10 × 40 miles likewise has an area of 400 square miles , but it is not 20 miles square . one square mile is equal to : 4,014,489,600 square inches27 ,878,400 square feet3 ,097,600 square yards640 acres2560 roodssince one inch has been standardized to 2.54 cm by international agreement , a square mile is equivalent to the following metric measures : 25,899,881,103.36 square centimetres2 ,589,988.110336 square metres258 .9988110336 hectares2 .589988110336 square kilometreswhen applied to a portion of the earth 's surface , `` square mile '' is an informal synonym for section . the atlantic ocean is the second largest of the world 's oceans , with an area of about 106,460,000 square kilometers -lrb- 41,100,000 square miles -rrb- . it covers approximately 20 percent of earth 's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area . it separates the `` old world '' from the `` new world '' . the atlantic ocean occupies an elongated , s-shaped basin extending longitudinally between europe and africa to the east , and the americas to the west .
at certain points in time , yue fei ceased to be a national hero , such as in 2002 , when the official guidelines for history teachers said that he could no longer carry the title . this was because yue fei had defended china from the jurchen people , who are presently considered to be a part of the chinese nation . therefore , concern for the `` unity of nationalities '' in china prevailed , as yue fei was seen as representing only one subgroup within china , and not the `` entire chinese nation as presently defined '' . however , both the chinese ministry of education and the minister of defence deny such claims and still clearly address yue fei as a national hero of china . shuo yue quanzhuan states after having yue fei , yue yun , zhang xian arrested under false charges , qin hui and his wife , lady wang -lrb- 王氏 -rrb- , were sitting by the `` eastern window '' , warming themselves by the fire , when he received a letter from the people calling for the release of yue fei . qin was worried because after nearly two months of torture , he could not get yue to admit to treason and would eventually have to let him go . however , after a servant girl brought fresh oranges into the room , lady wang devised a plan to execute yue . she told qin to slip an execution notice inside the skin of an orange and send it to the judge presiding over yue 's case . twin newborn girls allegedly stolen by a maternity doctor in a baby trafficking scandal in northwest china were returned to their parents over the weekend . surrounded by reporters and photographers , police handed the two infants back to their parents at fuping county hospital in shaanxi province late on saturday . the twins ' father , qi kunfeng , presented a banner to thank police for recovering the babies , while their mother , wang yanyan , wept . `` they 're all healthy and well .
the prospect of virginia gov. bob mcdonnell resigning as he copes with a federal investigation into the nearly $ 150,000 worth of lavish gifts the republican and his family received from a wealthy executive is unlikely , people close to the governor insist . yet the topic remains a tantalizing conversation piece around richmond these days , mainly because it would be an act without modern precedent . while virginia has had its fair share of tumultuous politics over the years , not since reconstruction has the commonwealth been forced to grapple with a question of succession . virginia johnson , the pioneering sex researcher who was part of the groundbreaking team masters and johnson , has died at age 88 , her son , scott johnson , told cnn on wednesday . johnson died tuesday morning in st. louis of natural causes , though she had some complications from heart disease , he said . dr. william masters and johnson conducted the first modern research on sexuality and the treatment of sexual dysfunction that paved the way for the sexual revolution . the pair wrote several books , starting with `` human sexual response '' in 1966 , a landmark work discussing the physiology of sex . duncan was the first sitting conservative mp voluntarily to acknowledge that he is gay ; he did this in an interview with the times on 29 july 2002 , although he has said that this came as no surprise to friends . indeed , in an editorial published on the news of duncan 's coming out , the daily telegraph reported , `` the news that alan duncan is gay will come as a surprise only to those who have never met him . the bantam tory frontbencher can hardly be accused of having hidden his homosexuality . ''
`` a crucial problem is that we do not know much about the underlying empirical micro-processes that lead to the emergence of the typical network characteristics of big data '' . in their critique , snijders , matzat , and reips point out that often very strong assumptions are made about mathematical properties that may not at all reflect what is really going on at the level of micro-processes . mark graham has leveled broad critiques at chris anderson 's assertion that big data will spell the end of theory : focusing in particular on the notion that big data must always be contextualized in their social , economic , and political contexts . even as companies invest eight - and nine-figure sums to derive insight from information streaming in from suppliers and customers , less than 40 % of employees have sufficiently mature processes and skills to do so . much in the same line , it has been pointed out that the decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitably `` informed by the world as it was in the past , or , at best , as it currently is '' . fed by a large number of data on past experiences , algorithms can predict future development if the future is similar to the past . if the system 's dynamics of the future change -lrb- if it is not a stationary process -rrb- , the past can say little about the future . in order to make predictions in changing environments , it would be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the systems dynamic , which requires theory . this situation often arises when seeking knowledge about the cause system of which the observed population is an outcome . in such cases , sampling theory may treat the observed population as a sample from a larger ` superpopulation ' . for example , a researcher might study the success rate of a new ` quit smoking ' program on a test group of 100 patients , in order to predict the effects of the program if it were made available nationwide . here the superpopulation is `` everybody in the country , given access to this treatment '' -- a group which does not yet exist , since the program is n't yet available to all .

religion continued to feature prominently in how schneider covered the occupy movement . according to nick pinto of al jazeera america , `` schneider 's education and much of his writing are concerned with religion , and he relies heavily on christian vocabulary to describe his experience in occupy wall street .

disney also hired outside producers for film projects , which had never been done before in the studio 's history . in 1979 , disney entered a joint venture with paramount pictures on the production of the 1980 film adaptation of popeye and dragonslayer -lrb- 1981 -rrb- ; the first time disney collaborated with another studio . paramount distributed disney films in canada at the time , and it was hoped that disney 's marketing prestige would help sell the two films . finally , in 1982 , the disney family sold the naming rights and rail-based attractions to the disney film studio for 818,461 shares of disney stock then worth $ 42.6 million none of which went to retlaw . the military films generated only enough revenue to cover costs , and the feature film bambi -- which had been in production since 1937 -- underperformed on its release in april 1942 , and lost $ 200,000 at the box office . on top of the low earnings from pinocchio and fantasia , the company had debts of $ 4 million with the bank of america in 1944 . at a meeting with bank of america executives to discuss the future of the company , the bank 's chairman and founder , amadeo giannini , told his executives , `` i 've been watching the disneys ' pictures quite closely because i knew we were lending them money far above the financial risk . ... walt disney world received much of the company 's attention through the 1970s and into the 1980s . in 1978 , disney executives announced plans for the second walt disney world theme park , epcot center , which would open in october 1982 . inspired by walt disney 's dream of a futuristic model city , epcot center was built as a `` permanent world 's fair '' , complete with exhibits sponsored by major american corporations , as well as pavilions based on the cultures of other nations . in japan , the oriental land company partnered with walt disney productions to build the first disney theme park outside of the united states , tokyo disneyland , which opened in april 1983 .
the music video for `` you 're beautiful '' was directed by brandon smith . at least one writer 's interpretation is that it shows blunt taking his own life , perhaps following a japanese tradition of removing one 's shoes and contents of clothing prior to jumping from a great height . however , the director of the video states in a `` making-of '' piece of footage that `` he idea is built around the last line , where he says , ` i 'll never be with you ' , and that idea of completely forgetting about something , of getting rid of that emotion , and moving on , and i think that the video is a sort of visual manifestation of that emotion . '' due to the favourable reception of blunt 's previous single `` you 're beautiful '' , `` goodbye my lover '' debuted on the u.s. billboard hot 100 singles chart at number 100 , even though it had not been released as a single in the u.s. . the single appeared on the chart backed solely on the strength of digital sales after a re-run of an episode of saturday night live that featured blunt performing the song . it later re-entered the billboard hot 100 , again due to digital downloads , as a result of blunt 's performance of the song on the oprah winfrey show . newspapers have claimed that `` you 're beautiful '' is about a former girlfriend of blunt , dixie chassay , casting assistant for the harry potter films , although blunt refuses to confirm nor deny this . on 8 march 2006 on the oprah winfrey show , blunt said of the song , `` it 's kind of miserable . it was about seeing my ex-girlfriend on the underground in london with her new man , who i did n't know existed . she and i caught eyes and lived a lifetime in that moment , but did n't do anything about it and have n't seen each other since .

'' , refuting the potential defense that trump had not been involved , and that sondland might have been acting without the president 's knowledge . further , holmes ' deposition raised questions about the credibility , accuracy , and truthfulness of ambassador sondland 's previous sworn deposition , furthering the possibility that sondland either perjured himself or needed to clarify his original sworn statement .

flegenheimer was released on parole on december 8 , 1920 and went back to work at schultz trucking . with the enactment of volstead act and the start of prohibition in the united states the shipping company began smuggling liquor and beer into new york city from canada . this led flegenheimer to start associating with known criminals . it was also during this time that flegenheimer became better known as `` dutch '' schultz -lrb- dutch is a corruption of `` deutsch '' -rrb- . other christmas eve santa claus rituals in the united states include reading a visit from st. nicholas or other tale about santa claus , watching a santa or christmas-related animated program on television -lrb- such as the aforementioned santa claus is comin ' to town and similar specials , such as rudolph the red-nosed reindeer , among many others -rrb- , and the singing of santa claus songs such as `` santa claus is coming to town '' , `` here comes santa claus '' , and `` up on the house top '' . last minute rituals for children before going to bed include aligning stockings at the mantelpiece or other place where santa can not fail to see them , peeking up the chimney -lrb- in homes with a fireplace -rrb- , glancing out a window and scanning the heavens for santa 's sleigh , and -lrb- in homes without a fireplace -rrb- unlocking an exterior door so santa can easily enter the house . after the children have fallen asleep , parents play the role of santa claus and leave their gifts under the christmas tree . tags on gifts for children are sometimes signed by their parents `` from santa claus '' before the gifts are laid beneath the tree . children can also receive a letter from santa through a variety of private agencies and organizations , and on occasion public and private cooperative ventures . an example of a public and private cooperative venture is the opportunity for expatriate and local children and parents to receive postmarked mail and greeting cards from santa during december in the finnish embassy in beijing , people 's republic of china , santa claus village in rovaniemi , finland , and the people 's republic of china postal system 's beijing international post office . parents can order a personalized `` santa letter '' to be sent to their child , often with a north pole postmark . the `` santa letter '' market generally relies on the internet as a medium for ordering such letters rather than retail stores .

's `` i have a dream '' speech wednesday on the same steps the civil rights leader spoke from half a century ago . `` his words belong to the ages , possessing a power and prophecy unmatched in our time , '' obama told a diverse crowd that gathered under gray skies and intermittent drizzle to attend the hours-long ceremony . king , obama said , `` gave mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions , '' hailing leaders who braved intimidation and violence in their fight for equal rights . yosemite national park -lrb- yoh-sem-i-tee -rrb- is an american national park located in the western sierra nevada of central california , bounded on the southeast by sierra national forest and on the northwest by stanislaus national forest . the park is managed by the national park service and covers an area of 748,436 acres -lrb- 1,169 sq mi ; 3,029 km2 -rrb- and sits in four counties : centered in tuolumne and mariposa , extending north and east to mono and south to madera county . designated a world heritage site in 1984 , yosemite is internationally recognized for its granite cliffs , waterfalls , clear streams , giant sequoia groves , lakes , mountains , meadows , glaciers , and biological diversity . almost 95 % of the park is designated wilderness.on average , about four million people visit yosemite each year , and most spend the majority of their time in the seven square miles -lrb- 18 km2 -rrb- of yosemite valley .

appearing in the neil simon play barefoot in the park led to two new contracts at paramount pictures and abc , both in 1968 . when paramount had decided to turn the television version of barefoot in the park into a predominantly african-american show , they planned for reed to star in something else . the new series was entitled the brady bunch and featured a widowed man with three children from a previous marriage , marrying a widow , also with three children from a previous marriage . the series ' creator , sherwood schwartz , said he was inspired to create the series after reading a news item in the los angeles times stating that `` more than 29 percent of all marriages included a child or children from a previous marriage '' . henderson spoke about reed being in the closet during a 2000 interview with abc news : `` here he was , the perfect father of this wonderful little family , a perfect husband . off camera , he was an unhappy person -- i think had bob not been forced to live this double life , i think it would have dissipated a lot of that anger and frustration . i never asked him . i never challenged him . reed described her show as '' a realistic picture of small town life with an often humorous twist . our plots revolve around the most important thing in america -- a loving family .

the advertised purpose of president barack obama 's pre-vacation news conference thursday was to highlight gains in the war against isis in iraq and syria with the pentagon as a backdrop . but for all his talk of terrorism , russia and other geopolitical challenges , the underlying argument he wanted to make was clear : it 's a serious business being commander-in-chief and the republican who wants his job is n't fit for the oval office . obama ridiculed donald trump 's recent suggestion that the election system could be rigged , called on the candidate to act like a president since he 's soon to be briefed on confidential information and implied that he did n't believe the billionaire businessman could be trusted with america 's nuclear codes . `` just listen to what mr. trump has to say and make your own judgment with respect to how confident you feel about his ability to manage things like our nuclear triad , '' he said in response to a question from cnn 's barbara starr . the police and media were at first convinced by the murder-suicide theory . dci thomas `` taff '' jones , deputy head of cid , was so sure sheila had killed her family that he ordered bamber 's cousins out of his office when they asked him to consider whether bamber had set the whole thing up . the daily express reported on 8 august 1985 , the day after the murders : on friday , july 13 , 1973 , during a preliminary interview , deputy minority counsel donald sanders asked white house assistant alexander butterfield if there was any type of recording system in the white house . butterfield said he was reluctant to answer , but finally admitted there was a new system in the white house that automatically recorded everything in the oval office , the cabinet room and others , as well as nixon 's private office in the old executive office building .
by the 1970s , a shift had occurred in international diplomatic circles and the prc had gained the upper hand in international diplomatic relations and recognition count . on 25 october 1971 , the 21st time the united nations general assembly debated on the prc 's admission into the un , united nations general assembly resolution 2758 was adopted , by which it recognized that `` the representatives of the government of the people 's republic of china are the only lawful representatives of china to the united nations and that the people 's republic of china is one of the five permanent members of the security council , '' and decided `` to restore all its rights to the people 's republic of china and to recognize the representatives of its government as the only legitimate representatives of china to the united nations , and to expel forthwith the representatives of chiang kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the united nations and in all the organizations related to it . '' this effectively transferred the seat of china in the un , including its permanent seat on the security council , from the roc to the prc , and expelled the roc from the un . from the united nations ' perspective the `` republic of china '' is not a former member . the un has always had problems with members refusing to pay the assessment levied upon them under the united nations charter , but the most significant refusal in recent times has been that of the united states . since 1985 , the u.s. congress has refused to authorize payment of the un dues , in order to force un compliance with u.s. wishes , as well as a reduction in the u.s. assessment . the blue that appears in the background of the insignia was chosen to be `` the opposite of red , the war colour '' , although the exact shade has never been officially specified by the united nations . the original colour the group chose in 1945 was a gray blue that differs from the current united nations flag . the globe used in the original design was an azimuthal projection focused on the north pole with the united states , the host nation of the conference , at the centre . the projection that was used cut off portions of the southern hemisphere at the latitude of argentina , which was acceptable at the time , as argentina was not planned to be an original member of the united nations .

in response to the court 's statement that , `` if the scientific uncertainty is so profound that it precludes epa from making a reasoned judgment as to whether greenhouse gases contribute to global warming , epa must say so , '' scalia responded that epa has done precisely that , in the form of the national research council panel that researched climate-change science . -lrb- but in fact , the panel stated that it `` generally agrees with the assessment of human-caused climate change presented in the ipcc working group i -lrb- wgi -rrb- scientific report , '' which concluded that most of the increase in global temperatures since the middle of the 20th century is `` very likely '' caused by man-made greenhouse gases . -rrb- it is worth noting that , in looking back in 2013 on the agency he helped shape from the beginning , administrator william ruckelshaus observed that a danger for epa was that air , water , waste and other programs would be unconnected , placed in `` silos , '' a problem that persists more than 50 years later , albeit less so than at the start . epa staff recall that in the early days there was `` an enormous sense of purpose and excitement '' and the expectation that `` there was this agency which was going to do something about a problem that clearly was on the minds of a lot of people in this country , '' leading to tens of thousands of resumes from those eager to participate in the mighty effort to clean up america 's environment .

in an interview the following month with democracy now ! , assange explained the story of the grounding of morales ' plane , saying that after the united states cancelled snowden 's passport , wikileaks thought about other strategies to take him to latin america , and they considered private presidential jets of those countries which offered support . the appointed jet was that of venezuelan president , nicolás maduro , but assange stated that `` the code language that we used deliberately swapped the presidential jet that we were considering for the bolivian jet ... and in some of our communications , we deliberately spoke about that on open lines to lawyers in the united states . and we did n't think much more of it . ... we did n't think this was anything more than just distracting .

in keeping with the idea that all enrolled students and `` former students '' comprise a family -lrb- the term alumni is not generally used , as `` former students '' include those who could not complete their education , such as those who entered military service -rrb- , aggies have created two traditions to honor members of the aggie family who have died . aggie muster is held annually on the anniversary of the battle of san jacinto , april 21 , to honor the death during the previous year of any enrolled student or alumni . over 300 musters are held around the world , with the largest taking place at reed arena on the texas a&m university campus . all muster ceremonies feature the roll call for the absent . the traditions of texas a&m university are a key aspect of the culture of texas a&m university . some of the school traditions date to the 1890s , shortly after the opening of the school , while others have been introduced more recently . these traditions encourage current students and alumni -lrb- aggies -rrb- to cultivate the aggie spirit , a sense of loyalty and respect for the school , and dictate many aspects of student life , including how to greet others , how to act at an a&m sporting event , and what words a student may use in conversation . the most visible tradition among senior class students and alumni -lrb- more commonly referred to as `` former students '' -rrb- is the wearing of the aggie ring , whose design has been relatively unchanged since its introduction in 1894 . every november , in the week of the football game against the university of texas , the senior class gathered together for elephant walk . the seniors link arms and `` wander aimlessly '' through campus . the university of texas game was always the last football game of the regular season , so elephant walk has come to symbolize the end of the seniors ' `` usefulness '' to the 12th man and the passing of the torch to the junior class . in a reference to elephant walk , seniors in their last semester of study are often called `` dead elephants .

franklin assembled a board of trustees from among the leading citizens of philadelphia , the first such non-sectarian board in america . at the first meeting of the 24 members of the board of trustees -lrb- november 13 , 1749 -rrb- , the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern . although a lot across sixth street from the old pennsylvania state house -lrb- later renamed and famously known since 1776 as `` independence hall '' -rrb- , was offered without cost by james logan , its owner , the trustees realized that the building erected in 1740 , which was still vacant , would be an even better site . the original sponsors of the dormant building still owed considerable construction debts and asked franklin 's group to assume their debts and , accordingly , their inactive trusts . despite the three charter dates of 1755 , 1779 and 1791 , the university used for more than a century the founding date of 1749 , the year in which founder benjamin franklin first convened a board of trustees to organize the new institution . in 1899 , the university 's board of trustees voted to change the founding date by nine years to 1740 , the year in which a group of philadelphia citizens established a trust for a charity school requested by traveling evangelist george whitefield . a frame of a building was erected , but the citizens discovered that they lacked the funds to furnish the interior chapel or open the charity school . in brief , in 1779 the college of philadelphia was directed by provost william smith . one might have expected it to evolve into the `` university of the state of pennsylvania '' but this did not occur . `` since the revolutionary state legislature felt that the board of trustees led by provost smith contained too many suspected loyalist sympathizers , they created a new board of trustees . '' thus , the university of the state of pennsylvania was created de novo .

'' the release date was moved once again in august 2014 from may 6 , 2016 , to march 25 , 2016 , with a warner bros. insider saying the studio was `` not flinching '' in regards to the previous opening date being on the same day as marvel studios ' captain america : civil war , but instead stating that march 2016 was a `` fantastic corridor '' for them . according to sources obtained by the hollywood reporter , warner bros. considered the possibility of having a 70 mm release for the film , which was partially shot in the 65 mm imax format . in august 2008 , warner bros. suggested a reboot of the film series . studio executive jeff robinov planned to have the film released either by 2010 or 2011 , explaining `` superman returns did n't quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to . it did n't position the character the way he needed to be positioned . had superman worked in 2006 , we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009 . in november 2013 , snyder clarified his film would not be based upon the aforementioned graphic novel . `` if you were going to do that , you would need a different superman . we 're bringing batman into the universe that now this superman lives in . '' batman v superman marks the first appearance of wonder woman in a live-action , theatrical film , which warner bros. had been developing as far back as 1996 .
the witnesses said the heat was strong enough to make the car 's metal body painful to the touch . cash said she had to use her coat to protect her hand from being burned when she finally got back in the car . when she touched the dashboard , landrum claimed her hand pressed into the softened vinyl , leaving an imprint that was evident weeks later . investigators cited it as proof of the witnesses ' account ; however , no photograph of it exists . in 1978 , landrum took over the commentary for the revamped world wide wrestling -lrb- formerly wide world wrestling -rrb- . johnny weaver , who provided the color commentary , later joined him . weaver was a well-known wrestler in the jcp stable . landrum dubbed him `` the dean of professional wrestling '' on the opening of their show one night , and that nickname stuck for the rest of weaver 's career . one day in april 1981 , a ch-47 helicopter flew into dayton . as colby watched , he became very upset . landrum decided to take him to the spot where the helicopter had landed with the hope that it would seem less frightening on the ground . when they reached the landing zone , they found a lot of people there already and had to wait some time before they were allowed to go inside the helicopter and talk to the pilot .
a lot of the efforts we took in the film were to explain why the suit looks the way it does . we did n't want it to be a random , ornamental decision . we start the film on the planet of krypton , which is where the suit comes from , and we go to great pains to show the suit fitting into the culture . all of the people you see on krypton are wearing this chainmail-like suit , with the same detailing as the superman suit . the opening theme 's the same and the concept 's no different , but `` arab idol '' is much more than just a popular singing competition . now in its second season , the middle eastern version of `` american idol '' is the feel-good story of the year . at a time when the arab world is so concerned about conflicts growing and sectarianism increasing , the show has done the near impossible : it 's given the troubled region something to smile about . `` you should vote for , only for music , '' a grinning and relaxed ahmad jamal says during rehearsal . superman has been interpreted and discussed in many forms in the years since his debut , with umberto eco noting that `` he can be seen as the representative of all his similars '' . writing in time in 1971 , gerald clarke stated : `` superman 's enormous popularity might be looked upon as signaling the beginning of the end for the horatio alger myth of the self-made man . '' clarke viewed the comics characters as having to continuously update in order to maintain relevance and thus representing the mood of the nation . he regarded superman 's character in the early seventies as a comment on the modern world , which he saw as a place in which `` only the man with superpowers can survive and prosper . ''
the senate 's chaplain began wednesday 's proceedings in the impeachment trial of president donald trump with a prayer urging senators to `` remember that patriots reside on both sides of the aisle , '' a pointed prayer that came hours after chief justice john roberts scolded democrats and republicans for their bellicose tone on the trial 's first full day . `` sovereign god , author of liberty , we gather in this historic chamber for the solemn responsibility of these impeachment proceedings . give wisdom to the distinguished chief justice john roberts as he presides . lord , you are all powerful and know our thoughts before we form them , '' chaplain barry black said in his prayer before the proceedings . when chief justice john roberts issued an extraordinary admonishment of democrats and republicans on the first day of president donald trump 's impeachment trial , he not only reminded speakers to maintain decorum but used a seldom-uttered word -- pettifogging -- to make his point . roberts had just listened to the impeachment managers and trump 's legal team sharply criticize each other early wednesday morning after house judiciary chairman jerry nadler , a new york democrat , made the case for issuing a subpoena for former national security adviser john bolton 's testimony . roberts said that kind of exchange was not appropriate and , providing a historical example , reminded the legal teams they they need to be on their best behavior . live updates : impeachment trial of president trump `` in the 1905 swayne trial , a senator objected when one of the managers used the word ` pettifogging ' and the presiding officer said the word ought not to have been used , '' roberts said . chief justice john roberts , who is presiding over the impeachment trial of president donald trump , scolded both the democratic house managers and the president 's defense team early wednesday morning after a contentious exchange on the senate floor . the extraordinary moment capped an acrimonious opening to trump 's impeachment trial , and placed roberts , who otherwise largely handled procedural tasks on day 1 , in the position of reminding advocates for both sides to maintain decorum during a highly partisan affair . `` i think it is appropriate for me to admonish both the house managers and the president 's counsel in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world 's greatest deliberative body , '' roberts said . `` one reason it has earned that title is because its members avoid speaking in a manner and using language that is not conducive to civil discourse . ''

in his 1678 traité de la lumière , christiaan huygens showed how snell 's law of sines could be explained by , or derived from , the wave nature of light , using what we have come to call the huygens -- fresnel principle . snell was involved in the filming of planes that landed at mena intermountain municipal airport in mena , arkansas , thought of by snell and many conspiracy theorists to be used in a government-sanctioned operation of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- to smuggle drugs into the united states . snell had claimed that law enforcement agencies , both state and those local to that area of western arkansas , were involved in the cover-up of the mena airport drug smuggling . he had also made claims that he had filmed the then-governor of arkansas , bill clinton , at mena intermountain municipal airport , but that claim has never been proven . snell further claimed that one of the arkansas state troopers who was assigned to the governor 's security team at that time had beaten snell 's wife in an attempt to force her to reveal the location of the alleged video footage snell had taken at the airport . snell , known to his friends as `` wayne '' , was an anomaly amongst the militants of the csa , in that he operated autonomously , using the csa compound as his base of operation . steven scott , a frequent collaborator with snell , gave this information in a federal prison holding cell to one of the then members .
at the same time , on may 18 , 1781 , incan clothing and cultural traditions , and self-identification as `` inca '' were outlawed , along with other measures to convert the population to spanish culture and government until peru 's independence as a republic . however , even after the death of amaru , native revolts still seized much of what is today southern peru , bolivia and argentina , as native revolutionaries captured spanish towns and beheaded many inhabitants . in one instance , a native-american army under rebel leader túpac katari besieged the city of la paz for 109 days before troops sent from buenos aires stepped in to relieve the city . during a stage of his rebellion , túpac amaru ii was able to convince the quechua speakers to join him . therefore , under his command , the quechua speakers fought alongside him with aymara-speaking rebels from puno on lake titicaca and on the bolivian side of the lake . unfortunately , the alliance did not last that long and this led the aymara leader , túpac katari , to lead his army alone which ultimately led to his capture in october 1781 . his partner and female commander , bartola sisa , took control after his capture and lead an astonishing amount of 2,000 soldiers for several months . `` women , as much as men , were affected by these injustices . '' in fact , tupac amaru ii 's wife , michaela bastidas , commanded a battalion of insurgents and was responsible for the uprising in the san felipe de tungasuca region . she is also often credited to being more daring and a superior strategist , compared to túpac amaru ii . it is told that she scolded her husband for his weakness and refusal to set up a surprise attack against the spaniards in cuzco to catch the inferior city off guard . instead of listening to his wife , túpac amaru ii lost precious time by encircling the country in hopes that he could gather more recruits for his army .

school is over and summer has begun in the dead-end seaside town of rainmouth . while jamie 's friends seem to be happy working in the local pie factory by day and looking for sex by night , jamie is bored out of his mind , running his pot-head mother 's b&b . he 's desperate to get out of there . but when he meets beautiful , smart and sexy american traveler juliana at a party , he 's smitten - the world is not so small after all . druckmann felt that players , specifically parents , would be able to relate to joel 's character and his bonding with ellie . baker believes that joel discovers morality throughout the game 's narrative , working out the difference between loss and sacrifice , and his true personality begins to show . druckmann became intrigued by players who discussed joel 's morality , distinguishing him as a hero or villain ; druckmann felt that joel was only `` a complex person who 's made good and bad decisions '' , but allowed it to be open to interpretation . when auditioning for the role , baker read a phrase on the character sheet that stated joel had `` few moral lines left to cross '' , which became the `` anchor point '' to the character for him . joel -lrb- troy baker -rrb- is the protagonist of the last of us . originally from texas , joel was a single father in his late 20s when the initial cordyceps outbreak occurred . fleeing with his brother tommy and his twelve-year-old daughter sarah , they got involved in a firefight with a soldier , and sarah was mortally wounded and died in his arms , leaving him traumatized . in the 20 years that follow , joel did whatever he had to do to survive .
however , in an indicator that the fda may be too lax in their approval process , in particular for medical devices , a 2011 study by dr. diana zuckerman and paul brown of the national research center for women and families , and dr. steven nissen of the cleveland clinic , published in the archives of internal medicine , showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for `` serious health problems or death '' had been previously approved by the fda using the less stringent , and cheaper , 510 -lrb- k -rrb- process . in a few cases the devices had been deemed so low-risk that they did not need fda regulation . of the 113 devices recalled , 35 were for cardiovascular health purposes . outside of the us , the drug thalidomide was marketed for the relief of general nausea and morning sickness but caused birth defects and even the death of thousands of babies when taken during pregnancy . american mothers were largely unaffected as dr. frances oldham kelsey of the fda refused to authorize the medication for market , the 1962 kefauver-harris amendment to the fd&c act was passed , which represented a `` revolution '' in fda regulatory authority . the most important change was the requirement that all new drug applications demonstrate `` substantial evidence '' of the drug 's efficacy for a marketed indication , in addition to the existing requirement for pre-marketing demonstration of safety . this marked the start of the fda approval process in its modern form . the fda has regulatory oversight over a large array of products that affect the health and life of american citizens . as a result , the fda 's powers and decisions are carefully monitored by several governmental and non-governmental organizations . a $ 1.8 million 2006 institute of medicine report on pharmaceutical regulation in the u.s. found major deficiencies in the current fda system for ensuring the safety of drugs on the american market . overall , the authors called for an increase in the regulatory powers , funding , and independence of the fda .

will tracy , an associate editor at the onion , told the new york times in 2010 that the office of the vice president had sent the onion staff an email with the message `` keep it up . he really likes it . '' tracy commented , `` apparently he 's a fan .

americans ' confidence in the economy is sinking . it 's at its lowest level so far in 2016 , according to the weekly survey known as the gallup u.s. economic confidence index . in fact , people 's perceptions of the economy have n't been this poor since late august when stock markets around the world were crashing and there were fears china might be slipping into a deep downturn . it was clear why people were anxious in august . primary turnout is way up this year compared with 2012 . according to a recent pew study , it 's on pace to rival 2008 's record of 30.4 percent . still , less than a third of americans will take part in the process . that does n't mean they do n't want to show off their participation . when americans experience health problems , they do n't just rely on doctors and medications . a new study found that most americans have turned to prayer to heal themselves and others . the study found that about nine out of 10 americans have relied on healing prayer at some point in their lives , with most of them praying for other people 's health and well-being more than their own . `` it was very surprising , '' said the study 's author , jeff levin , professor of epidemiology and population health at baylor university .
although not discovered until several years after nixon had resigned and colson had finished serving his prison term , the transcript of a white house conversation between nixon and colson tape-recorded on june 20 , 1972 , has denials from both men of the white house 's involvement in the break-in . hunt had been off the payroll for three months . colson asks `` do they think i 'm that dumb ?

'' hunt put pressure on the white house and the committee to re-elect the president for cash payments to cover legal fees , family support , and expenses , for himself and his fellow burglars . key nixon figures , including haldeman , charles colson , herbert w. kalmbach , john mitchell , fred larue , and john dean eventually became entangled in the payoff schemes , and large amounts of money were passed to hunt and his accomplices , to try to ensure their silence at the trial , by pleading guilty to avoid prosecutors ' questions , and afterwards . tenacious media , including the washington post and the new york times , eventually used investigative journalism to break open the payoff scheme , and published many articles that proved to be the beginning of the end for the cover-up . prosecutors had to follow up once the media reported .

thanks to its large reserves of oil , the small gulf state of kuwait has transformed over the decades from a humble pearl-farming backwater into one of the world 's richest countries per capita . but too much of a good thing , as many of kuwait 's 2.6 million inhabitants are discovering , can be problematic . in recent years , kuwaiti waistlines have swollen to make them among the most obese people on the planet . nearly 70 % of kuwaiti males over 15 are overweight or obese , according to the world health organization . marine biology is the scientific study of marine life , organisms in the sea . given that in biology many phyla , families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land , marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy . a large proportion of all life on earth lives in the ocean . the exact size of this large proportion is unknown , since many ocean species are still to be discovered . the room was lined with baby after baby , and it was almost too warm for keri dykes to tolerate . she remembers squeezing between the incubators to see her son jesse , who had been born only 25 weeks into her pregnancy . a neonatal intensive care unit in tupelo , mississippi , is where jesse spent his brief life in 2008 -- a life cut short by an infection that got into his bloodstream and lungs . the first time dykes , 29 , got to hold him and look at him face to face , she remembers that his pretty blue eyes were open as he was dying .

'' this two-fold epoch dating serves to place the constitution in the context of the religious traditions of western civilization and , at the same time , links it to the regime principles proclaimed in the declaration of independence . this dual reference can also be found in the articles of confederation and the northwest ordinance . congress sets a national election day . currently , electors are chosen on the tuesday following the first monday in november -lrb- the first tuesday after november 1 -rrb- , in the year before the president 's term is to expire . the electors cast their votes on the monday following the second wednesday in december -lrb- the first monday after december 12 -rrb- of that year . thereafter , the votes are opened and counted by the vice president , as president of the senate , in a joint session of congress .
in 1950s pittsburgh , troy maxson lives with his wife rose and their son cory , and works as a garbage collector alongside his best friend , jim bono . troy 's younger brother , gabriel , sustained a head injury in world war ii that left him mentally impaired , for which he received a $ 3,000 government payout that troy subsequently uses as a down payment on a home for his family . gabriel has since moved out to live across the street at `` miss pearl 's '' house , so troy no longer gets rent money from gabe , which places the family under financial strain . gabe sometimes gets in trouble with the law for his erratic behavior . since charles henderson was thinking of the effects of polio and did not know that this disease would be eradicated by the salk vaccine after his death , the courts were needed to clarify his will and trust as a cripple children 's hospital was no longer needed . in point of fact , there is not one in alabama today . the net result is that the charles henderson child health care center in troy was built in lieu of a hospital . there is currently $ 41 million in the trust to operate the clinic , and the trust continues to grow every year . troy later released one of his more commercial albums , by any means necessary , in 2004 . this album included the hit `` ridin ' big '' . following this release , pastor troy was released from his universal contract because of creativity disputes . he then released face off , part ii , which addressed some issues with lil scrappy and bme , adding new songs , and even remade some of his hits .
tech tycoon jack ma really hates the trade war between the united states and china . `` trade war is the most stupid thing in this world , '' ma said monday at a conference in shanghai hosted by the chinese government . it 's the latest and perhaps bluntest barb about the trade conflict from the co-founder and executive chairman of alibaba -lrb- baba -rrb- , china 's biggest internet company . in september , he blamed it for derailing his highly ambitious promise to create 1 million new us jobs . the vietnam war -lrb- vietnamese : chiến tranh việt nam -rrb- , also known as the second indochina war , and in vietnam as the resistance war against america -lrb- vietnamese : kháng chiến chống mỹ -rrb- or simply the american war , was a conflict in vietnam , laos , and cambodia from 1 november 1955 to the fall of saigon on 30 april 1975 . it was the second of the indochina wars and was officially fought between north vietnam and south vietnam . north vietnam was supported by the soviet union , china , and other communist allies ; south vietnam was supported by the united states , south korea , the philippines , australia , thailand and other anti-communist allies . the war , considered a cold war-era proxy war by some , lasted 19 years , with direct u.s. involvement ending in 1973 , and included the laotian civil war and the cambodian civil war , which ended with all three countries becoming communist in 1975 . the united states of america -lrb- usa -rrb- , commonly known as the united states -lrb- u.s. or us -rrb- or america , is a country comprising 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . at 3.8 million square miles -lrb- 9.8 million km2 -rrb- , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of europe . most of the country is located in central north america between canada and mexico . with an estimated population of over 328 million , the u.s. is the third most populous country .
this is really one which i think was breathtaking in its surprise ... there has been , over the last few years , some specific planning for the possibility of a significant hurricane in new orleans with a lot of rainfall , with water rising in the levees and water overflowing the levee ... and although the planning was not complete , a lot of work had been done . but there were two problems here . first of all , it 's as if someone took that plan and dropped an atomic bomb simply to make it more difficult . the new orleans medical and surgical journal was a bimonthly medical journal published between 1844 and 1952 , and the predecessor of the contemporary journal of the louisiana state medical society . it published samuel cartwright 's pseudoscientific theories of race and disease , including the first treatment of the conjectural disease drapetomania . the journal was involved in debates on neuroscience and circulation in the 19th century . in 1854 , physiologist bennet dowler assumed a position as editor of the journal after having been chairman of the committee on medical science of the american medical association . dowler reserved substantial portions of the journal for his own work , leading to an unpopular reputation among the journal 's community . during this period , dowler 's work concerned post-mortem and statistical studies of human corpses . dowler , who found new orleans ' population receptive of his experimentation , utilized cholera and yellow fever epidemics to supply the necessary cadavers .
on the streets , in small gatherings and in the halls of government , people around the globe weighed in on us president donald trump 's inauguration friday , anticipating how his policies may play out on the international stage . but it was russia 's officials who tweeted some of the most celebratory messages , with one senator calling the day `` a defining moment in history . '' here is some of the reaction from around the world , from opposition to support -- and even indifference : belgium a women 's march in brussels elicited criticism of trump 's offensive comments about women and alleged cases of sexual harassment . the demonstration drew participants from a range of countries , including norway and spain . he campaigned on the huge crowd sizes , but the turnout for the inauguration of president donald trump appears to be smaller than that of his predecessor as measured by side-by-side photos of the two events . it 's hard to gauge crowd sizes and the national park service , which oversees the national mall , does n't offer estimates of any sort . but the side-by-side images of friday 's ceremony alongside the 2009 inauguration of president barack obama show a significantly smaller crowd on the national mall for trump than for obama . there is empty ground exposed in the trump photos . donald trump placed the wreath at arlington national cemetery in one of the kick-off ceremonial events in advance of his inauguration at the capitol on friday . flanked by mike pence and standing before his children and families , trump laid the wreath at the tomb of the unknowns in arlington , virginia . tom barrack , the chair of trump 's inaugural committee and a close friend , said trump was `` transitioning from candidate to president . '' `` if you look at his eyes at arlington , you see in that moment , in that anticipation of that peaceful transfer of partisan power , that the rhetoric of the campaign moves aside , '' he told cnn 's dana bash and jake tapper .
the first recorded european landing on the washington coast was by spanish captain don bruno de heceta in 1775 , on board the santiago , part of a two-ship flotilla with the sonora . he claimed the coastal lands up to prince william sound for spain as part of their claimed rights under the treaty of tordesillas , which they maintained made the pacific a `` spanish lake '' and all its shores part of the spanish empire . in january 2008 , american officials accused iran of harassing and provoking their naval vessels in the strait of hormuz , but iran denied the claim . the united states presented audio and video footage of the incident , which included threats made to the americans . iranians have told the washington post that the accent in the recording does not sound iranian . iran has accused the united states of creating a `` media fuss '' and has released its own abridged video recording of the incident , which does not contain threats . on 13 august 2018 , iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei banned direct talks with u.s. , referring to the failure of the previous ones . `` there will be no war , nor will we negotiate with the us '' and `` even if we ever -- impossible as it is -- negotiated with the us , it would never ever be with the current us administration , '' khamenei said . he added that the united states never budges on the primary goal they pursue in negotiations , which are normally based on give and take , and `` reneges on its own end of the bargain '' after the negotiation . in november 2018 , all the sanctions removed in 2015 were re-imposed on iran by the trump administration .
dunkin' donuts has a close relationship with the boston red sox and the new england patriots , making commercials at the start of each team 's season for promotions . dunkin' donuts also sponsors other professional sports teams , including the dallas cowboys , new york yankees , new york mets , philadelphia eagles , and tampa bay rays . in january 2014 , english football club liverpool announced a multimillion-pound global partnership with the company . dunkin' donuts signed a sponsorship deal with the national women 's hockey league in december 2015 . in january 2018 , dunkin' donuts began to open new concept locations , beginning in quincy , featuring modern decor , cold beverages on tap and a single-cup brewing machine , more packaged take-out options , and dedicated pick-up lines for mobile ordering inside and in the drive-thru . the concept was described as being part of a shift towards becoming an `` on-the-go , beverage-led brand '' . in addition , the location , as well as others , began to trial signage referring to the chain as simply `` dunkin' '' -- downplaying `` donuts '' from the name . dunkin' donuts , often abbreviated as dd and officially known as simply dunkin' , is an american multinational coffeehouse and donut company . it was founded by william rosenberg in quincy , massachusetts in 1950 . the chain was acquired by baskin-robbins ' holding company allied domecq in 1990 ; its acquisition of the mister donut chain and the conversion of that chain to dunkin' donuts facilitated the brand 's growth in north america that year . dunkin' donuts and baskin-robbins have been subsidiaries of dunkin' brands , headquartered in canton , massachusetts , since 2004 .
based on his philanthropic worldview , clinton created the william j. clinton foundation to address issues of global importance . this foundation includes the clinton foundation hiv and aids initiative -lrb- chai -rrb- , which strives to combat that disease , and has worked with the australian government toward that end . the clinton global initiative -lrb- cgi -rrb- , begun by the clinton foundation in 2005 , attempts to address world problems such as global public health , poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict . in 2005 , clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools . clinton greatly expanded the state department 's use of social media , including facebook and twitter , to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-à-vis their governments . and in the mideast turmoil , clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure , the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide . moreover , in a formulation that became known as the `` hillary doctrine '' , she viewed women 's rights as critical for u.s. security interests , due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state , and the instability and challenge to international security of that state . in turn , there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities , and in some cases feeling safer , as the result of her actions and visibility . on october 21 , 1994 , the clinton administration launched the first official white house website , whitehouse.gov . the site was followed with three more versions , resulting in the final edition launched in 2000 . the white house website was part of a wider movement of the clinton administration toward web-based communication . according to robert longley , `` clinton and gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies , the u.s. court system and the u.s. military onto the internet , thus opening up america 's government to more of america 's citizens than ever before .
the trump administration is increasingly making it harder for the affordable care act to operate raising questions about whether the republican party -- which failed to overhaul the law in the senate -- will finally fix the health care law or leave it to flounder . on thursday morning , president donald trump announced an executive order that would make it easier for small businesses to pool together in group insurance plans , an idea that experts have warned could lure healthier enrollees away from the obamacare market place and into skimpier plans . by thursday night , trump had announced another blow to obamacare : he would no longer make what are known as cost-sharing reduction payments , funding the federal government gives to insurers to reduce health care costs of low-income people . for months , trump has been threatening to cease the payments , but even congressional republicans have privately acknowledged that stopping them could throw the health care system into chaos . on thursday , president donald trump signed an executive order aimed at allowing people to band together to seek more affordable health insurance , a move some consider an attempt to cripple the affordable care act . it was the 49th executive order that trump has signed since coming into office on january 20 . the last president to sign that many executive orders through october 13 of his first year in office ? lyndon johnson . president donald trump plans to end a key set of obamacare subsidies that helped lower-income enrollees pay for health care , the white house said thursday , a dramatic move that raises questions about the law 's future . the late-night announcement is part of trump 's aggressive push to dismantle aspects of his predecessor 's signature health law after several failed attempts by congress to repeal it earlier this year . in a series of tweets friday morning , trump called on democrats to reach out to him to `` fix '' the law , which he called a `` broken mess . '' `` the democrats obamacare is imploding .
the white house said president barack obama supports reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons -- a position he took in the 2008 campaign but failed to press during his first term . `` it does remain a commitment of his , '' presidential spokesman jay carney told reporters as the nation reeled from a mass shooting in connecticut that mainly killed school children . an emotional obama did not address that issue directly in a televised statement from the white house on the shootings at sandy hook elementary school in newtown that killed 26 people , but he said something had to be done . `` we 're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this , regardless of the politics , '' said obama , the father of two girls . wiping away tears and choking up , president barack obama mourned the `` beautiful little kids '' slain friday in a shooting massacre at a connecticut school and called for preventing similar tragedies `` regardless of the politics . '' it was a rare emotional display by obama , known more for stoicism in such situations , and he referred to other recent u.s. mass shootings in calling for a national response . `` as a country , we have been through this too many times , '' obama said in a brief statement to reporters at the white house about the attack at the sandy hook elementary school in newtown that killed at least 26 people , including 20 schoolchildren . `` whether it 's an elementary school in newtown or a shopping mall in oregon or a temple in wisconsin or a movie theater in aurora -lrb- colorado -rrb- or a street corner in chicago , these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods and these children are our children , '' said obama , who has been criticized for being soft on gun control issues by some on the political left . authorities in newtown , connecticut , put together more pieces of the puzzle saturday to explain what happened inside sandy hook elementary school , one day after a gunman opened fire there , killing 20 students and six adults . all the victims died from gunshot wounds and were struck more than once , according to h. wayne carver ii , chief medical examiner for the state of connecticut . their deaths were classified as homicides . `` i 've been at this for a third of a century .
wednesday is national day , a day for all chinese to celebrate the people 's republic of china . yes , dignitaries gathered and ceremonies took place to mark the holiday in hong kong . but the national pride mixed with profound dissent as pro-democracy protesters occupied parts of the asian business hub -- not to celebrate the central government in beijing , but to denounce and challenge it . live blog : follow cnn 's coverage of the protests there was a sense , entering wednesday , that the protest ranks could swell with more people off work for the holiday . the hong kong government said monday that riot police have pulled back from pro-democracy demonstrations around the city that have caused widespread disruption in one of asia 's financial hubs . defiant demonstrators remained on the streets of hong kong 's financial center , blocking traffic on key highways a day after clashes with police that left more than 40 people injured . explaining the decision to withdraw the riot police , the government said in a statement that the protesters on the streets were now behaving peacefully . but protesters have pointed out that the unrest sunday resulted from heavy-handed police tactics . pro-democracy activists took their fight thursday to the doorstep of hong kong 's chief executive , sitting down outside his office gates to express their dissatisfaction with him and the central government in beijing . some demonstrators say the next step could be occupying the inside of government buildings . it would be a drastic move , but one protest leader says it might be necessary to get officials ' attention and bring change . `` we still ca n't get a normal , acceptable response , '' student leader joshua wong , 17 , told cnn 's andrew stevens .
the autopsy of president john f. kennedy was performed , beginning at about 8 p.m. est november 22 , 1963 , on the day of his assassination and ending at about 12:30 am est november 23 , 1963 , at the bethesda naval hospital in bethesda , maryland . the choice of autopsy hospital in the washington , d.c. area was made by his widow , jacqueline kennedy . she chose the bethesda naval hospital because president kennedy had been a naval officer . the yellow ribbon fund -lrb- yrf -rrb- is a charity that primarily helps returning american service men & women , injured during active service , who are recovering at walter reed army medical center and bethesda naval hospital . the charity was founded on march 1 , 2005 and is based in bethesda , md. . roy herman kellerman -lrb- march 14 , 1915 -- march 22 , 1984 -rrb- was a u.s. secret service agent who was assigned to protect u.s. president john f. kennedy when the latter was assassinated on november 22 , 1963 . in his reports , later testimony and interviews , kellerman outlines in detail his role in the immediate aftermath of the assassination , controlling key evidence of the crime and guiding doctors during the official autopsy at bethesda naval hospital .
the senator responsible for steering legislation through the senate is the representative of the government in the senate , who is a senator selected by the prime minister and whose role is to introduce legislation on behalf of the government . the position was created in 2016 to replace the former position of leader of the government in the senate . the opposition equivalent is the leader of the opposition in the senate , who is selected by his or her counterpart in the house of commons , the leader of the opposition . however , if the official opposition in the commons is a different party than the official opposition in the senate -lrb- as was the case from 2011 to 2015 -rrb- , then the senate party chooses its own leader . the senate also retained the power to try treason cases , and to elect some magistrates , but only with the permission of the emperor . in the final years of the western empire , the senate would sometimes try to appoint their own emperor , such as in the case of eugenius , who was later defeated by forces loyal to theodosius i . the senate remained the last stronghold of the traditional roman religion in the face of the spreading christianity , and several times attempted to facilitate the return of the altar of victory -lrb- first removed by constantius ii -rrb- to the senatorial curia . the senate tends to be less partisan and confrontational than the commons and is more likely to come to a consensus on issues . it also often has more opportunity to study proposed bills in detail either as a whole or in committees . this careful review process is why the senate is still today called the chamber of `` sober second thought '' , though the term has a slightly different meaning than it did when used by john a. macdonald . the format of the senate allows it to make many small improvements to legislation before its final reading .
in 1979 , hanks moved to new york city , where he made his film debut in the low-budget slasher film he knows you 're alone -lrb- 1980 -rrb- and landed a starring role in the television movie mazes and monsters . early that year , he was cast in the lead , callimaco , in the riverside shakespeare company 's production of niccolò machiavelli 's the mandrake , directed by daniel southern . the following year , hanks landed one of the lead roles , that of character kip wilson , on the abc television pilot of bosom buddies . he and peter scolari played a pair of young advertising men forced to dress as women so they could live in an inexpensive all-female hotel . gangs of new york is a 2002 american epic period drama film directed by martin scorsese , set in the new york slums , and inspired by herbert asbury 's non-fiction book , the gangs of new york . the screenplay was written by jay cocks , steven zaillian , and kenneth lonergan . the film stars leonardo dicaprio , daniel day-lewis and cameron diaz . after this , kimmel 's sidekick , guillermo , appeared in a spoof of the bourne ultimatum , which starred damon . he was then chased down by damon , who was cursing about kimmel being behind all this . guillermo also stopped damon on the red carpet one time and before he could finish the interview he said , `` sorry , we are out of time . '' the most recent encounter was titled `` the handsome men 's club '' which featured kimmel , along with the `` handsome men '' , who were : matthew mcconaughey , rob lowe , lenny kravitz , patrick dempsey , sting , keith urban , john krasinski , ethan hawke , josh hartnett , tony romo , ted danson , taye diggs , gilles marini , and ben affleck , speaking about being handsome and all the jobs that come with it .
thanks to his close relationship with the nixon administration , thurmond was able to deliver a great deal of federal money , appointments and projects to his state . with a like-minded president in the white house , thurmond became a very effective power broker in washington . his staffers said his goal was to be south carolina 's `` indispensable man '' in washington , d.c. james strom thurmond sr. -lrb- december 5 , 1902 -- june 26 , 2003 -rrb- was an american politician who served for 48 years as a united states senator from south carolina . he ran for president in 1948 as the states ' rights democratic party candidate , receiving 2.4 % of the popular vote and 39 electoral votes . thurmond represented south carolina in the united states senate from 1954 until 2003 , at first as a southern democrat and , after 1964 , as a republican . a magnet for controversy during his nearly half-century senate career , thurmond switched parties because of his opposition to the civil rights act of 1964 and his support for republican presidential candidate senator barry goldwater . a magnet for controversy during his nearly half-century senate career , thurmond switched parties because of his opposition to the civil rights act of 1964 and his support for republican presidential candidate senator barry goldwater . in the months before switching , he had `` been critical of the democratic administration for ... enactment of the civil rights law '' , while goldwater `` boasted of his opposition to the civil rights act , and made it part of his platform . '' thurmond left office as the only member of either chamber of congress to reach the age of 100 while still in office , and as the oldest-serving and longest-serving senator in u.s. history -lrb- although he was later surpassed in the latter by robert byrd and daniel inouye -rrb- . thurmond holds the record as the longest-serving member of congress to serve exclusively in the senate .
fox news might be backing down from its campaign against `` no-go zones , '' but bobby jindal is n't . and now the louisiana governor 's political action committee is taking up the cause . stand up to washington pac , which was launched by jindal last year with a mission to send more conservatives to capitol hill , urged supporters on wednesday to stand up to the `` liberal media '' and sign a petition in solidarity with the potential 2016 contender . `` tell the liberal media to stop their shameless attacks against governor jindal for telling the truth about radical islam , '' reads the page on the pac 's website . louisiana gov. bobby jindal on monday stood by his criticism of so-called `` no-go '' zones in europe , where sovereign nations allegedly cede authority to muslim immigrants , a controversial idea that many critics say is overblown . and the potential 2016 republican presidential candidate decried what he called immigrants ' insistence on `` non-assimilation , the fact that `` you 've got people who want to come to our country but not adopt our values , '' which he called `` dangerous . '' jindal has the reputation of policy wonk among republicans and boldly told gop officials during a 2013 address to the republican national committee that they `` must stop being the stupid party '' and needed to `` stop insulting the intelligence of voters . '' readers of presidential tea leaves often look for several signs that someone is planning to run for the white house : trips to iowa and new hampshire , the release of non-controversial memoirs , and in recent years , the creation of various patriotically named political committees on his or her behalf . at this early stage of the 2016 presidential race , no major candidates have actually declared their candidacies or set up their official presidential campaigns , but several possible contenders have established , or had established on their behalf , a variety of political organizations that might best be described as their `` pre-campaign committees . '' republican gov. scott walker of wisconsin launched a 527 called `` our american revival '' on tuesday .
a `` hold '' is placed when the leader 's office is notified that a senator intends to object to a request for unanimous consent from the senate to consider or pass a measure . a hold may be placed for any reason and can be lifted by a senator at any time . a senator may place a hold simply to review a bill , to negotiate changes to the bill , or to kill the bill . a bill can be held for as long as the senator who objects to the bill wishes to block its consideration . on occasion , the senate may go into what is called a secret or closed session . during a closed session , the chamber doors are closed , cameras are turned off , and the galleries are completely cleared of anyone not sworn to secrecy , not instructed in the rules of the closed session , or not essential to the session . closed sessions are rare and usually held only when the senate is discussing sensitive subject matter such as information critical to national security , private communications from the president , or deliberations during impeachment trials . a senator may call for and force a closed session if the motion is seconded by at least one other member , but an agreement usually occurs beforehand . the rules of the senate provide that no senator may make more than two speeches on a motion or bill on the same legislative day . a legislative day begins when the senate convenes and ends with adjournment ; hence , it does not necessarily coincide with the calendar day . the length of these speeches is not limited by the rules ; thus , in most cases , senators may speak for as long as they please . often , the senate adopts unanimous consent agreements imposing time limits .
the papal basilica of st. peter in the vatican -lrb- italian : basilica papale di san pietro in vaticano -rrb- , or simply st. peter 's basilica -lrb- latin : basilica sancti petri -rrb- , is a church built in the renaissance style located in vatican city , the papal enclave which is within the city of rome . designed principally by donato bramante , michelangelo , carlo maderno and gian lorenzo bernini , st. peter 's is the most renowned work of renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world . while it is neither the mother church of the catholic church nor the cathedral of the diocese of rome , st. peter 's is regarded as one of the holiest catholic shrines . it has been described as `` holding a unique position in the christian world '' and as `` the greatest of all churches of christendom '' . catholic tradition holds that the basilica is the burial site of saint peter , chief among jesus 's apostles and also the first bishop of rome -lrb- pope -rrb- . old st. peter 's basilica was the 4th-century church begun by the emperor constantine the great between 319 and 333 ad . it was of typical basilical form , a wide nave and two aisles on each side and an apsidal end , with the addition of a transept or bema , giving the building the shape of a tau cross . it was over 103.6 metres -lrb- 340 ft -rrb- long , and the entrance was preceded by a large colonnaded atrium . this church had been built over the small shrine believed to mark the burial place of st. peter , though the tomb was `` smashed '' in 846 ad . it is the most prominent building in the vatican city . its dome is a dominant feature of the skyline of rome . probably the largest church in christendom , it covers an area of 2.3 hectares -lrb- 5.7 acres -rrb- . one of the holiest sites of christianity and catholic tradition , it is traditionally the burial site of its titular , st. peter , who was the head of the twelve apostles of jesus and , according to tradition , the first bishop of antioch and later the first bishop of rome , rendering him the first pope .
the pair joined the tonight show starring johnny carson on october 1 , 1962 , on nbc . he describes what happened when the pair first met , the whole meeting being `` about as exciting as watching a traffic light change '' . for almost 30 years , mcmahon introduced the show with a drawn-out `` heeere 's johnny ! '' his booming voice and constant laughter alongside the `` king of late night '' earned mcmahon the nickname the `` human laugh track '' and `` toymaker to the king '' . in 1967 , mcmahon had a role in the film the incident and appeared as santa claus on the mitzi gaynor christmas show . from 1965 to 1969 , mcmahon served as `` communicator '' -lrb- host -rrb- of the saturday afternoon segment of monitor , the weekend news , features and entertainment magazine on the nbc radio network . the 1955 movie dementia , which has music without dialogue , was released as daughter of horror in 1970 . the newer version , which had a voice over by mcmahon , still has music without dialogue , but with an added narration read by him . aside from his co-hosting duties , it also fell upon mcmahon during the early years of carson 's tenure -lrb- when the show ran 105 minutes -rrb- to host the first fifteen minutes of tonight , which did not air nationally . mcmahon also served as guest host on at least one occasion , substituting for carson during a week of programs that aired between july 29 and august 2 , 1963 , and again for two nights in october 1963 . mcmahon served as a counter to the notoriously shy carson . nonetheless , mcmahon once told an interviewer that after his many decades as an emcee , he would still get `` butterflies '' in his stomach every time he would walk onto a stage and would use that nervousness as a source of energy .
a decisive election win for japanese prime minister shinzo abe boosts one of us president donald trump 's strongest allies in asia as both washington and tokyo grapple with how to handle pyongyang . abe , a conservative hawk , has long been a supporter of trump 's more aggressive north korea policy , which has coincided with his attempts to rewrite japan 's post-war pacifist constitution . following sunday 's vote , japanese defense minister itsunori onodera warned the threat from north korea -- which has repeatedly fired missiles over japan in recent months -- had reached an `` unprecedented , critical and imminent '' level . the us , south korea and japan need to collectively trial `` different responses '' for tackling the regime , onodera told a meeting of the countries ' military officials monday . secretary of defense james mattis said saturday that the increasing nuclear threat from north korea has brought `` a new urgency '' to military and diplomatic collaboration with south korea . `` the threat from north korea has grown markedly even since my trip here earlier this year , '' mattis said while appearing alongside his south korean counterpart , song young-moo , at a press conference in seoul . `` north korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbors and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs , '' he added , emphasizing that the us `` does not accept a nuclear north korea . '' the pentagon chief made his remarks one day after visiting the demilitarized zone that separates north and south korea and meeting with south korean president moon jae-in at the country 's presidential palace . senate intelligence committee investigators have spoken with several russians who attended a june 2016 trump tower meeting with donald trump jr. , a sign that the matter remains a significant focus for lawmakers looking into potential coordination between trump associates and kremlin-linked operatives during the presidential campaign . sen. richard burr , the chairman of the senate intelligence committee , told cnn that the panel has interviewed some of the russians who were at that meeting , which trump jr. attended after being promised dirt on the clinton campaign and being informed that the russian government wanted his father to win the presidency . paul manafort , who was then the trump campaign chairman , along with the president 's son-in-law , jared kushner , also attended the meeting . the intelligence committee has previously met with both kushner and manafort , but has not yet brought in trump jr. . burr said the committee is `` sequencing '' its interviews to speak with everyone else `` involved in the meeting before we know exactly what we want from don jr. '' burr , r-north carolina , would not say which russians , or how many , investigators have spoken with .
the national transportation safety board -lrb- ntsb -rrb- investigation , after reconstructions of the accident in flight simulators , deemed that training for such an event involved too many factors to be practical . while some level of control was possible , no precision could be achieved , and a landing under these conditions was stated to be `` a highly random event '' . expert pilots were unable to reproduce a survivable landing ; according to a united pilot who flew with fitch , `` most of the simulations never even made it close to the ground '' . the ntsb stated that `` under the circumstances the ual -lrb- united airlines -rrb- flight crew performance was highly commendable and greatly exceeded reasonable expectations . '' in 2000 , shortly after its creation , the ntsc issued a report on the crash of silkair flight 185 , where 104 people were killed , which stated that the agency was unable to determine a cause . the united states national transportation safety board criticized the ntsc , stating that the cause of the crash was pilot suicide via a letter sent on december 11 the same year . as part of the september 11 , 2001 attacks , two of the four planes hijacked were united planes . one aircraft was n612ua , a boeing 767 -- 200 operating as united airlines flight 175 , flown into the south tower of the world trade center . the other was n591ua , a boeing 757 -- 222 operating as united airlines flight 93 , which crashed in rural pennsylvania after the passengers fought back against the hijackers , and was suspected to have been directed towards the united states capitol building according to the dhs .
democratic presidential candidate sen. bernie sanders on monday defended his fellow 2020 hopeful rep. tulsi gabbard of hawaii against the claim that she is a `` russian asset , '' saying the suggestion is `` outrageous . '' `` tulsi gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country , '' the vermont independent tweeted . `` people can disagree on issues , but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that tulsi is a foreign asset . '' sanders does not name hillary clinton in the tweet , but his comments appear to be aimed at the 2016 democratic presidential nominee , whose claim last week on a podcast with former obama adviser david plouffe that the russians are `` grooming '' a democrat in the 2020 presidential primary to run as a third-party candidate and champion their interests has caused a backlash . it 's hard for anything to come truly out of left field in a political world in which donald trump is the president of the united states . and yet , when hillary clinton attacked hawaii rep. tulsi gabbard late last week -lrb- although not by name -rrb- , it shocked me . here 's what clinton said in a podcast interview with democratic strategist david plouffe : `` i 'm not making any predictions , but i think they 've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate . she 's the favorite of the russians . '' the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee said thursday that a rancorous white house meeting on syria -- during which top democrats walked out after president donald trump began insulting house speaker nancy pelosi -- was `` belligerent from the get-go . '' `` the meeting started off with the president walking in and slamming down his files on the table , suggesting that this was a meeting he agreed to , but that we had asked for . no one had asked for the meeting . i got an invitation from the white house .
while bubbles may be identifiable in progress , bubbles can be definitively measured only in hindsight after a market correction , which began in 2005 -- 2006 for the u.s. housing market . former u.s. federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan said `` we had a bubble in housing '' , and also said in the wake of the subprime mortgage and credit crisis in 2007 , `` i really did n't get it until very late in 2005 and 2006 . '' in 2001 , alan greenspan dropped interest rates to a low 1 % in order to jump the economy after the ".com '' bubble . it was then bankers and other wall street firms started borrowing money due to its inexpensiveness . home price appreciation has been non-uniform to such an extent that some economists , including former fed chairman alan greenspan , have argued that united states was not experiencing a nationwide housing bubble per se , but a number of local bubbles . however , in 2007 greenspan admitted that there was in fact a bubble in the u.s. housing market , and that `` all the froth bubbles add up to an aggregate bubble '' . alan greenspan was the chairman of the federal reserve of the united states from 1987 to 2006 . he was appointed by president ronald reagan in august 1987 and was reappointed by president bill clinton in 1996 . he was , perhaps , the person most singly responsible for the housing bubble in the u.s. , although he said that `` i really did n't get it until very late in 2005 and 2006 . '' greenspan stated that the housing bubble was `` fundamentally engendered by the decline in real long-term interest rates '' , though he also claims that long-term interest rates are beyond the control of central banks because `` the market value of global long-term securities is approaching $ 100 trillion '' and thus these and other asset markets are large enough that they `` now swamp the resources of central banks '' .
parekh has remained unmarried , claiming that her reputation of being unapproachable made people hesitate in asking for her hand in marriage . in her memoir `` the hit girl '' , she confirmed rumours that she was romantically involved with director nasir hussain who was already married , but out of respect for both their families , she could n't marry him . previously , parekh would only state that she had a longtime boyfriend but declined to elaborate on the relationship , only stating that `` it was nice while it lasted . '' she said she had not seen nasir hussain during the last year of his life , as he became reclusive because of his wife 's death , but she did speak to him the day before he died in 2002 . guru -lrb- madhavan -rrb- wants to be an md for a company under his boss krishna -lrb- abbas -rrb- . krishna is a successful entrepreneur married to sheila -lrb- brinda parekh -rrb- , but his major problem is his playboy nature . guru hopes that krishna will make him an md , so that he can also become a boss and make money . he tries to do everything to please him . malvika goes to the shop to investigate , where the assistant says that her eyesight is perfect , but her vision is very weak . malvika does not realize what he means , but after learning that the assistant did not turn up that day , she realizes that she talked with the killer -lrb- whom she could not see , as the room was dark -rrb- . later , she finds out from the list of customers that a person named amod parekh -lrb- jackie shroff -rrb- , also with eye power -2 , visited the same optical shop on the days when all the three murdered persons visited the shop , and believes him to be the killer .
monsanto , headquartered in creve coeur , missouri , is the largest producer of genetically engineered seed . monsanto has been involved in high-profile lawsuits , as both plaintiff and defendant , and its current and former biotechnology products , its lobbying of government agencies , and its history as a chemical company have made it a controversial corporation . in the united states , the majority of corn , soybean , and cotton is genetically modified . brprior to the march , monsanto 's ceo hugh grant had accused opponents of genetically modified foods of wanting to block others from choosing more affordable food options , thus being guilty of `` elitism '' . in the late 1960s , the monsanto plant in sauget , illinois , was the nation 's largest producer of pcbs , which remained in the water along dead creek there . an epa official referred to sauget as `` one of the most polluted communities in the region '' and `` a soup of different chemicals '' . the monsanto company -lrb- -rrb- was an american agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation founded in 1901 . in 2018 , it was acquired by bayer as part of its crop science division . it was headquartered in creve coeur , missouri . monsanto developed roundup , a glyphosate-based herbicide , in the 1970s , and became a major producer of genetically engineered crops .
the rank of `` general of the army '' has had two incarnations . the rank was introduced in 1866 , the year after the american civil war . it was reserved for the commanding general of the united states army , was a four-star rank , and was held by three different individuals from 1866 to 1888 . the rank was revived as the modern five-star rank during world war ii , and may be awarded to more than one serving officer at a time . the vietnam war is often regarded as a low point for the u.s. army due to the use of drafted personnel , the unpopularity of the war with the u.s. public and frustrating restrictions placed on the military by u.s. political leaders . while u.s. forces had been stationed in south vietnam since 1959 , in intelligence and advising/training roles , they were not deployed in large numbers until 1965 , after the gulf of tonkin incident . u.s. forces effectively established and maintained control of the `` traditional '' battlefield , but they struggled to counter the guerrilla hit and run tactics of the communist viet cong and the north vietnamese army . on a tactical level , u.s. soldiers -lrb- and the u.s. military as a whole -rrb- did not lose a sizable battle . pete geren , secretary of the army , said , `` potential recruits are afforded a unique opportunity through the army experience center to learn what it means to be the best-led , best-trained and best-equipped army in the world by allowing them to virtually experience multiple aspects of the army . '' the head of army recruiting command , major general thomas bostick , called the aec `` a learning laboratory '' -- but not just for those who are thinking of joining . `` it 's incumbent upon the american public to know about their army '' , bostick said . in july 2010 , the army closed the center at the end of its two-year pilot program .
the following year she was nominated for more avn awards , including best supporting actress , for best tease performance , and for her performances in my plaything : shyla stylez and pirates ii . in 2010 , she was named by maxim as one of the 12 top female stars in porn . shyla stylez was inducted into the halls of fame of the urban x awards and the avn in 2011 and 2016 , respectively . the 35th avn awards , presented by adult video news -lrb- avn -rrb- , honored the best pornographic movies and adult entertainment products of between october 1 , 2016 and september 30 , 2017 and took place on january 27 , 2018 at the joint in hard rock hotel and casino , paradise , nevada . during the ceremony , adult video news presented avn awards -lrb- often referred to as the oscars of porn -rrb- in more than 100 categories . webcam star harli lotts and performer/director angela white co-hosted the ceremony , each for the first time . master of ceremonies was comedian aries spears . the 33rd avn awards ceremony , presented by adult video news -lrb- avn -rrb- , honored the best pornographic movies and adult entertainment products of 2015 and took place on january 23 , 2016 at the joint in hard rock hotel and casino , paradise , nevada . during the ceremony , adult video news will present avn awards -lrb- often referred to as the oscars of porn -rrb- in 115 categories released from october 1 , 2014 to september 30 , 2015 . the ceremony , taped to be televised in the united states by showtime , was produced by gary miller . comedian and actress kate quigley co-hosted the show for the first time , joined by adult movie actresses joanna angel and anikka albrite .
on 14 september , ashley made a statement announcing he had put the club up for sale , a day after the first home game since keegan 's resignation , which ashley did not attend , this was a 2 -- 1 defeat to newly promoted hull city . in his statement , ashley stated `` i have listened to you . you want me out . that is what i am now trying to do . '' in november 2018 , wilson starred as the title character alison wilson -- her real-life grandmother -- in the bbc drama mrs wilson . alison wilson was the third of four wives of former mi6 officer and novelist alexander wilson . they were married for 22 years . after his death in 1963 , alison discovered one other wife with whom she collaborated on the funeral . ashley 's ownership of the club was initially popular with fans , despite press scorn for his unconventional approach , by installing chris mort as chairman to run the club , while ashley acted as one of the fans , drinking in local bars and clubs , and watched the team from the stands with the supporters wearing the team shirt . this caused fierce local rivals sunderland to publicly refuse to give ashley permission to wear it in the stadium of light corporate box for the tyne -- wear derby on 10 november . instead of opting for a different attire , ashley chose to take his usual place among the travelling fans for the game . an apparent anomaly with the fans was the choosing ` smith 17 ' as the number of his shirt , after a squad player alan smith he admired and 17 being a lucky number for him .
on the night of the state of the union , an explosion destroys the capitol building , killing the president and everyone in the line of succession except for secretary of housing and urban development thomas kirkman , who had been named the designated survivor . kirkman is immediately sworn in , unaware that the attack is just the beginning of what is to come . in 2015 , secretary of agriculture tom vilsack expressed the desire to resign to president obama . the washington post reports that he said `` there are days when i have literally nothing to do , '' he recalled thinking as he weighed his decision to quit . '' president obama did not accept his resignation but assigned him additional tasks of combating opioid addiction , a task usually not assigned to the department of agriculture . kiefer sutherland joined the cast in december 2015 , playing tom kirkman , the united states secretary of housing and urban development who suddenly becomes president of the united states . sutherland had no intention of returning to television ; he read the first script of the series and changed his mind , saying , `` i remember getting to the end of the script and thinking i was potentially holding the next 10 years of my life in my hands .

on the day that president donald trump announced the death of abu bakr al-baghdadi , the parents of kayla mueller , who was kidnapped and reportedly raped by the isis leader , say they are feeling a `` roller coaster of emotions . '' `` well , it 's a roller coaster of emotions whenever this ugly situation raises its head , but it 's become part of our life over the last five and a half years , '' kayla 's father carl mueller told cnn in a phone interview sunday afternoon . in 2012 , kayla traveled to the turkey/syria border to work with the danish refugee council and the humanitarian organization support to life , which assisted families forced to flee their homes . she was taken hostage by isis in aleppo , syria , in 2013 after she visited a spanish msf -lrb- doctors without borders -rrb- hospital . president donald trump asserted in his televised address from the white house sunday that isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi was `` whimpering and crying '' before ultimately detonating his suicide vest in a tunnel as us commandos closed in . trump painted the isis leader as a coward , describing in great detail how he `` spent his last moments in utter fear , in total panic and dread , terrified of the american forces bearing down on him . '' `` he died like a dog . ... the world is now a much safer place , '' he added . there are good dogs -- and then there are hero dogs who chase down the world 's top terrorist to his fatal demise . president donald trump said that a dog , part of the us operation that resulted in the death of isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi over the weekend , was injured while chasing baghdadi down a dead-end tunnel . trump declassified a photo of the dog on monday afternoon , tweeting , `` we have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog -lrb- name not declassified -rrb- that did such a great job in capturing and killing the leader of isis , abu bakr al-baghdadi ! '' the dog is believed to have been sent down the tunnel after it was feared that baghdadi was wearing a suicide vest .
the adjustment from living in the country to the city was troubling for cleary , and she struggled in school ; in first grade , her teacher placed her in a group for struggling readers . cleary said , `` the first grade was separated into three reading groups -- bluebirds , redbirds , and blackbirds . i was a blackbird . to be a blackbird was to be disgraced . the fernwood area was part of the territory originally inhabited by the songhees prior to the establishment of fort victoria . it is believed that a songhees village may have been located at what is today cadboro bay . with the establishment of fort victoria , a trail linking the fort to cadboro bay ran through the area that would become fernwood and was used by aboriginals and europeans . bishop edward cridge described the area as it was in the 1850s as `` open country without a house or field till we arrived at the company 's farm '' . pat pflieger , professor of children 's literature at west chester university , commented : `` cleary 's books have lasted because she understands her audience . she knows they 're sometimes confused or frightened by the world around them , and that they feel deeply about things that adults can dismiss . '' eliza dresang , professor in children and youth services at the university of washington information school said , `` those books do n't seem so radical now , but they were when she was writing them . '' dresang also said the topics covered were portrayed with honesty and accuracy .
production on the sixth and final season of `` house of cards '' has been halted after star kevin spacey was accused of sexual assault by an actor who claims he was a minor at the time of the alleged incident . netflix and media rights capital , which produces the series , confirmed the move in a joint statement issued tuesday . `` mrc and netflix have decided to suspend production on ` house of cards ' season six , until further notice , to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew , '' the statement read . on sunday , actor anthony rapp told buzzfeed about an alleged encounter with spacey at a party in 1986 . on october 11 , 2017 , the baltimore sun reported that house of cards had been renewed for a sixth season and that filming would begin by the end of october 2017 . on october 29 , actor anthony rapp publicly stated that lead actor spacey had made a sexual advance on him at a 1986 party when rapp was 14 . the following day , netflix announced that the upcoming sixth season of house of cards would be its last . multiple sources stated that the decision to end the series was made prior to rapp 's accusation , but the announcement nevertheless caused suspicions for its timing . in the midst of the allegations , filming was suspended on the sixth and final season of house of cards . media rights capital -lrb- mrc -rrb- , the production company behind the show , stated that it had implemented `` an anonymous complaint hotline , crisis counselors , and sexual harassment legal advisors for the crew .

japan has given a stark warning to britain that its big companies -- and others -- would have to quit the country if trade barriers after brexit wipe out their profit margins . after meeting prime minister theresa may with a delegation of top japanese executives , japan 's ambassador to the u.k. , koji tsuruoka , was asked about the threat of new obstacles to trade between britain and the european union , the country 's biggest export market . `` if there is no profitability of continuing operations in the u.k. - not japanese only - then no private company can continue operations , '' he told reporters . `` so it is as simple as that , '' the official added . japan 's princess mako and her commoner fiance kei komuro have postponed their highly anticipated engagement and wedding until at least 2020 , saying they were not yet ready for marriage . the wedding , which had been set for november , was to be a momentous occasion for the country and the japanese royal family , led by emperor akihito , who plans to abdicate in april 2019 . but the couple said they were now having second thoughts about marrying so soon . `` it is because of our immaturity and we just regret it , '' the couple said in a statement tuesday . japan already has the world 's smartest toilets , but now there are smart shoes , furniture and accessories . you might remember nissan 's 2016 marketing maneuver , when the japanese carmaker introduced a line of self-driving chairs that could autonomously glide together using cameras and sensors . this time , the auto innovators have taken aim at traditional hospitality and everyday objects . drawing from the autonomous parking technology of the nissan leaf car , which debuted in october , the propilot park ryokan hotel comes kitted out with all kinds of intuitive amenities .
the division of fish and wildlife was part of the original department of conservation . originally called the fish and game division , it was created to manage , protect and regulate the state 's fish and wildlife resource . this division manages all of the lands acquired by the department of natural resources . an example of this is on sister lakes , lake maria and lake sarah , in murray country where the dnr bought 640 acres -lrb- 2.6 km2 -rrb- of land between the two lakes to help improve water quality . in 2009 , governor jennifer granholm moved to merge department of environmental quality back into the department and appoint the reunited department 's director instead of the natural resources commission . the state merged the two agencies to form the department of natural resources and environment . in 2010 , however , governor elect rick snyder has named rodney stokes as the new dnr director , and has chosen to divide the dnre into the original designations of natural resource commission and the dnr divisions . rodney stokes says his first priority is to reverse the decline of hunting in michigan , by eliminating the extended seasons , reducing the amount of antlerless licenses in northern michigan , improving habitat and removing license requirements for coyote and wolf . the mission of the wdnr is `` to protect and enhance our natural resources : our air , land and water ; our wildlife , fish and forests and the ecosystems that sustain all life . to provide a healthy , sustainable environment and a full range of outdoor opportunities . to ensure the right of all people to use and enjoy these resources in their work and leisure . to work with people to understand each other 's views and to carry out the public will .
on april 1963 , duk sung son traveled to the united states of america , where he started to teach tae kwon do or `` korean karate '' as it was called then . his first classes were outdoors at central park in manhattan and at the basement of downtown synagogue in new york city . at the end of 1963 he established regular classes monday through friday from 6 to 8 pm in his first gym , located at 162 7th corner of 21st street in new york city . health and longevity of practitioners are the major goals of tang soo do practice . consequently , serious injuries are counterproductive because they retard a level of physical training that is needed to foster emotional and intellectual growth . however , minor injuries , such as bumps , bruises and the occasional loss of wind may be invaluable experiences . each match should begin and end with respect , compassion and a deep appreciation for the opponent . kwon was born in andong in what is now south korea . his first exposure to the martial arts was at the age of seven , when he began studying taekwondo . during that period of time , following the korean war , korea was in a period of rebuilding its physical and cultural landscape . formal dojangs , had not yet been constructed .
upon learning years later of the existence , contents and alleged burning of the diary , prosecutor alfred hantman and defense attorney dovey johnson roundtree , as well as d.c. police detective bernie crooke , stated that knowledge of that information at the time of the trial would have materially affected the proceedings . `` i 'd have been very upset at the time if i 'd known that the deceased 's diary had been destroyed , '' crooke told author ron rosenbaum in 1976 . in a 1991 interview with the late author leo damore , hantman said that he had been `` totally unaware of who mary meyer was or what her connections were , '' and that having that knowledge `` could have changed everything . '' in her 2009 autobiography , justice older than the law , defense counsel dovey roundtree expressed shock at learning of the diary 's significance from bradlee 's book . according to leary , meyer had sought him out for the purpose of learning how to conduct lsd sessions with these powerful men , including , she strongly implied , president john f. kennedy , who was then her lover . leary alleged that pinchot meyer told him she had shared in this plan with at least seven other washington socialite friends who held similar political views and were trying to supply lsd to a small circle of high-ranking government officials . leary also claimed that pinchot meyer had asked him for help while in a state of fear for her own life after the assassination of president kennedy . october 1963 , one month before his assassination , kennedy wrote a letter to mary meyer , imploring her to join him for a tryst . the unsent letter , written on white house stationery and retained by kennedy 's personal secretary evelyn lincoln , sold in june 2016 at auction for just under $ 89,000 . the letter reads : `` why do n't you leave suburbia for once -- come and see me -- either here -- or at the cape next week or in boston the 19th . i know it is unwise , irrational , and that you may hate it -- on the other hand you may not -- and i will love it .
in the us , the endangered species act of 1973 was passed to protect us species deemed in danger of extinction . the concern at the time was that the country was losing species that were scientifically , culturally , and educationally important . in the same year , the convention on international trade in endangered species of fauna and flora -lrb- cites -rrb- was passed as part of an international agreement to prevent the global trade of endangered wildlife . in 1980 , the world conservation strategy was developed by the iucn with help from the un environmental programme , world wildlife fund , un food and agricultural organization , and unesco . the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- is an international non-governmental organization founded in 1961 , working in the field of wilderness preservation , and the reduction of human impact on the environment . it was formerly named the world wildlife fund , which remains its official name in canada and the united states.wwf is the world 's largest conservation organization with over five million supporters worldwide , working in more than 100 countries , supporting around 3000 conservation and environmental projects . they have invested over $ 1 billion in more than 12,000 conservation initiatives since 1995 . wwf is a foundation with 55 % of funding from individuals and bequests , 19 % from government sources -lrb- such as the world bank , dfid , usaid -rrb- and 8 % from corporations in 2014 . wwf aims to `` stop the degradation of the planet 's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature . '' wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting wild species and their habitats in order to prevent species from going extinct . major threats to wildlife include habitat destruction/degradation/fragmentation , overexploitation , poaching , pollution and climate change . the iucn estimates that 27,000 species of the ones assessed are at risk for extinction . expanding to all existing species , a 2019 un report on biodiversity put this estimate even higher at a million species .
the united states has a presidential system of government , which means that the executive and legislature are elected separately . article one of the united states constitution requires that any election for the u.s. president must occur on a single day throughout the country ; elections for congressional offices , however , can be held at different times . congressional and presidential elections take place simultaneously every four years , and the intervening congressional elections , which take place every two years , are called midterm elections . ballot access refers to the laws which regulate under what conditions access is granted for a candidate or political party to appear on voters ' ballots . each state has its own ballot access laws to determine who may appear on ballots and who may not . according to article i , section 4 , of the united states constitution , the authority to regulate the time , place , and manner of federal elections is up to each state , unless congress legislates otherwise . depending on the office and the state , it may be possible for a voter to cast a write-in vote for a candidate whose name does not appear on the ballot , but it is extremely rare for such a candidate to win office . the court also rejected the argument that congress had exceeded its authority to regulate elections under article i , section 4 of the constitution . the court found that the law only affected state elections in which federal candidates were involved and also that it did not prevent states from creating separate election laws for state and local elections .
in tuesday night 's democratic presidential debate , i 'm afraid most of the candidates blended into the stage for me at some point . but that does n't mean there was n't a star among them . here 's how each candidate performed : bernie sanders : a throughout the three-hour event , sen. sanders was consistently sharper than normal , and he outperformed the others , especially elizabeth warren , when explaining the financials of his healthcare plan . i liked his attitude about his health : we can judge it by watching him take the campaign by storm . sen. lindsey graham is frantic . `` he 's making the biggest mistake of his presidency , '' the south carolina republican tells reporters in the halls of congress . president donald trump is annoyed . `` i think lindsey should focus right now on judiciary -- like the democrats -- the do-nothing democrats , '' he tells reporters in the east room of the white house . a dozen -lrb- ! -rrb- democratic presidential candidates took the stage in ohio for the fourth debate of the 2020 election , the largest field ever to participate in a single debate . i watched , took notes , tweeted and picked some of the best -- and the worst -- of the night . my winners and losers are below .

clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 democratic presidential nomination . before the new hampshire primary , tabloid publications printed allegations that bill clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with gennifer flowers . in response , the clintons appeared together on 60 minutes , where bill denied the affair , but acknowledged `` causing pain in my marriage '' . this joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign . the nature of the contest fractured in the next few days . several remarks by bill clinton and other surrogates , and a remark by hillary clinton concerning martin luther king jr. and lyndon b. johnson , were perceived by many as , accidentally or intentionally , limiting obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign . despite attempts by both hillary and obama to downplay the issue , democratic voting became more polarized as a result , with clinton losing much of her support among african americans . she lost by a two-to-one margin to obama in the january 26 south carolina primary , setting up , with edwards soon dropping out , an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two february 5 super tuesday states . clinton and obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles ; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president . clinton formed an alliance with secretary of defense gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks . obama and clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological , pragmatic exercise . she met with him weekly but did not have the close , daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents ; moreover , certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the white house or pentagon .

'' `` in all fairness , i do n't want it to sound trivial , nbc renewed ` the apprentice , ' because we had a great season last season . and they would love me not to be doing this , i will tell you right now , '' trump said . the odds are too small to calculate that donald trump will become president of the united states . the fact that he 's doing well in early new hampshire polls , however , may spur some sales of tranquilizers among the political class . trump keeps reminding us that he 'll bring sound business principles to the federal government . but he has failed so many times there are top 10 lists on the internet of his biggest screw-ups .

the university of california 's second president , daniel coit gilman , opened its new campus in berkeley in september 1873 . earlier that year , toland medical college in san francisco -lrb- founded in 1864 -rrb- had agreed to become the university 's `` medical department '' ; it later evolved into ucsf . in 1878 , the university established hastings college of the law in san francisco as its first law school . the california constitution was amended to designate hastings as the `` law department '' of the university of california in consideration of a $ 100,000 gift from serranus clinton hastings -lrb- though this was later transferred to statutory law during the shortening of what had become an extraordinarily long constitution by the 1960s -rrb- . during the 20th century , neuroscience began to be recognized as a distinct academic discipline in its own right , rather than as studies of the nervous system within other disciplines . eric kandel and collaborators have cited david rioch , francis o. schmitt , and stephen kuffler as having played critical roles in establishing the field . rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the walter reed army institute of research , starting in the 1950s . during the same period , schmitt established a neuroscience research program within the biology department at the massachusetts institute of technology , bringing together biology , chemistry , physics , and mathematics . eric kandel and collaborators have cited david rioch , francis o. schmitt , and stephen kuffler as having played critical roles in establishing the field . rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the walter reed army institute of research , starting in the 1950s . during the same period , schmitt established a neuroscience research program within the biology department at the massachusetts institute of technology , bringing together biology , chemistry , physics , and mathematics . the first freestanding neuroscience department -lrb- then called psychobiology -rrb- was founded in 1964 at the university of california , irvine by james l. mcgaugh .
wyatt earp was one of the few men i personally knew in the west in the early days whom i regarded as absolutely destitute of physical fear . i have often remarked , and i am not alone in my conclusions , that what goes for courage in a man is generally fear of what others will think of him -- in other words , personal bravery is largely made up of self-respect , egotism , and apprehension of the opinions of others . wyatt earp 's daring and apparent recklessness in time of danger is wholly characteristic ; personal fear does n't enter into the equation , and when everything is said and done , i believe he values his own opinion of himself more than that of others , and it is his own good report he seeks to preserve ... he never at any time in his career resorted to the pistol excepting cases where such a course was absolutely necessary . the verb `` wyatting '' appeared in some blogs and music magazines to describe the practice of playing unusual tracks , in particular songs from wyatt 's album dondestan , on a pub jukebox to annoy the other pub goers . wyatt was quoted in 2006 in the guardian as saying `` i think it 's really funny '' and `` i 'm very honoured at the idea of becoming a verb . '' when asked if he would ever try it himself , he said : `` i do n't really like disconcerting people , but even when i try to be normal i disconcert anyway . '' however , alfreda benge said it made her angry `` that robert should be used as a means of clever dicks asserting their superiority in pubs ... just five days after it was announced that brooks had joined the cast , it was also announced that rena sofer , known for her portrayal of lois cerullo on general hospital was cast in the role of wyatt 's mother , quinn fuller . according to brooks , wyatt 's world is `` rocked '' by the revelation of his paternity . at the time , wyatt has just `` poured his heart and soul into pursuing hope , '' only for her to reject him for liam . what hurts the most is that quinn lied to him about his father .
joi ito , the director of the media lab at mit , resigned saturday and the university is calling for an independent investigation following explosive allegations that he and at least one other person at the lab made efforts to make sure jeffrey epstein 's name was not associated with donations he made or helped solicit . internal communications and documents obtained by cnn -- first reported by the new yorker -- show epstein was integral to incoming donations from major donors , including $ 2 million from bill gates and at least $ 5 million from leon black , the founder of private equity firm apollo global management . ito submitted his resignation saturday as lab director and as a professor , according to a statement from mit president l. rafael reif . his statement referenced the new yorker piece , saying `` because the accusations in the story are extremely serious , they demand an immediate , thorough and independent investigation .

in response to the september 11 terrorist attacks , bush launched a `` war on terror '' that began with the war in afghanistan in 2001 and later expanded to the iraq war in 2003 . signature legislation passed during his presidency included broad tax cuts , the patriot act , the no child left behind act , the partial-birth abortion ban act , the medicare modernization act , and funding for the aids relief program known as pepfar . in the 2004 presidential race , bush defeated democratic senator john kerry in a close election . after his re-election , bush received criticism from across the political spectrum for his handling of the iraq war , hurricane katrina , and other challenges . in the 2004 democratic presidential primaries , john kerry defeated several democratic rivals , including sen. john edwards -lrb- d-north carolina -rrb- , former vermont governor howard dean and retired army general wesley clark . his victory in the iowa caucuses is widely believed to be the tipping point where kerry revived his sagging campaign in new hampshire and the february 3 , 2004 , primary states like arizona , south carolina and new mexico . kerry then went on to win landslide victories in nevada and wisconsin . kerry thus won the democratic nomination to run for president of the united states against incumbent george w. bush . in his 2004 presidential campaign , kerry criticized george w. bush for the iraq war . he and his running mate , u.s. senator from north carolina john edwards , lost the election , finishing 35 electoral votes behind bush and vice president dick cheney . kerry returned to the senate , becoming chairman of the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship in 2007 and then of the foreign relations committee in 2009 .

'' early in the 2004 presidential campaign , edwards became the first family member of the democratic candidates to state that she was in favor of legalizing gay marriage . on september 30 , 2007 , during a campaign stop with actor james denton , she was quoted by cnn as saying : `` i 'm on my mom 's side with this , not my dad 's . it 's the word ` marriage ' that he is hung up on '' . the news organization then went on to state in its report that john edwards `` does not support gay marriage , but his wife , elizabeth , does '' . in august 2008 , senior figures in the democratic party warned that edwards ' failure to respond to the allegations could affect his role at the 2008 democratic convention . according to don fowler , former democratic national committee chair , `` if there is not an explanation that 's satisfactory , acceptable and meets high moral standards , the answer is ` no , ' would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention .

washington political consultant w. samuel patten , who helped steer foreign money to president donald trump 's inauguration , was sentenced to probation without jail time in another criminal case that grew out of robert mueller 's investigation into russian and ukrainian influence in american politics and the 2016 presidential election . specifically , he will serve three years probation , pay a $ 5,000 fine and do 500 hours of `` hands on '' community service , the judge said . patten , 47 , who pleaded guilty last august , has contributed to additional , still unknown investigations , highlighting the constellation of cases to grow out of mueller 's work and how some aspects of the russia probe continue . as part of his plea deal , patten admitted to seeking tickets to trump 's inauguration on behalf of a ukrainian oligarch , according to court documents , and ultimately paid $ 50,000 for four tickets . lobbyist sam patten provided `` substantial assistance '' to special counsel robert mueller and several other ongoing investigations , federal prosecutors said monday , paving the way for him to potentially avoid jail time at his sentencing this week . the case has been full of intrigue from the beginning , given patten 's connections to several prongs of mueller 's investigation . he founded a company with a suspected russian operative , steered foreign money to president donald trump 's inauguration , was closely tied to trump campaign chair paul manafort , and advised the controversial data firm cambridge analytica . prosecutors from the us attorney 's office in washington did n't recommend a sentence for patten , who first came under investigation by mueller 's team . robert mueller 's team declined to prosecute donald trump jr. and other members of the campaign for campaign finance violations for their participation in the june 2016 meeting at trump tower , in part , because they could n't prove that they `` willfully '' violated the law . `` taking into account the high burden to establish a culpable mental state in a campaign-finance prosecution and the difficulty in establishing the required valuation , the office decided not to pursue criminal campaign-finance charges against trump jr. or other campaign officials for the events culminating in the june 9 meeting , '' mueller 's team explained . `` the office ultimately concluded that , even if the principal legal questions were resolved favorably to the government , a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that campaign officials or individuals connected to the campaign willfully violated the law , '' the team continues . on june 9 , 2016 , trump jr. , jared kushner , and then-campaign chairman paul manafort met with russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya at trump tower .
former vice president joe biden is preparing for a lengthy democratic primary battle despite his status as the front-runner in national polls , senior campaign aides said tuesday . biden could withstand a loss in iowa because of his strength among minority voters in the more diverse states that follow it in the presidential nominating process , the aides said . `` we expect this to be a fight . we expect this to go for a while , '' a senior campaign aide said during a call briefing reporters on biden 's approach to the campaign this fall . in march 2018 , politico reported that biden 's team was considering a number of options to distinguish their campaign , such as announcing at the outset a younger vice presidential candidate from outside of politics , and also reported that biden had rejected a proposition to commit to serving only one term as president . on july 17 , 2018 , he told a forum held in bogota , colombia , that he would decide if he would formally declare as a candidate by january 2019 . on february 4 , with no decision having been forthcoming from biden , edward-isaac dovere of the atlantic wrote that biden was `` very close to saying yes '' but that some close to him are worried he will have a last-minute change of heart , as he did in 2016 . dovere reported that biden was concerned about the effect another presidential run could have on his family and reputation , as well as fundraising struggles and perceptions about his age and relative centrism compared to other declared and potential candidates . with a story he likes to tell on the campaign trail , former vice president joe biden has once again triggered anxiety about his campaign . biden loves to share a memory about traveling to afghanistan as vice president to mark the heroic actions of a navy captain who did n't want the honor . the problem , according to the washington post , is that `` almost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect . ...
donald trump on friday had an unusual encounter with a protester . a protester in the seats behind trump on friday lifted a sign that read `` islamophobia is not the answer . '' but even after a trump supporter ripped the sign away , the man lingered not far from trump 's stage . waiting for security , police or staff to spring into action , trump paced the stage and came close to the man , who had removed a jacket to reveal a shirt with the words `` kkk endorses trump '' and a yellow star reminiscent of those worn by jews during the holocaust on his chest . nascar 's chief executive and several nascar drivers endorsed donald trump on monday , just one day before a cluster of southern states vote in the gop 's super tuesday contests . brian france , the racing association 's ceo , appeared monday alongside trump during a rally at valdosta state university , touting the republican front-runner 's success in his business and personal life . `` you know about his winning in business and success . i 'm gon na tell you , he wins with his family , '' said france , who noted that he 's known trump for more than two decades . on the raw is war after austin won the wwf world heavyweight championship , vince mcmahon presented him with a new title belt and warned austin that he did not approve of his rebellious nature and that things could be done `` the easy way or the hard way '' . austin gave his answer in the form of another stone cold stunner . this led to a segment a week later where austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to `` play ball '' with mcmahon , appearing in a suit and tie , with a beaming mcmahon taking a picture of himself and his new corporate champion . the entire thing was a ruse by austin who in the course of the segment proceeded to tear off the suit , tell mcmahon it was the last time he would see austin dressed like this , punch his boss in the `` corporate grapefruits '' and take another picture of the two of them while mcmahon was doubled over in pain .

some opponents of obama 's presidential eligibility claim that he was born in kenya and was therefore not born a united states citizen . whether obama having been born outside the u.s. would have invalidated his u.s. citizenship at birth is debated . political commentator andrew malcolm , of the los angeles times , wrote that obama would still be eligible for the presidency , regardless of where he was born , because his mother was an american citizen , saying that obama 's mother `` could have been on mars when wee barry emerged and he 'd still be american . '' a contrary view is promoted by ucla law professor eugene volokh , who has said that in the hypothetical scenario that obama was born outside the u.s. , he would not be a natural-born citizen , since the then-applicable law would have required obama 's mother to have been in the u.s. at least `` five years after the age of 14 '' , but ann dunham was three months shy of her 19th birthday when obama was born . during barack obama 's campaign for president in 2008 , throughout his presidency , and afterwards , a number of conspiracy theories falsely asserted obama was ineligible to be president of the united states because he was not a natural-born citizen of the u.s. as required by article two of the constitution . obama is not the first president to be the subject of controversy surrounding the location of his birth . andrew jackson was the subject of similar claims , although it is not certain that they were raised during his presidency . some said that chester a. arthur was born outside the united states , with his birth records later allegedly falsified to show he was born in vermont .

'' finally , wolf blitzer -lrb- who conducted the original 1999 interview -rrb- stated in 2008 that : gore had a chance to fulfill this promise when he and president clinton participated in john gage 's netday '96 on march 9 , 1996 . clinton and gore spent the day at ygnacio valley high school , as part of the drive to connect california public schools to the internet . in a speech given at yvh , clinton stated that he was excited to see that his challenge the previous september to `` californians to connect at least 20 percent of your schools to the information superhighway by the end of this school year '' was met . clinton also described this event as part of a time of `` absolutely astonishing transformation ; a moment of great possibility .
republican lawmakers have finally unveiled a plan to repeal major portions of obamacare , capping years of attacks against the health care law and a months-long debate that exposed deep rifts within the gop . now comes the hard part . house republican leaders must begin in earnest the tough task of selling the new plan to overhaul america 's health care system to colleagues in both chambers on capitol hill , where there is a myriad of clashing interests . and they will have to convince a skeptical public it 's worthwhile , just seven years after congress passed the affordable care act . republican leadership 's first effort to sell an obamacare replacement plan has given rise to an unusual consensus in washington . officials on both sides of the aisle -- including disparate factions within parties -- and influential outside groups seem to be in agreement : the bill in its current form will never make it to the white house . president donald trump on tuesday nodded to the long road ahead . `` our wonderful new healthcare bill is now out for review and negotiation , '' he tweeted , while also calling obamacare `` a complete and total disaster . '' the second-ranking republican senate leader says a bill to repeal and replace obamacare is not expected to go to the the chamber 's committees of jurisdiction for their imprint , although it will be open to amendment on the floor . speaking to reporters in the capitol , sen. john cornyn of texas said there has already been a great deal of house and senate negotiating and he considers the gop-introduced bill monday a product of the house and senate . `` probably straight to the floor , '' cornyn said when asked by cnn about the process . `` because there has already been a lot of consultations on a bicameral basis to get us here . ''
however , not all critics were impressed . lee siegel sees as much of dave eggers in the novel as deng , unable to tell the two apart , saying `` how strange for one man to think that he could write the story of another man , a real living man who is perfectly capable of telling his story himself -- and then call it an autobiography . '' beth lives on her own at first , and toph becomes eggers 's responsibility . eggers , a man only in his early 20s , has to raise a child as if he were his own . eggers 's life can no longer involve things many 20-year-olds would like to do . for example , eggers can not stay out of the house all night at the bar and bring home a different girl every week , something which he talks about wanting to do in his book in detail . the concept of bernard owning a bookshop came about because of moran 's view of bookshops as doomed enterprises . moran said `` running a second-hand bookshop is a guaranteed commercial failure . it 's a whole philosophy . there were bookshops that i frequented and i was always struck by the loneliness and doggedness of these men who piloted this death ship '' , while linehan said his belligerent personality reflected a sign he once saw in a bookshop stating `` please put the books anywhere you like because we 've got nothing better to do than put them back '' .
voters in california will have the opportunity in november to say the state should be carved up into three parts . three californias is the ballot initiative pipe dream of a golden state venture capitalist . congress , however , will never sign on . but ... maine voters will conduct a groundbreaking democratic experiment on tuesday when they use , for the first time in the nation , ranked choice voting in statewide primaries . the consequences of maine 's experiment could be momentous , with the potential to change campaigns , enliven third-party candidacies , and if successful , serve as proof-of-concept for the system at scale . the system was adopted through a voter referendum in 2016 and has survived a series of legal challenges in the intervening years , while emerging as a flashpoint in the state 's politics . here 's how it works , according to the committee for ranked choice voting , which helped campaign for the referendum : `` ranked choice voting gives you the power to rank candidates from your favorite to your least favorite . people from maine -lrb- mainers or maineiacs -- either is acceptable -rrb- have been outraged at the election of governor paul lepage for many years , with bumper stickers dotting the state , with simply `` 61 % . '' this sticker was created after lepage won the governorship with only 38 % of the vote in 2010 , the third lowest non-independent gubernatorial win since 1990 . the bumper sticker was a way to signify that the person was part of a large majority that did n't vote the governor into office . on tuesday evening , mainers voted to veto the state legislature and immediately implement ranked choice voting , a measure that would allow voters to rank the candidates they would like in office .
before the early 1930s , the miami university nicknames were interchangeable , including the miami boys , the big reds , and the reds and whites . the first glimpse of the miami university redskins was in 1928 , when a miami student referred to their team as the big red-skinned warriors . by 1931 , the redskins had stuck as the miami university nickname , and was the official nickname of the miami university athletics program for nearly seventy years . tom holland , who plays parker in the marvel cinematic universe , praised the film as `` one of the coolest films ever seen , '' while holland 's mcu co-star chris pratt , who also worked with lord and miller in the lego movie films , called it an `` emotionally moving , cutting edge , progressive , diverse , funny , meta , action-packed , silly , visually stunning masterpiece ! '' patton oswalt , who also worked with lord and miller on 22 jump street , called the film `` brilliant '' and continued `` this has been a non-stop year for me and i 'm glad i 'm ending it in such a cinematic high-note . not only is it the best superhero film ever made , it 's flat-out a game-changing movie . seeing it again tomorrow ! '' fr . john fulton , a jesuit instructor in a seminary school , feels he has lost his vocation . a talk with his friend fr . marc arnoux is no help .
on january 26 , 1954 , faced with getting swallowed up by a rapidly expanding san jose , milpitas residents incorporated as a city that included the recently built ford auto assembly plant . when san jose attempted to annex milpitas barely seven years later , the `` milpitas minutemen '' were quickly organized to oppose annexation and keep milpitas independent . an overwhelming majority of milpitas registered voters voted `` no '' to annexation in the 1961 election as a result of a vigorous anti-annexation campaign . following the election , the anti-annexation committee , who had compared themselves to the revolutionary war minutemen who fought the british on lexington green -- a role filled in this case by the neighboring city of san jose - adopted the image of daniel chester french 's minuteman statue , that stands near the site of the old north bridge in concord , ma , as part of the official city seal . according to the book the color of law by richard rothstein -lrb- 2017 -rrb- , when the ford plant moved from richmond to milpitas in 1953 , the town incorporated in order to pass laws that would exclude african american workers from residing there . `` union leaders met with ford executives and negotiated an agreement permitting all 1400 richmond plant workers , including the approximately 250 african americans , to transfer to the new facility . once ford 's plans became known , milpitas residents incorporated the town and passed an emergency ordinance permitting the newly installed city council to ban apartment construction and allow only single family homes . ... in february , 2018 , phan rebuked the city 's planning director bradley misner during a live council meeting . while discussing a council item pertaining to a study of retail spaces in milpitas ' midtown area , misner told the council that conducting the study would require `` strategy and coordination '' between his own department and the city 's economic development department . phan expressed that he had `` no confidence '' in misner 's ability to accomplish said coordination , warning misner : `` the next time that we 'll be having a conversation about coordination or strategy , will be agendized as a public employee performance evaluation . '' after city attorney chris diaz then pointed out to the council that the only employees the council has hiring and firing authority over are the city attorney and city manager , phan responded , `` i do n't care . '' following comments from the acting city manager dianne thompson , phan replied , `` i do n't care what position is listed for the public employee performance evaluation .
during the 2008 democratic presidential primary campaign , clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife , hillary . through speaking engagements and fundraisers , he was able to raise $ 10 million toward her campaign . some worried that as an ex-president , he was too active on the trail , too negative to clinton rival barack obama , and alienating his supporters at home and abroad . many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the south carolina primary , which obama won . instant search was announced in september 2010 as a feature that displayed suggested results while the user typed in their search query . the primary advantage of the new system was its ability to save time , with marissa mayer , then-vice president of search products and user experience , proclaiming that the feature would save 2 -- 5 seconds per search , elaborating that `` that may not seem like a lot at first , but it adds up . with google instant , we estimate that we 'll save our users 11 hours with each passing second ! '' matt van wagner of search engine land wrote that `` personally , i kind of like google instant and i think it represents a natural evolution in the way search works '' , and also praised google 's efforts in public relations , writing that `` with just a press conference and a few well-placed interviews , google has parlayed this relatively minor speed improvement into an attention-grabbing front-page news story '' . clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 democratic presidential nomination . before the new hampshire primary , tabloid publications printed allegations that bill clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with gennifer flowers . in response , the clintons appeared together on 60 minutes , where bill denied the affair , but acknowledged `` causing pain in my marriage '' . this joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign .
after arriving in london from paris , adams had his first audience with king george iii on june 1 , which he meticulously recorded in a letter to foreign minister jay the next day . the pair 's exchange was respectful ; adams promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality `` between people who , tho seperated by an ocean and under different governments have the same language , a similar religion and kindred blood , '' and the king agreed to `` receive with pleasure , the assurances of the friendly dispositions of the united states . '' the king added that although `` he had been the last to consent '' to american independence , he wanted adams to know that he had always done what he thought was right . towards its end , he startled adams by commenting that `` there is an opinion , among some people , that you are not the most attached of all your countrymen , to the manners of france . '' the ancient greek philosopher anaxagoras -lrb- d. 428 bc -rrb- reasoned that the sun and moon were both giant spherical rocks , and that the latter reflected the light of the former . his non-religious view of the heavens was one cause for his imprisonment and eventual exile . in his little book on the face in the moon 's orb , plutarch suggested that the moon had deep recesses in which the light of the sun did not reach and that the spots are nothing but the shadows of rivers or deep chasms . he also entertained the possibility that the moon was inhabited . news of the opening hostilities with the british at the battles of lexington and concord made adams hope that independence would soon become a reality . three days after the battle , he rode into a militia camp and , while reflecting positively on the high spirits of the men , was distressed by their poor condition and lack of discipline . a month later , adams returned to philadelphia for the second continental congress as the leader of the massachusetts delegation . he moved cautiously at first , noting that the congress was divided between loyalists , those favoring independence , and those hesitant to take any position .
on november 1 , 2006 , bush stated he would stand by rumsfeld as defense secretary for the length of his term as president . rumsfeld wrote a resignation letter dated november 6 , and , per the stamp on the letter , bush saw it on election day , november 7 . in the elections , the house and the senate shifted to democratic control . after the elections , on november 8 , bush announced rumsfeld would resign his position as secretary of defense . cheney has said his time at the pentagon was the most rewarding period of his public service career , calling it `` the one that stands out . '' in 2014 , cheney recounted that when he met with president george h. w. bush to accept the offer , he passed a painting in the private residence entitled the peacemakers , which depicted president lincoln , general grant , and william tecumseh sherman . `` my great-grandfather had served under william tecumseh sherman throughout the war , '' cheney said , `` and it occurred to me as i was in the room as i walked in to talk to the president about becoming secretary of defense , i wondered what he would have thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the white house with the president talking about taking over the reins of the u.s. military . '' in 2011 , peters criticized former defense secretary donald rumsfeld , saying : `` i am allergic to rumsfeld . we did a great thing in iraq , but we did it very badly . he is an extremely talented man but he has the tragic flaw of hubris . his arrogance is unbearable .
mccain turned his attention to the november general election , while the democratic primaries continued to be a battle between clinton and obama . mccain faced the challenge of staying in the news as the democrats garnered headlines with their protracted nomination battle , which showed no signs of ending before the democratic national convention in late august . however , having the nomination locked up early also gave mccain time to build a national organization and put his general election strategy into action for the six months leading up to the republican national convention . mccain planned to raise money and visit several sites in the u.s. before embarking on a tour of europe and the middle east as part of a congressional delegation . mccain 's decision to choose sarah palin as his running mate was criticized ; new york times journalist david brooks said that `` he took a disease that was running through the republican party -- anti-intellectualism , disrespect for facts -- and he put it right at the centre of the party '' . laura mcgann in vox says that mccain gave the `` reality tv politics '' and tea party movement more political legitimacy , as well as solidifying `` the republican party 's comfort with a candidate who would say absurdities ... unleashing a political style and a values system that animated the tea party movement and laid the groundwork for a trump presidency . '' although mccain later expressed regret for not choosing the independent senator joe lieberman as his vp candidate instead , he consistently defended palin 's performances at his events . by the time the 2008 primary season began , mccain 's media coverage had shifted and he was now viewed as a `` comeback '' story . in addition , mccain returned to his long-standing practice of granting almost unlimited media access to him on this bus ; this as well as the notion that he engages in `` straight talk '' free of political calculation gave him a positive personal sentiment in the press . reflecting this feeling , msnbc 's joe scarborough joked of the media , `` i think every last one of them would move to massachusetts and marry john mccain if they could . '' measurements by the university of navarra indicated that throughout january 2008 , mccain 's global media attention surged from being a distant third among republican candidates to being the equal of romney and huckabee .
new jersey is a state in the mid-atlantic region of the northeastern united states . it is bordered on the north and east by the state of new york ; on the east , southeast , and south by the atlantic ocean ; on the west by the delaware river and pennsylvania ; and on the southwest by delaware bay and the state of delaware . new jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 8,882,190 residents as of 2019 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 u.s. states , with its biggest city being newark . new jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of new york city and philadelphia .
in the general election , barr hoped to portray himself as a conservative alternative to the republican nominee john mccain . he emphasized his opposition to the republican party for its positions on the war in iraq and the usa patriot act , but stood as an advocate for border security and fiscal constraint , demonstrated by his opposition to the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 . the candidate never made headway in election polls , placing third or fourth when included . barr 's efforts to be invited to presidential debates with the two main candidates also fell short when he failed to meet the 15 % polling threshold . the 2008 presidential campaign of bob barr , former congressman of georgia began on may 12 , 2008 . he announced his candidacy for the libertarian party 's presidential after months of grassroots draft efforts . barr -lrb- who had formerly been a republican -rrb- was criticized by libertarians who opposed his efforts in congress , which included a vote in favor of the usa patriot act and authorization of the war in iraq , but he was supported by others who accepted his regret for the votes . barr won the party 's nomination after six rounds of balloting at the 2008 libertarian party national convention . similar to senator bob dole 's 1996 presidential campaign , one of the more widely leveled charges against mccain was the issue of his age -- he turned 72 in august and there was widespread concern about the idea of electing a man who would be 80 years old if he completed two full terms in office -lrb- the oldest president , ronald reagan , had been a month shy of 78 when he left office in january 1989 -rrb- . in addition , mccain suffered from the ill effects of his captivity in north vietnam and reportedly had difficulty lifting his arms above his head . his age in particular was considered a liability against the youthful senator obama , who was the first generation xer to run for president on a major party ticket . mccain for comparison was born before world war ii and belonged to the generation preceding the baby boomers .
however , overlapping dialogue among large groups of actors adds complexity to altman 's films , and they were often criticized as appearing haphazard or disconnected on first viewing . some of his critics , however , changed their mind after seeing them again . british film critic , david thomson , gave nashville -lrb- 1975 -rrb- a bad review after watching it the first time , but later wrote , `` but going back to nashville and some of the earlier films , . . carol burnett remembers altman admitting that many of the ideas in his films came from the actors . `` you never hear a director say that . that was truly an astonishing thing , '' she said . : 328 others , such as jennifer jason leigh , became creatively driven : altman later decided that the song worked so well , he would use it as the film 's main theme , despite mandel 's initial objections . this version was sung by uncredited session singers john bahler , tom bahler , ron hicklin and ian freebairn-smith and the single was attributed to `` the mash '' . during an appearance on the tonight show starring johnny carson in the 1980s , robert altman said that while he only made $ 70,000 for having directed the movie , his son had earned more than $ 1 million for having co-written the song .
in 1938 , shortly after the success of snow white and the seven dwarfs , walt disney became interested in making an animated film based on the tale of peter rabbit . however , in a letter to a friend , potter wrote that she refused walt disney 's `` scheme to film peter rabbit '' , saying , `` i am not very hopeful about the result . they propose to use cartoons ; it seems that a succession of figures can be joggled together to give an impression of motion . i do n't think the pictures would be satisfactory ... conceived as a work of public art , the chronophage reminds viewers in a dramatic way of the inevitable passing of time . taylor deliberately designed it to be `` terrifying '' : `` basically i view time as not on your side . he 'll eat up every minute of your life , and as soon as one has gone he 's salivating for the next . '' it has been described as `` hypnotically beautiful and deeply disturbing '' . usher commented that while he and bieber were both signed at the same age , `` i had the chance to ramp up my success , where this has happened to bieber abruptly '' . as a result , usher , braun , bieber 's bodyguard , and other adults surrounding bieber constantly coach him on handling fame and his public image . after signing bieber , usher appointed one of his former assistants , ryan good , to be bieber 's road manager and stylist . good , once nicknamed bieber 's `` swagger coach '' , created a `` streetwise look '' for the singer which consisted of baseball caps , hoodies , dog chains , and flashy sneakers .
florida -lrb- -lrb- listen -rrb- , spanish pronunciation : -rrb- is the southernmost contiguous state in the united states . the state is bordered to the west by the gulf of mexico , to the northwest by alabama , to the north by georgia , to the east by the atlantic ocean , and to the south by the straits of florida . florida is the 22nd-most extensive -lrb- 65,755 sq mi or 170,300 km2 -rrb- , the 3rd-most populous -lrb- 21,477,737 inhabitants -rrb- , and the 8th-most densely populated -lrb- 384.3 / sq mi or 148.4 / km2 -rrb- of the u.s. states . jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and the largest city by area in the contiguous united states .
in 1980 , six mit students and residents of the burton-conner house at mit taught themselves card-counting . they traveled to atlantic city during the spring break to win their fortune . the group went their separate ways when most of them graduated in may of that year . most never gambled again , but some of them maintained an avid interest in card counting and remained in cambridge , massachusetts . in september 2017 , the school announced the creation of an artificial intelligence research lab called the mit-ibm watson ai lab . ibm will spend $ 240 million over the next decade , and the lab will be staffed by mit and ibm scientists . in october 2018 mit announced that in september 2019 , it would open a new college of computing dedicated to the study of artificial intelligence , to be named after lead donor and the blackstone group ceo stephen schwarzman . the focus of the new college is to study not just ai , but interdisciplinary ai education , and how ai can be used in fields as diverse as history and biology . among much else , the ai lab led to the invention of lisp machines and their attempted commercialization by two companies in the 1980s : symbolics and lisp machines inc. . this divided the ai lab into `` camps '' which resulted in a hiring away of many of the talented programmers . the incident inspired richard stallman 's later work on the gnu project . `` nobody had envisioned that the ai lab 's hacker group would be wiped out , but it was . ''
washington was longing to return home after spending just 10 days at mount vernon out of 8 1⁄2 years of war . he arrived on christmas eve , delighted to be `` free of the bustle of a camp and the busy scenes of public life '' . he was a celebrity and was fêted during a visit to his mother at fredericksburg in february 1784 , and he received a constant stream of visitors wishing to pay their respects to him at mount vernon . after leading the continental army for 8 1/2 years , washington bade farewell to his officers at fraunces tavern in december 1783 , and resigned his commission days later , refuting loyalist predictions that he would not relinquish his military command . in a final appearance in uniform , he gave a statement to the congress : `` i consider it an indispensable duty to close this last solemn act of my official life , by commending the interests of our dearest country to the protection of almighty god , and those who have the superintendence of them , to his holy keeping . '' washington 's resignation was acclaimed at home and abroad and showed a skeptical world that the new republic would not degenerate into chaos . the same month , washington was appointed president-general of the society of the cincinnati , a hereditary fraternity , and he served for the remainder of his life . anthony 's bowling career began when he hesitantly joined his company 's bowling league , west coast grocery , after serving in the united states air force . after his first season bowling , earl achieved his first official league bowling average of 165 . by his third season , his average had surged to 217 . in 1963 , he bowled three pba summer tournaments in the pacific northwest to get a feel for what it would take to successfully compete on the tour .
in 1999 , 10 % of the student body was jewish , a percentage lower than those at other ivy league schools . sixteen percent of the student body was jewish in 1985 ; the number decreased by 40 % from 1985 to 1999 . this decline prompted the daily princetonian to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons . caroline c. pam of the new york observer wrote that princeton was `` long dogged by a reputation for anti-semitism '' and that this history as well as princeton 's elite status caused the university and its community to feel sensitivity towards the decrease of jewish students . in 1981 , the population of african americans at princeton university made up less than 10 % . bruce m. wright was admitted into the university in 1936 as the first african american , however , his admission was a mistake and when he got to campus he was asked to leave . three years later wright asked the dean for an explanation on his dismissal and the dean suggested to him that `` a member of your race might feel very much alone '' at princeton university . americans are split over president barack obama 's latest immigration move , but they 've become less sympathetic to immigrants here illegally over the past year , a new nationwide poll finds . according to the poll , conducted by quinnipiac university and published tuesday , just 45 percent of americans believe obama should issue an executive order to address the immigration issue if congress fails to act , while 48 percent oppose such a move . the number of americans who believe those here illegally should be allowed to stay and given a path to citizenship has dropped since last november , however -- now , only 48 percent believe they should stay , compared to 57 percent who said the same in 2013 . and the number of americans who say illegal immigrants should leave the u.s. is at an all-time high in the new poll .
while clinton 's job approval rating rose during the clinton -- lewinsky scandal and subsequent impeachment , his poll numbers with regard to questions of honesty , integrity and moral character declined . as a result , `` moral character '' and `` honesty '' weighed heavily in the next presidential election . according to the daily princetonian , after the 2000 presidential election , `` post-election polls found that , in the wake of clinton-era scandals , the single most significant reason people voted for bush was for his moral character . '' according to an analysis of the election by stanford university : in april 1994 , genocide broke out in rwanda . intelligence reports indicate that clinton was aware a `` final solution to eliminate all tutsis '' was planned . fearing a reprisal of the events in somalia the previous year , clinton chose not to intervene . president clinton has referred to the failure of the u.s. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings , saying `` i do n't think we could have ended the violence , but i think we could have cut it down . enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of bill clinton 's presidency . when the first two bills on the issue came from a republican-controlled congress lacking protections for people coming off welfare , however , hillary urged him to veto the bills , which he did . a third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas ; critics , including her past mentor edelman , urged her to get the president to veto it again . but she decided to support the bill , which became the welfare reform act of 1996 , as the best political compromise available .
mawlawi akhundzada was later appointed as chief justice of the shariah courts of the islamic emirate of afghanistan . rather than a warlord or military commander , he has a reputation as a religious leader who was responsible for issuing most of the taliban 's fatwas and settling religious issues among members of the taliban . both mullah omar and mullah mansour are known to have consulted akhundzada on matters of fatwa . unlike his predecessors who were educated in pakistan -- and who were also believed to have moved permanently east across the durand line after the u.s. invasion in 2001 and during the resulting war -- akhundzada is believed to have lived in afghanistan throughout the 2001 -- 2016 period with no travel record , though he has close ties with the quetta-based taliban shura . in early september , afghan media sources had announced that dadullah was said to have joined the afghanistan branch of the islamic state group , following disputes over the appointment of akhtar mansour as leader of the taliban . the announcement came from an islamic state supporter in afghanistan who further stated that 230 is fighters were deployed to zabul province from farah province to aid dadullah 's forces against 2,100 taliban militants sent by mansour . according to the district governor of arghandab in zabul province , haji momand nasratyar , dadullah 's fighters are sympathetic to the islamic state . however , other afghan sources state that dadullah denied joining the islamic state in afghanistan and was still loyal to the taliban . after his brother was killed on may 12 , 2007 , a taliban spokesman announced that mansoor dadullah would be taking his place as military commander of the taliban insurgency in southern afghanistan . his appointment is not thought to be the result of any particular ability , but was simply due to the fact he was dadullah 's brother . taliban leader mullah omar , who had resented dadullah 's brutality , was said to have opposed mansoor dadullah 's appointment . he did , however , receive support from al-qaeda , who wished him to employ the tactics of abu musab al-zarqawi in afghanistan .
the final campaign for richmond , virginia , the capital of the confederate states , began when the union army of the potomac crossed the james river in june 1864 . the armies under the command of lieutenant general and general in chief ulysses s. grant -lrb- 1822 -- 1885 -rrb- laid siege to petersburg , south of richmond , intending to cut the two cities ' supply lines and force the confederates to evacuate . in the spring of 1865 , confederate states army gen. robert e. lee -lrb- 1807 -- 1870 -rrb- , waited for an opportunity to leave the petersburg lines , aware that the position was untenable , but union troops made the first move . on april 1 , 1865 , maj. gen. philip sheridan 's cavalry turned lee 's flank at the battle of five forks . arlington house , the robert e. lee memorial , also known as the custis -- lee mansion , is a greek revival mansion in arlington , virginia , that was once lee 's home . it overlooks the potomac river and the national mall in washington , d.c. . during the civil war , the grounds of the mansion were selected as the site of arlington national cemetery , in part to ensure that lee would never again be able to return to his home . the united states designated the mansion as a national memorial to lee in 1955 , a mark of widespread respect for him in both the north and south . the battle of appomattox court house , fought in appomattox county , virginia , on the morning of april 9 , 1865 , was one of the last battles of the american civil war -lrb- 1861 -- 1865 -rrb- . it was the final engagement of confederate general in chief , robert e. lee , and his army of northern virginia before it surrendered to the union army of the potomac under the commanding general of the united states , ulysses s. grant .
the completed chrysler building garnered mixed reviews in the press . van alen was hailed as the `` doctor of altitude '' by architect magazine , while architect kenneth murchison called van alen the `` ziegfeld of his profession '' , comparing him to popular broadway producer florenz ziegfeld jr. . the building was praised for being `` an expression of the intense activity and vibrant life of our day '' , and for `` teem with the spirit of modernism , ... the epitome of modern business life , stand for progress in architecture and in modern building methods .

during a 1993 visit to kuwait , bush was targeted in an assassination plot directed by the iraqi intelligence service . president clinton retaliated when he ordered the firing of 23 cruise missiles at iraqi intelligence service headquarters in baghdad . bush did not publicly comment on the assassination attempt or the missile strike , but privately spoke with clinton shortly before the strike took place . in the 1994 gubernatorial elections , his sons george w. and jeb concurrently ran for governor of texas and governor of florida . following the white nationalist unite the right rally in charlottesville , virginia , bush and his father released a joint statement condemning the violence and ideologies present at the rally ; `` america must always reject racial bigotry , anti-semitism , and hatred in all forms . as we pray for charlottesville , we are all reminded of the fundamental truths recorded by that city 's most prominent citizen in the declaration of independence : we are all created equal and endowed by our creator with unalienable rights . we know these truths to be everlasting because we have seen the decency and greatness of our country . '' their statement came as president trump was facing controversy over his statements about the rally . in april 2009 , along with stars sarah chalke , jason lewis , alicia silverstone , jane lynch , and lance bass , bush appeared in the funny or die video `` a gaythering storm '' , which parodied a national organization for marriage video objecting to same-sex marriage . bush is a staunch supporter of gay rights and , in may 2009 , she showed up at a rally in protest of proposition 8 . she carried a sign stating , `` i do support the freedom to marry '' , and a shirt which had the words `` legalize gay '' across it . in an interview in january 2012 , bush said about the 2012 republican candidates : `` i will not vote for a candidate who thinks you can ` pray away the gay , ' i will not vote for a candidate who thinks that he has more rights to my uterus than i do , i will not vote for a candidate who thinks that it 's okay to dump toxic waste in the ocean .
presidents use oval office addresses as a way to directly communicate with the american people . it is considered to be a major address and it functions as a way to move public opinion by having a direct connection with the president of the united states . presidential historian , robert dallek stated , `` the oval office invokes the center of the presidential authority . that 's the president 's office , that 's where he supposedly makes decisions , where he governs . '' the tone of the speech is set when presidents decide to make a speech in the oval office . meanwhile , while not officially confirming interest in the vice presidential slot , clinton hinted at the possibility earlier on june 3 . when asked for clarification , her campaign released the statement `` today on a conference call with new york legislators , sen. clinton was asked whether she was open to the idea of running as vice president and repeated what she has said before : she would do whatever she could to ensure that democrats take the white house back and defeat john mccain . '' the vice presidential possibility had been raised by bill clinton in the previous month , but this fueled speculation that hillary clinton was definitively interested in the possibility . the lead up to hillary clinton 's speech to a democratic women 's group in washington on tuesday night was focused on two things : the controversy around her exclusive use of personal emails at the state department and questions around her family foundation 's fundraising practices . her speech , however , was not . clinton failed to mention any aspect of the two stories that dominated all coverage of clinton over the past week , instead using her speech to 1,600 mostly women democratic activists to focus on her vision of the future , the importance of electing women to office and her all-but-announced presidential plans . read : 4 reasons to care about clinton 's email `` do n't you someday want to see a woman president of the untied states ?

the oscars can be unpredictable , but one thing is for certain : each year there will be at least one glaring oversight in the `` in memoriam '' montage . at the 85th academy awards on sunday night , andy griffith and larry hagman were among the stars left out of the show 's annual tribute to the hollywood folks who passed away in the last year . with limited time during the 3 1/2 - hour telecast to commemorate everyone , the academy published a gallery online honoring more than 100 late stars , some of whom were n't included in the reel on the telecast . griffith and hagman both appear in the 114-slide photo gallery . one of the most surprising moments of this year 's oscars came at the very end , when first lady michelle obama showed up on video to help announce the best picture winner . if you 're anything like us , you immediately wondered what the significance could be , especially since she was announcing the award from the white house . but when you think about it , having obama help draw the oscars ceremony to a close was a fitting way to end this politically saturated awards season . the real-life drama of d.c. politics can be absorbing enough on its own , but mix in hollywood machinations and you could create a must-see movie . the 90th academy awards in 2018 had the lowest nielsen ratings of all time , with less than half of the 57.25 million viewers of the 70th in 1998 . in october 2018 , the academy asked dwayne johnson to host the 91st ceremony , believing that the popularity of hollywood 's highest-paid actor would help increase the audience . johnson immediately began planning what he described as an `` audience first '' show , but could not change his schedule of filming hobbs & shaw and jumanji : the next level .

'' after enlightenment which included the hit singles `` real real gone '' and the title cut in 1990 , an ambitious double album `` hymns to the silence '' was released the following year , his only double studio album . at the 2018 ceremony , a new induction category for singles was announced by steven van zandt . according to van zandt , the category is `` a recognition of the excellence of the singles that shaped rock 'n' roll , kind of a rock 'n' roll jukebox , records by artists not in the rock hall -- which is not to say these artists will never be in the rock hall . they just are not in the rock hall at the moment . '' however , the isley brothers , whose song `` twist and shout '' was inducted in 2019 , were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame as performers in 1992 . the hall of fame inductions began in 1993 with the rock and roll hall of fame . morrison was the first living inductee not to attend his own ceremony , -- robbie robertson from the band accepted the award on his behalf . when morrison became the initial musician inducted into the irish music hall of fame , bob geldof presented morrison with the award . morrison 's third induction was into the songwriters hall of fame for `` recognition of his unique position as one of the most important songwriters of the past century '' .

three former cia directors -- george tenet , porter goss and michael v. hayden -- as well as three former cia deputy directors , wrote an op-ed in the wall street journal in response to the release of the senate intelligence committee report . they criticized the report as `` a partisan attack on the agency that has done the most to protect america after the 9/11 attacks . '' they said that the cia 's interrogation program was invaluable to the capture of al qaeda operatives and the disruption of al qaeda 's efforts and also stated that , contrary to the senate intelligence committee 's findings , `` there is no doubt that information provided by the totality of detainees in cia custody was essential to bringing bin laden to justice . '' additionally , they wrote that the cia remained within the interrogation techniques authorized by the doj ; that the cia did not mislead the doj , white house or congress ; and that the threat of a '' ` ticking time bomb ' scenario '' context was critical to understanding the program . cia director john o. brennan agreed with the current administration 's policy prohibiting enhanced interrogation techniques and admitted that the program had had `` shortcomings . '' he disagreed with the committee 's conclusion that information obtained through torture could have been obtained by other means , and said it is unknowable whether other interrogation approaches would have yielded the same information . in supporting his views , brennan also released a 136-page declassified version of an official cia response and critique of the torture report written in june 2013 . however , the cia also released a document in december 2014 titled `` note to readers of the central intelligence agency 's response to the senate select committee on intelligence 's study of the cia 's detention and interrogation program , '' in which the cia admitted that many of its objections were incorrect , including that the state department may not actually have been aware of cia black sites in some countries , that cia personnel had in fact used enhanced interrogation techniques without prior approval , and that some of the information the cia claimed came from these techniques had not . on december 17 , 2013 , sen. mark udall -lrb- d-co -rrb- revealed the existence of a secret internal review -lrb- the `` panetta review '' -rrb- conducted by the cia that was consistent with the senate 's report but conflicted with the cia 's official response to the report . in january 2014 , cia officials claimed that the intelligence committee had accessed portions of the `` panetta review '' and removed them from cia facilities in 2010 without cia authorization . in march 2014 , sen. dianne feinstein -lrb- d-ca -rrb- , chairwoman of the intelligence committee , confirmed that a portion of the `` panetta review '' had been copied and transferred to a safe in the senate 's hart office building . she stated that the action was necessary to protect the documents from the cia , which had destroyed videotapes depicting brutal interrogation methods in 2005 .
states that have legalized marijuana for managing chronic pain have significantly fewer deaths from prescription painkiller overdoses each year , according to a new study published monday in jama internal medicine . researchers looked at medical marijuana laws and death certificate data in all 50 states between 1999 and 2010 . during that time , just 13 states had medical marijuana laws in place . `` we found there was about a 25 % lower rate of prescription painkiller overdose deaths on average after implementation of a medical marijuana law , '' lead study author dr. marcus bachhuber said . john rudolph niernsee , one of the most famous architects of the time , designed the orphan asylum and helped to design the johns hopkins hospital . the original site for the johns hopkins university had been chosen personally by hopkins . according to his will , it was to be located at his summer estate , clifton . however , a decision was made not to found the university there . most importantly , hopkins told the trustees to `` bear constantly in mind that it is my wish and purpose that the hospital shall ultimately form a part of the medical school of that university for which i have made ample provision in my will . '' by calling for this integral relationship between patient care , as embodied in the hospital , and teaching and research , as embodied in the university , hopkins laid the groundwork for a revolution in american medicine . johns hopkins ' vision , of two institutions in which the practice of medicine would be wedded to medical research and medical education was nothing short of revolutionary .
after centuries buried beneath the vatican , and decades hidden away inside the holy see , the bones of a man long believed to be st. peter , one of the founding fathers of the christian church , are on display for the first time . the controversial remains were revealed to the public on sunday at a mass in st peter 's square marking the conclusion of the catholic church 's `` year of faith . '' writing in l'osservatore romano , the semi-official vatican newspaper , archbishop rino fisichella said the `` relics which tradition recognizes as those of the apostle who gave his life for the lord '' would be exhibited as part of the service . l'osservatore romano reports that 8.5 million pilgrims have venerated the relics over the course of the year . thanksgiving day is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in the united states , canada , some of the caribbean islands , and liberia . it began as a day of giving thanks and sacrifice for the blessing of the harvest and of the preceding year . similarly named festival holidays occur in germany and japan . thanksgiving is celebrated on the second monday of october in canada and on the fourth thursday of november in the united states and brazil , and around the same part of the year in other places . in may 2013 , pope francis met with pope tawadros ii of alexandria in the vatican . the meeting coincided with the 40th anniversary of the first visit by a pope of the coptic orthodox church of alexandria to the vatican ; when pope shenouda iii of alexandria met with pope paul vi on 10 may 1973 . francis reflected on the close relationship between the catholic church and the coptic orthodox church of alexandria , saying that the visit `` strengthens the bonds of friendship and brotherhood that already exist between the see of peter and the see of mark '' and praised the commission for theological dialogue for preparing ground for dialogue between the catholic church and oriental orthodox churches . pope francis also acknowledged the two churches shared beliefs in the trinity , the divinity of christ , marian devotion , apostolic traditions , and the seven sacraments .
stanley kubrick met with him to discuss the possibility of martin starring in a screwball comedy version of traumnovelle -lrb- kubrick later changed his approach to the material , the result of which was 1999 's eyes wide shut -rrb- . martin was executive producer for domestic life , a prime-time television series starring friend martin mull , and a late-night series called twilight theater . it emboldened martin to try his hand at his first serious film , pennies from heaven -lrb- 1981 -rrb- , based on the 1978 bbc serial by dennis potter . he was anxious to perform in the movie because of his desire to avoid being typecast . martin has had tinnitus since filming a pistol-shooting scene for the film three amigos in 1986 . he has been quoted as saying `` you just get used to it , or you go insane . '' in a 2010 interview on the green room with paul provenza , mull identifies himself as an agnostic , saying `` i certainly do n't begrudge someone else their choice to follow whatever they do , it 's just for me , it does n't make a lot of sense . i think more harm has come to this planet through organized religion , probably , than any single situation that we 've invented . ''
it 's all a question of what we do with the next six months . the whole reason for aiding england is to give us time ... as long as she is in there , we have time to prepare . it is n't that fighting for democracy . that 's the bunk . on june 13 , 1938 , kennedy met in london with herbert von dirksen , the german ambassador to the united kingdom , who claimed upon his return to berlin that kennedy had told him that `` it was not so much the fact that we want to get rid of the jews that was so harmful to us , but rather the loud clamor with which we accompanied this purpose . himself fully understood our jewish policy . '' kennedy 's main concern with such violent acts against german jews as kristallnacht was that they generated bad publicity in the west for the nazi regime , a concern that he communicated in a letter to charles lindbergh . kennedy was considered the front runner for the governorship of massachusetts in 1998 , but revelations about his personal life led to a tumultuous fall in public opinion polling , and he decided against running . kennedy explained in a vfw hall in a working-class corner of boston that he believed he would never be able to focus his candidacy on issues : `` the race will focus on personal or family questions . it is not fair to my family , it is not fair to the people of massachusetts and it is not the right thing to do . ''
engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large . engineers typically include a factor of safety in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure . the need for systems engineering arose with the increase in complexity of systems and projects , in turn exponentially increasing the possibility of component friction , and therefore the unreliability of the design . when speaking in this context , complexity incorporates not only engineering systems , but also the logical human organization of data . at the same time , a system can become more complex due to an increase in size as well as with an increase in the amount of data , variables , or the number of fields that are involved in the design . the international space station is an example of such a system . usually , multiple reasonable solutions exist , so engineers must evaluate the different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements . genrich altshuller , after gathering statistics on a large number of patents , suggested that compromises are at the heart of `` low-level '' engineering designs , while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem .
president barack obama went beyond criticizing foreign powers at the united nations on monday to take veiled shots at republican presidential candidates , including donald trump , though he did n't mention any by name . the president slammed the notion of `` building of walls to keep out immigrants , '' which several gop candidates , including trump , have espoused and generally the `` politics of us versus them . '' obama 's comments marked a rare moment when a president used an address to the global body as a venue for singling out domestic political opponents . obama , however , did n't limit his attacks to republicans , noting that some on the other side of the aisle have made similar objections . president barack obama got much closer monday to locking in a major part of his legacy : the biggest regional free trade deal in history . but first he has to win the political battle in congress and on the 2016 presidential campaign trail . trade negotiators ' announcement that they 've reached a deal on the 12-country trans-pacific partnership starts the clock on a politically fraught process that will drop the deal into a combustible congress , where populists in both parties oppose it , in the midst of a presidential campaign . and 2016 candidates will weigh in -- some with the potential to fan the flames of discontent on capitol hill and with both parties ' most loyal voters . president barack obama will visit roseburg , oregon , friday following the mass shooting at an oregon community college last week that killed 10 people , including the shooter , according to a white house official . `` on friday , october 9 , the president will travel to roseburg , oregon , to visit privately with families of victims of the shooting . further details about the president 's travel to oregon will be made available in the coming days , '' the official told cnn . on the day of the shootings , obama made impassioned remarks , once again renewing his call for tougher gun legislation .
apple lost the trademark battle to solid group in a 2015 decision made by ipo director nathaniel arevalo , who also reportedly said that it was unlikely that consumers would be confused between the `` iphone '' and the `` myphone '' . `` this is a case of a giant trying to claim more territory than what it is entitled to , to the great prejudice of a local ` pinoy phone ' merchant who has managed to obtain a significant foothold in the mobile phone market through the marketing and sale of innovative products under a very distinctive trademark '' , arevalo later added . the iphone allows audio conferencing , call holding , call merging , caller id , and integration with other cellular network features and iphone functions . for example , if music is playing when a call is received , the music fades out , and fades back in when the call has ended . in mid-august , uniquephones announced an unlocking service for iphone , only to retract the service the following week after receiving a phone call from a lawyer representing at&t . on august 24 , 2007 , george hotz , a 17-year-old hacker from glen rock , new jersey , broke the lock that ties iphone to at&t 's wireless network . he confirmed that he unlocked the phone and was using it on t-mobile 's network . the hack opened up a realm of possibilities for overseas customers because iphone was only sold in the united states at the time .
sprint corporation is an american telecommunications company that provides wireless services and is an internet service provider , based in overland park , kansas . it is the fourth-largest mobile network operator in the united states and serves 54.3 million customers as of june 30th 2019 . the company also offers wireless voice , messaging , and broadband services through its various subsidiaries under the assurance wireless , boost mobile , and virgin mobile brands , and wholesale access to its wireless networks to mobile virtual network operators . in july 2013 , a majority of the company was purchased by the japanese telecommunications company softbank group corp. , although the remaining shares of the company continue to trade on the new york stock exchange . maintaining two active radios in a single handset is a power-intensive task , and some users have complained about lack of battery endurance in the ic402/ic502 models . some users report sprint-nextel acknowledges the problem and has even offered free car chargers as a result . additionally , because motorola did not include the capability for 800 mhz roaming in the handset , the usable coverage area for a powersource phone is significantly less than that of a comparable sprint pcs phone . also , since the powersource series does not allow voice calling over the iden network , a customer with good nextel coverage but no sprint coverage would only be able to use the walkie-talkie feature . the following is a list of bacon dishes . the word bacon is derived from the old high german bacho , meaning `` buttock '' , `` ham '' , or `` side of bacon '' , and cognate with the old french bacon . bacon is made from the sides , belly , or back of the pig and contains varying amounts of fat depending on the cut . it is cured and smoked over wood cut from apple trees , mesquite trees , or hickory trees .
on april 8 , 2013 , johnson was fired from j. c. penney after 17 months with the company . mike ullman , the retailer 's former ceo , was announced as his replacement shortly afterwards -- the official statement claimed that ullman was `` well-positioned to quickly analyze the situation j. c. penney faces and take steps to improve the company 's performance . '' during his time at home depot , ellison helped oversee the chain 's turnaround . as ceo of j.c. penney , ellison helped the company make progress in recovering lost profitability and laid out a three-year plan , starting in 2017 , for growing sales . but he admitted that he had failed to increase the value of the company 's stock for its stockholders , which by his own statement is the primary responsibility of a ceo . on september 26 , 2013 , j. c. penney , with goldman sachs as the sole underwriter , announced plans to issue 84 million shares of its stock . the move stood in contrast with ceo mike ullman 's remarks from earlier that day , whereby he did not foresee `` conditions for the rest of the year that would warrant raising liquidity .

the puzzling disappearance of a malaysian jetliner last year is not the first time a plane has vanished without a trace . as investigators analyze new debris from an indian ocean island to determine whether it 's wreckage from the missing mh370 , here are nine cases of plane disappearances and disasters , some of which remain unsolved decades later . 2014 : malaysia airlines flight 370 the boeing 777 passenger jet vanished in march last year -- about an hour into its flight from the malaysian capital of kuala lumpur to beijing . there was no distress call before it lost contact over the sea between malaysia and vietnam . malaysia airlines flight 370 made drastic changes in altitude and direction after disappearing from civilian radar , u.s. officials told cnn on friday , raising questions for investigators about just who was at the controls of the commercial jetliner that went missing one week ago with 239 people on board . the more the united states learns about the flight 's pattern , `` the more difficult to write off '' the idea that some type of human intervention was involved , one of the officials familiar with the investigation said . the revelation comes as cnn has learned that a classified analysis of electronic and satellite data suggests the flight likely crashed either in the bay of bengal or elsewhere in the indian ocean . the analysis conducted by the united states and malaysian governments may have narrowed the search area for the jetliner that vanished en route from kuala lumpur to beijing , leaving little trace of where it went or why . as mystery surrounds the disappearance of malaysia airlines flight mh 370 , which was en route from kuala lumpur to beijing early saturday , cnn 's aviation expert richard quest said the airliner would have been at the safest point in the flight . `` it was two hours into the flight -- this would have been classed as the ` cruise portion of the flight , ' '' he said . `` you break down the flight into taxi , take-off , climb out and then cruise . `` so in that particular point of the flight , this is the safest part , nothing is supposed to go wrong .

saddam hussein and al-qaeda link allegations were made by the u.s. government officials who claimed that a highly secretive relationship existed between iraqi president saddam hussein and the radical islamist militant organization al-qaeda between 1992 and 2003 , specifically through a series of meetings reportedly involving the iraqi intelligence service -lrb- iis -rrb- . in the lead up to the iraq war , u.s. president george w. bush alleged that saddam hussein and al-qaeda might conspire to launch terrorist attacks on the united states , basing the administration 's rationale for war , in part , on this allegation and others . the consensus of intelligence experts has been that these contacts never led to an operational relationship , and that consensus is backed up by reports from the independent 9/11 commission and by declassified defense department reports as well as by the senate select committee on intelligence , whose 2006 report of phase ii of its investigation into prewar intelligence reports concluded that there was no evidence of ties between saddam hussein and al-qaeda . critics of the bush administration have said bush was intentionally building a case for war with iraq without regard to factual evidence . many members of the international community , especially the u.s. , continued to view saddam as a bellicose tyrant who was a threat to the stability of the region . in his january 2002 state of the union address to congress , president george w. bush spoke of an `` axis of evil '' consisting of iran , north korea , and iraq . moreover , bush announced that he would possibly take action to topple the iraqi government , because of the threat of its weapons of mass destruction . bush stated that `` the iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax , and nerve gas , and nuclear weapons for over a decade ... iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward america and to support terror .

like the english and irish country houses it was modeled on , the white house was , from the start , open to the public until the early part of the 20th century . president thomas jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805 , and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the capitol followed him home , where he greeted them in the blue room . those open houses sometimes became rowdy : in 1829 , president andrew jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the white house . his aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey . later that afternoon , pelosi held a rare public `` engrossment ceremony '' , followed by a stately procession of the managers and other house officers across the capitol building where the third impeachment of a us president was announced to the senate . with the exception of the managers , who will conduct the trial , the house 's involvement in the impeachment process came to an end . twenty-one people who worked for the trump organization while undocumented have asked to meet with president donald trump to address immigration policy reform and request deportation relief , the washington post reported . the post on wednesday obtained a letter from former trump organization golf course groundskeepers , maids and kitchen staff -- some who worked there for 10 years -- asking the president to `` do the right thing to find a home for us here in america so that we can step out of the shadows and not deport us and our friends and family . '' `` we are modest people who represent the dreams of the 11 million undocumented men , women and children who live and work in this country , '' the group wrote in the letter shared by the post . `` we love america and want to talk to you about helping to give us a chance to become legal .

for months , facebook and twitter investors shrugged off concerns about election meddling , regulatory scrutiny and an industry-wide privacy awakening . all that mattered was the two platforms kept getting more people to scroll past ads , thereby making more money . facebook 's stock soared to all-time highs despite the onslaught of bad press that followed the cambridge analytica data scandal . and twitter nearly doubled in value this year on enthusiasm for its business turnaround . facebook ceo mark zuckerberg tried to clarify his controversial comments about holocaust deniers wednesday afternoon , hours after he was quoted saying some deniers who post on facebook are n't `` intentionally getting it wrong . '' zuckerberg made his comments during an interview that recode 's kara swisher published wednesday morning . he cited holocaust denials as an example of controversial misinformation that facebook would allow to remain on the platform . facebook has said that it allows conspiracy theories to remain on the site , but limits their reach so fewer people see them . facebook has been criticized for not doing enough to limit the spread of fake news stories on their site , especially after the 2016 united states presidential election , which some have claimed donald trump would not have won if facebook had not helped spread what they claim to have been fake stories that were biased in his favor . mark zuckerberg has begun to take steps to eliminate the prevalence of fake news on facebook as a result criticisms of facebook 's influence on the presidential election . at a conference called techonomy mark zuckerberg stated in regards to donald trump , `` there 's a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way that they did is because they saw some fake news '' . zuckerberg affirms the idea that people do not stray from their own ideals and political leanings .
the human life protection act , also known as house bill 314 -lrb- hb 314 -rrb- and the alabama abortion ban , is an alabama statute enacted on may 15 , 2019 , that was set to impose a near-total ban on abortion in the state starting in november 2019 , but a legal challenge against the bill has delayed implementation . the bill was passed in both chambers of the alabama legislature in a party-line vote and signed by republican governor kay ivey . under the human life protection act , a doctor who performs a banned abortion in the state of alabama would be guilty of a class a felony , and could be sentenced to life imprisonment . several proposed amendments that would have allowed abortions in cases of rape and incest were rejected . false reports of republican strength in alabama abounded . the new york times predicted that martin `` not only has a chance to win the governorship , but at least for the moment must be rated as the favorite . '' political writer theodore h. white incorrectly predicted that alabama , instead of arkansas and florida as it developed , would in 1966 become the first former confederate state to elect a republican governor . briefly , a consensus developed that martin might even lend coattails to republican candidates in legislative , county , and municipal elections though there was no gop nominee for lieutenant governor . on april 6 , 2018 , ivey signed a bill exempting economic development professionals from registering as lobbyists under the alabama ethics law . the bill was sponsored by ken johnson and would have died if not signed by ivey over the weekend . ivey said the legislation would allow the state `` to remain on a level playing field with other states , as we compete for job creating capital investments '' and alabama 's ability to attract highly sought-after economic development projects would allow the state to continue experiencing `` record-low unemployment '' . on april 9 ivey signed a bill extending the reach of the simplified sellers use tax to capture purchases from third-party vendors selling products through amazon and other online marketplaces .
after touring for nearly two years , the wallflowers took a short break before returning to the studio to record their third album , -lrb- breach -rrb- . dylan approached the songwriting process differently this time than he had for the wallflowers ' two previous albums , explaining that he did n't want to avoid the subject of his personal life , as he had done in the past : '' -lrb- breach -rrb- was the first record that i realized that it 's necessary and i have a right to write about anything that i want to write about . i 'm not going to dance around these subjects anymore ... i do n't have any interest in writing songs that are defensive or that address anything that do n't come naturally to me but i also realized that i needed to stop this nonsense of pretending that hiding any of this information counts to anybody ; it just does n't really matter anymore . '' by the time sessions were held for his debut album , dylan was absorbing an enormous amount of folk material from sitting and listening to contemporaries performing in new york 's clubs and coffeehouses . many of these individuals were also close friends who performed with dylan , often inviting him to their apartments where they would introduce him to more folk songs . at the same time , dylan was borrowing and listening to a large number of folk , blues , and country records , many of which were hard to find at the time . dylan claimed in the documentary no direction home that he needed to hear a song only once or twice to learn it . a lot of times when you write songs , you 're aware that this line is just going to help you get to the next line and someone 's probably going to do an organ fill right there anyway -- you can let those go . but with something like this , it was just three instruments , really ; vocals being one of the instruments , which then makes the lyrics being one of the instruments . you 're more aware that things are going to be more exposed and you ca n't really let anything go unless you 're confident that this is what you want to say .

with his gang nearly annihilated , james trusted only the ford brothers , charley and robert . although charley had been out on raids with james , bob ford was an eager new recruit . for protection , james asked the ford brothers to move in with him and his family . james had often stayed with their sister martha bolton and , according to rumor , he was `` smitten '' with her . james 's younger daughter anne succeeded when william died in 1702 . the act of settlement provided that , if the line of succession established in the bill of rights were extinguished , the crown would go to a german cousin , sophia , electress of hanover , and to her protestant heirs . sophia was a granddaughter of james vi and i through his eldest daughter , elizabeth stuart , the sister of charles i. thus , when anne died in 1714 -lrb- less than two months after the death of sophia -rrb- , she was succeeded by george i , sophia 's son , the elector of hanover and anne 's second cousin . a north georgia man is charged with murder after authorities say he put vodka in his 4-month-old 's baby bottle , leading to her death -- an incident that his public defender says was an accident . the infant girl died june 8 , 2011 , after she drank the vodka . just over a year later , a dekalb county grand jury indicted her father , keith antonine furlow , on felony murder and second-degree cruelty to children , according to the court document filed thursday . `` we 're at a point where we are just pursuing justice for this infant little girl , '' district attorney robert james told hln 's nancy grace on friday .
nathaniel hawthorne was born on july 4 , 1804 , in salem , massachusetts ; his birthplace is preserved and open to the public . william hathorne was the author 's great-great-great-grandfather . he was a puritan and was the first of the family to emigrate from england , settling in dorchester , massachusetts , before moving to salem . there he became an important member of the massachusetts bay colony and held many political positions , including magistrate and judge , becoming infamous for his harsh sentencing . the hawthornes had three children . their first was daughter una , born march 3 , 1844 ; her name was a reference to the faerie queene , to the displeasure of family members . hawthorne wrote to a friend , `` i find it a very sober and serious kind of happiness that springs from the birth of a child ... there is no escaping it any longer . in `` hawthorne and his mosses '' , herman melville wrote a passionate argument for hawthorne to be among the burgeoning american literary canon , `` he is one of the new , and far better generation of your writers . '' in this review of mosses from an old manse , melville describes an affinity for hawthorne that would only increase : `` i feel that this hawthorne has dropped germinous seeds into my soul . he expands and deepens down , the more i contemplate him ; and further , and further , shoots his strong new-england roots into the hot soil of my southern soul .

in 1843 , the name of the college was changed to delaware college . the university of delaware traces its origins to 1743 , when presbyterian minister francis alison opened a `` free school '' in his home in new london , pennsylvania . during its early years , the school was run under the auspices of the philadelphia synod of the presbyterian church . the school changed its name and location several times . it moved to newark by 1765 and received a charter from the colonial penn government as the academy of newark in 1769 . the delaware college for colored students was established on may 15 , 1891 , by the delaware general assembly . the name was changed to the state college for colored students by state legislative action in 1893 to eliminate confusion with delaware college , which was attended by whites in newark , del. . it first awarded degrees in 1898 . in 1945 , the middle states commission on higher education awarded the college provisional accreditation .

tens of thousands of women worldwide have taken legal action against johnson & johnson after suffering serious complications following a vaginal mesh implant procedure . in 2016 the u.s. states of california and washington filed a lawsuit against the company , accusing it of deception . more than 700 women began a class action against the company in the federal court of australia in 2017 , telling the court they `` suffered irreparable , debilitating pain after the devices began to erode into surrounding tissue and organs , causing infections and complications '' . the class action alleged that johnson & johnson , which `` aggressively marketed '' the implants `` failed to properly warn patients and surgeons of the risk , or test the devices adequately '' . after the murder of civil rights worker viola liuzzo , johnson went on television to announce the arrest of four ku klux klansmen implicated in her death . he angrily denounced the klan as a `` hooded society of bigots , '' and warned them to `` return to a decent society before it 's too late .

there have been different interpretations regarding title ix 's application to high school athletics . the american sports council sued the department of education in 2011 seeking a declaratory judgment that its policy interpreting title ix 's requirement for equity in participation opportunities is limited to colleges and universities . the american sports council argued that `` the three-part test and its encouragement of quotas , has no relevance to high schools or high-school sports , and no federal regulation or interpretation has ever said that high schools must abide by the three-part test '' . on the other hand , the department of education insists that title ix is a `` valuable tool '' for ensuring a level playing field for all students '' and `` plays a critical role in ensuring a fundamental level of fairness in america 's schools and universities '' . however , according to a 2004 survey , a majority of the 1001 parent groups polled wants complete sex education in the schools . the american people are heavily divided over the issue . over 80 % of polled parents agreed with the statement `` sex education in school makes it easier for me to talk to my child about sexual issues , '' while under 17 % agreed with the statement that their children were being exposed to `` subjects i do n't think my child should be discussing .

oprah winfrey gave weight watchers a boost . now 's she bringing her health kick to supermarket aisles . winfrey and kraft heinz company on wednesday unveiled a line of refrigerated comfort food called o , that 's good ! the dishes -- four soups and four sides -- are the first products to come out of the partnership , which was revealed earlier this year . the `` upside-down '' squeezable plastic bottle , consisting of an opaque red bottle with a wide white cap located at the bottom , was introduced as a food service product in 2002 . it allows ketchup to be dispensed more easily than was possible with the glass bottle , and permits the use of more of the ketchup in the bottle , as the contents will settle on top of the dispensing valve . the `` upside-down '' bottle is intended to be non-refillable . a similar bottle has been introduced in several different sizes at the retail/grocery level , but without the opaque red coloring . as ketchup has high viscosity and behaves as a pseudoplastic or thixotropic liquid , dispensing from glass bottles can be difficult . tapping the glass bottle causes the ketchup to become thinner and easier to pour . heinz suggests , on its website , that the best place to tap the bottle is on the `` 57 '' mark . the new york times has also claimed that the tapping the `` 57 '' mark is the best way to cause heinz ketchup to pour smoothly .
darwin became a keen student of robert edmond grant , a lamarckian anatomist . grant had cited erasmus darwin in his doctoral thesis and shared the evolutionist ideas of étienne geoffroy saint-hilaire on evolution by acquired characteristics . charles joined grant in pioneering investigations of the life cycle of marine invertebrates on the shores of the firth of forth . darwin and grant collected tiny animals from the rock pools and walked along the rocky shore at prestonpans , where grant lived during the winter at walford house . after doing particularly well in his final exam questions on paleys ' books , darwin read paley 's natural theology which set out to refute david hume 's argument that the teleological argument for `` design '' by a creator was merely a human projection onto the forces of nature . paley saw a rational proof of god 's existence in the complexity and perfect adaptation to needs of living beings exquisitely fitted to their places in a happy world , while attacking the evolutionary ideas of erasmus darwin as coinciding with atheistic schemes and lacking evidence . paley 's benevolent god acted in nature through uniform and universal laws , not arbitrary miracles or changes of laws , and this use of secondary laws provided a theodicy explaining the problem of evil by separating nature from direct divine action , drawing directly on the ideas of thomas malthus . for paley , a malthusian `` system of natural hostilities '' of animals living on prey was strictly connected to the surplus of births keeping the world appropriately stocked as circumstances changed , and poverty showed that the world was in a `` state of probation ... calculated for the production , exercise , and improvement of moral qualities , with a view to a future state '' , even where such divine purpose was not obvious . darwin continued to avoid public controversy and to accumulate evidence supporting his theory against the anticipated arguments . in 1858 the information that alfred russel wallace now had a similar theory forced an early joint publication of darwin 's theory . the reaction to darwin 's theory , even after publication of on the origin of species in 1859 , was more muted than he had feared . one of the first responses to review copies came from charles kingsley , a christian socialist country rector and novelist , who wrote that it was `` just as noble a conception of deity , to believe that he created primal forms capable of self development ... as to believe that he required a fresh act of intervention to supply the lacunas which he himself had made .

taube 's second marriage was arranged by her family and , as goldman puts it , `` mismated from the first '' . her second husband , abraham goldman , invested taube 's inheritance in a business that quickly failed . the ensuing hardship , combined with the emotional distance of husband and wife , made the household a tense place for the children . when taube became pregnant , abraham hoped desperately for a son ; a daughter , he believed , would be one more sign of failure . jane fairfax is an orphan whose only family consists of her aunt , miss bates , and her grandmother , mrs. bates . she is a beautiful , bright , and elegant woman , with the best of manners . she is the same age as emma . she is extraordinarily well-educated and talented at singing and playing the piano ; she is the sole person whom emma envies . mr. woodhouse adopted a laissez faire parenting style when it came to raising emma . in fact , most of the time it seems that emma is parenting her father , taking on the role of both daughter and mother , at the young age of twelve , in the wake of her mother 's death . emma is entirely responsible for the wellbeing of her father and therefore encumbered to stay with him . her father is a selfish but gentle man and does not approve of matrimony .
in 2008 , waters was planning to make a children 's christmas film called fruitcake starring johnny knoxville and parker posey . filming was planned for november 2008 , but it was shelved in january 2009 . in 2010 , waters told the chicago tribune that `` independent films that cost $ 5 million are very hard to get made . i sold the idea , got a development deal , got paid a great salary to write it -- and now the company is no longer around , which is the case with many independent film companies these days . '' divine appeared in waters 's next short film , the diane linkletter story -lrb- 1969 -rrb- , which was initially designed to be a test for a new sound camera . a black comedy that carried on in waters 's tradition of making `` bad taste '' films to shock conventional american society , the diane linkletter story was based upon the true story of diane linkletter , the daughter of media personality art linkletter , who had committed suicide earlier that year . her death had led to a flurry of media interest and speculation , with various sources erroneously claiming that she had done so under the influence of the psychedelic lsd . waters 's dramatized version starred divine in the leading role as the teenager who rebels against her conservative parents after they try to break up her relationship with hippie boyfriend jim , before consuming a large quantity of lsd and committing suicide . following his san francisco stay , divine returned to baltimore and participated in waters 's next film pink flamingos . designed by waters to be `` an exercise in poor taste , '' the film featured divine as babs johnson , a woman who claims to be `` the filthiest person alive '' and who is forced to prove her right to the title from challengers , connie -lrb- mink stole -rrb- and raymond marble -lrb- david lochary -rrb- . in one scene , the marbles send babs a turd in a box as a birthday present , and in order to enact this scene , divine defecated into the box the night before . filmed in a hippie commune in phoenix , maryland , the cast members spent much of the time smoking cigarettes and marijuana and taking amphetamines , although all of the scenes had been heavily rehearsed beforehand .
according to the baptist press , perkins ' `` concern about the influence of the homosexual movement '' led to his involvement in the 1998 founding of the louisiana family forum , a conservative , faith-oriented , pro-life , and non-profit group . in november 2010 , perkins was asked about sprigg 's comments regarding the criminalization of same-sex behavior : he responded that criminalizing homosexuality is not a goal of family research council . perkins repeated frc 's association of homosexuals with pedophilia , stating : `` if you look at the american college of pediatricians , they say the research is overwhelming that homosexuality poses a danger to children . '' perkins ' statements have been contradicted by mainstream social science research , and the likelihood of child molestation by homosexuals and bisexuals has been found to be no higher than child molestation by heterosexuals ; as newsweek put it , `` or decades , the has smeared homosexuals in its publications , insinuating that gay people are more likely to sexually abuse children '' and an analysis by john aravosis concluded that frc `` cherry-picks and distorts evidence as part of a deliberate campaign to smear the lgbt community . '' some scientists whose work is cited by the socially conservative advocacy group the american college of pediatricians -- which was created following the american academy of pediatrics ' endorsement of adoption by same-sex couples and to which frc points for evidence supporting its positions -- have said the organization has distorted or misrepresented their work and the organization has been criticized by psychology today for making `` false statements ... that have the potential to harm lgbt youth '' . the family research institute -lrb- fri -rrb- , originally known as the institute for the scientific investigation of sexuality -lrb- isis -rrb- , is an american socially conservative non-profit organization based in colorado springs , colorado which states that it has '' ... one overriding mission : to generate empirical research on issues that threaten the traditional family , particularly homosexuality , aids , sexual social policy , and drug abuse '' . the fri is part of a sociopolitical movement of socially conservative christian organizations which seek to influence the political debate in the united states . they seek '' ... to restore a world where marriage is upheld and honored , where children are nurtured and protected , and where homosexuality is not taught and accepted , but instead is discouraged and rejected at every level .

in her review in the new york times , michiko kakutani writes , `` in miss tyler 's capable hands , ... the morans ' outing ... becomes a metaphor both for their 28-year marital odyssey , and for the halting , circuitous journey all of us make through life - away from and back to our family roots , out of innocence into sorrow , wisdom and loss . to followers of the author 's work , the morans will be instantly recognizable as tyler creations . there 's a quaint , homespun quality to them that , given a less talented and generous writer , might seem cloying or sentimental ... miss tyler is able to examine , again , the conflict , felt by nearly all her characters , between domesticity and freedom , between heredity and independence . in addition , she is able , with her usual grace and magnanimity , to chronicle the ever-shifting covenants made by parents and children , husbands and wives , and in doing so , to depict both the losses - and redemptions - wrought by the passage of time . '' edward hoagland describes the novel : `` maggie , surprised by life , which did not live up to her honeymoon , has become an incorrigible prompter . and she has horned in to bring about the birth of her first grandchild by stopping a 17-year-old girl named fiona at the door of an abortion clinic and steering her into marrying maggie 's son , jesse , who is the father and , like fiona , a dropout from high school ... the book 's principal event is a 90-mile trip that maggie and ira make from baltimore ... to a country town in pennsylvania where a high school classmate has suddenly scheduled an elaborate funeral for her husband . maggie ... indulges her habit of pouring her heart out to every listening stranger , which naturally infuriates ira , who , uncommunicative to start with , has reached the point where maggie can divine his moods only from the pop songs of the 1950s that he whistles ... maggie , although exasperating , ... is trying to make a difference , to connect or unite people , beat the drum for forgiveness and compromise . as ira explains , `` it 's maggie 's weakness . tate 's writing style is often described as surrealistic , comic and absurdist . his work has captivated other poets as diverse as john ashbery and dana gioia . regarding his own work , tate said , `` my characters usually are -- or , i 'd say most often , i do n't want to generalize too much -- but most often they 're in trouble , and they 're trying to find some kind of life . '' this view is supported by the poet tony hoagland 's observation that `` his work of late has been in prose poems , in which his picaresque speaker or characters are spinning through life , inquisitive and clueless as candide , trying to identify and get with the fiction of whatever world they are in . ''
hersh has written a series of articles for the new yorker magazine detailing military and security matters surrounding the us-led invasion and subsequent occupation of iraq . in march 2002 , he described the planning process for a new invasion of iraq that he alleged had been on-going since the end of the first gulf war , under the leadership of cheney , paul wolfowitz , fried and other neo-conservatives . in a 2004 article , he alleged that vice president dick cheney and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld circumvented the normal intelligence analysis function of the cia in their quest to make the case for the 2003 invasion of iraq . another article , `` lunch with the chairman '' , led richard perle , a subject of the article , to call hersh the `` closest thing american journalism has to a terrorist . '' a phone call on 22 october 1969 , answered by freelance investigative journalist , seymour hersh , and his subsequent independent inquiry , broke the wall of silence that was surrounding the mỹ lai massacre . hersh initially tried to sell the story to life and look magazines ; both turned it down . hersh then went to the small washington-based dispatch news service , which sent it to fifty major american newspapers ; thirty of them accepted it for publication . new york times reporter henry kamm investigated further and found several mỹ lai massacre survivors in south vietnam . lieutenant general steven arnold , interviewed by hersh for the article , was one of the officers who later claimed to have been misquoted . he wrote to the editor of the new yorker , saying , `` i know that my brief comments in the article were not depicted in an entirely accurate manner and were taken out of context ... . when the iraqi forces fired on elements of the 24th infantry division , they were clearly committing a hostile act . i regret having granted an interview with mr. hersh .
republicans are freaking out about donald trump , but the candidate himself is insisting his campaign has never been in better shape . trump took the stage in daytona beach , florida , on wednesday with his presidential bid apparently floundering . republican leaders and even senior members of his own team expressed frustration with his political meltdown on tuesday . the gop nominee tried to stem the growing panic -- addressing the state of his campaign right at the top of his speech . the front page of wednesday 's new york daily news called for donald trump to end his presidential campaign -- writing , `` this is n't a joke any more . '' in an editorial posted online tuesday night , the newspaper called for trump to end his campaign following comments the candidate made on tuesday that some saw as a threat of violence toward his rival hillary clinton . `` donald trump must end his campaign for the white house in a reckoning with his own madness , while praying that nothing comes of his musing about an assassination of hillary clinton , '' the paper wrote . trump said at a campaign stop in north carolina on tuesday that `` hillary wants to abolish -- essentially abolish the second amendment . we ca n't be certain of what donald trump exactly intended when he warned his supporters about how a president hillary clinton would jettison the right to bear arms and then said : `` if she gets to pick her judges , nothing you can do folks . although the second amendment people -- maybe there is , i do n't know . '' some supporters , as well as some republican opponents of the nominee , insist he was referring to how gun rights supporters would mobilize politically to defeat her . some others -- on both sides of the aisle -- had a different reaction , namely that the republican presidential candidate was raising the specter of assassination .
duke tip was founded in 1980 by a grant from the duke endowment . at the time , the goal of the program was to identify and provide educational opportunities to help the children reach their full educational potential . the program initially focused on seventh graders , and has since expanded to grades four through twelve , allowing the program full reach of middle and high school students . on september 29 , 2007 , duke president brodhead , speaking at a two-day conference at duke law school on the practice and ethics of trying cases in the media , apologized for `` causing the families to feel abandoned when they most needed support . '' a duke university spokesperson responded that `` e have now seen the lawsuit and as we said before , if these plaintiffs have a complaint , it is with mr. nifong . their legal strategy -- attacking duke -- is misdirected and without merit . to help these families move on , duke offered to cover the cost of any attorneys ' fees or other out-of-pocket expenses , but they rejected this offer . we will vigorously defend the university against these claims .

the company was initially named `` hng/internorth inc. '' , even though internorth was technically the parent . at the outset , segnar was ceo for a short time , before he was fired by the board of directors whereupon lay was tapped to be the new ceo . lay moved the headquarters of the new company back to energy capital houston . the company then set out to find a new name , spent upwards of $ 100,000 in focus groups and consulting before `` enteron '' was suggested . in 1584 richard hakluyt , archdeacon of london 's westminster abbey and preeminent geographer in europe , published a manuscript titled a discourse of western planting , in which he advocated the colonization of north america for the `` employmente of numbers of idle men '' to extract its natural resources for exportation to england . among the commodities listed as marketable goods was trees . it was hakluyt 's belief that north america and its endless stock of resources would solve the nation 's dilemma . hakluyt projected that an established lumber industry would deliver returns that would in itself justify investment in settling the area that was becoming commonly known by several names including ; norumbega , acadia , virginia or new england . in australia , the regional forest agreement -lrb- rfa -rrb- attempted to prevent the clearfelling of defined `` old-growth forests '' . this led to struggles over what constitutes `` old growth '' . for example , in western australia , the timber industry tried to limit the area of old growth in the karri forests of the southern forests region ; this led to the creation of the western australian forests alliance , the splitting of the liberal government of western australia and the election of the gallop labor government . old-growth forests in this region have now been placed inside national parks .
russian president vladimir putin and north korean leader kim jong un will meet in russia later this month , the kremlin announced thursday . the meeting between the cold war allies comes at a delicate moment in the nuclear negotiations between north korea and the united states , which have stalled since the last round of talks in hanoi fell apart earlier this year . the kremlin did not provide any further details about the meeting between kim and putin , who are not believed to have ever met each other . the announcement came just hours after north korea 's foreign ministry called for us secretary of state mike pompeo to be replaced in any further negotiations between the two countries . the us does not believe north korea successfully launched a fully operational new weapon after pyongyang claimed it had conducted a `` new tactical guided weapons firing test '' on wednesday , according to a us official directly familiar with the latest assessment . the initial us intelligence assessment is north korea tested components for an anti-tank weapon , rather than a fully operational new weapon , the official told cnn on thursday . the assessment is based on a review of information gathered from satellites and aircraft that did not register any indication of a launch of any type of short-range tactical weapon or a ballistic missile , the official said . north korea 's state media agency reported that the country 's leader kim jong un inspected and directed the test . north korea 's foreign ministry has issued a stinging rebuke of united states secretary of state mike pompeo , hours after the country claimed to have tested a new tactical weapon . in a statement released by the state-run korean central news agency , foreign ministry official kwon jong gun said pompeo had been `` letting loose reckless remarks and sophism of all kinds against us every day . '' kwon said north korean leader kim jong un had made his `` principled stand '' on negotiations between pyongyang and washington clear in a recent speech to the country 's rubberstamp parliament . `` everyone has a clear interpretation of his speech which says that the us should change its way of calculation and come up with responsive measures before the end of this year , '' kwon said .
americans with disabilities are fighting for the right to save money without getting their government benefits cut off . in order to qualify for government benefits like social security disability insurance and medicaid payments , recipients typically must have no more than $ 2,000 in assets and earn less than approximately $ 700 a month . anything more than those amounts and the benefits stop . sara wolff , a 31-year-old from pennsylvania who has down syndrome , argues that the savings limits make it next to impossible for disabled americans to save for needs like health care , housing and education without losing their benefits . americans are nationals and citizens of the united states of america . although nationals and citizens make up the majority of americans , some dual citizens , expatriates , and permanent residents may also claim american nationality . the united states is home to people of many different ethnic origins . as a result , american culture and law does not equate nationality with race or ethnicity , but with citizenship and permanent allegiance .

repealing major obamacare provisions without a replacement plan in place would quickly strip 18 million americans of their insurance and cause premiums to skyrocket , according to a new congressional budget office report released tuesday . the number of uninsured people could climb to 32 million by 2026 , the report from the nonpartisan office said . premiums , which would rise by up to 25 % initially , would double by 2026 . though the bill the cbo studied is no longer in play , the findings lay out the daunting challenge republicans and president-elect donald trump have ahead as they seek to fulfill their promise to swiftly repeal the affordable care act . republican lawmakers are in the dark about president-elect donald trump 's plan to repeal obamacare and are frustrated he is emphasizing `` insurance for everybody , '' three senior gop sources told cnn on tuesday . those sources said republicans are working on a strategy to dismantle and replace the law in pieces . the comments come after trump told the washington post this weekend that he is nearly done crafting a plan that has `` insurance for everybody '' as its goal , although his transition team quickly walked back those remarks monday . trump promises his obamacare replacement plan will cover everybody , report says lawmakers want to focus on lowering costs , not expanding coverage , which is one of the democrats ' main talking points . president-elect donald trump is putting the finishing touches on an obamacare replacement plan that aims to provide `` insurance for everybody , '' he told the washington post . also , he will demand that drug companies negotiate directly with medicare and medicaid and lower their prices , saying they will no longer be `` politically protected .

on the 500th anniversary of leonardo 's death , the louvre in paris arranged for the largest ever single exhibit of his work , called leonardo , between november 2019 and february 2020 . the exhibit includes over 100 paintings , drawings and notebooks . eleven of the paintings that leonardo completed in his lifetime were included . five of these are owned by the louvre , but the mona lisa was not included because it is in such great demand among general visitors to the louvre ; it remains on display in its gallery . among the works created by leonardo in the 16th century is the small portrait known as the mona lisa or la gioconda , the laughing one . in the present era , it is arguably the most famous painting in the world . its fame rests , in particular , on the elusive smile on the woman 's face , its mysterious quality perhaps due to the subtly shadowed corners of the mouth and eyes such that the exact nature of the smile can not be determined . the shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called `` sfumato , '' or leonardo 's smoke . leonardo had left borgia 's service and returned to florence by early 1503 , where he rejoined the guild of saint luke on 18 october of that year . by this same month , leonardo had begun working on a portrait of lisa del giocondo , the model for the mona lisa , which he would continue working on until his twilight years . in january 1504 , he was part of a committee formed to recommend where michelangelo 's statue of david should be placed . he then spent two years in florence designing and painting a mural of the battle of anghiari for the signoria , with michelangelo designing its companion piece , the battle of cascina .
in 1936 , his new organization achieved national recognition by correctly predicting , from the replies of only 50,000 respondents , that franklin roosevelt would defeat alf landon in the u.s. presidential election . this was in direct contradiction to the widely-respected literary digest magazine whose poll based on over two million returned questionnaires predicted that landon would be the winner . not only did gallup get the election right , he correctly predicted the results of the literary digest poll , as well using a random sample smaller than theirs but chosen to match it . in 2012 , gallup 's final election survey had mitt romney at 49 % and barack obama at 48 % , compared to the final election results showing obama with 51.1 % to romney 's 47.2 % . poll analyst nate silver found that gallup 's results were the least accurate of the 23 major polling firms silver analyzed , having the highest incorrect average of being 7.2 points away from the final result . frank newport , the editor-in-chief of gallup , responded to the criticism by stating that gallup simply makes an estimate of the national popular vote rather than predicting the winner and that their final poll was within the statistical margin of error . newport also criticized analysts such as silver who aggregate and analyze other people 's polls , stating that `` it 's much easier , cheaper , and mostly less risky to focus on aggregating and analyzing others ' polls . '' gallup 's most admired man and woman poll is an annual poll that gallup has conducted at the end of most years since 1948 . americans are asked , without prompting , to say what man and woman `` living today in any part of the world , do admire most ? '' the result is published as a top ten list . most years the most admired man is the sitting president of the united states and the most admired woman is or has been the first lady of the united states .

'' the strength of the album 's lead single , `` bye bye bye '' , its music video , along with internet song previews for the album , provided for that build up . both jive records and the band 's management credited the album 's early success to the anticipation amassed over the two years since they released their self-titled debut album , the highly publicized legal battle and the media blitz leading up to the release . despite the mania that no strings attached stirred in the wake of its debut , mtv reported the `` record week may not have been simply the result of a wide fan base and effective marketing '' . after spending more than a year recording , the backstreet boys finally released their comeback album never gone on june 14 , 2005 . the album debuted at no. 3 on the u.s. chart with first week sales of 291,000 copies . however , the drastic style change drew negative criticism from rolling stone .
the bulls ' record of 47-35 was good enough for the # 4 seed in the eastern conference . in the first round of the playoffs the bulls met another young team on the upswing , the washington wizards . the bulls would lose the series 4-2 , staying competitive throughout most of the series , but ultimately unable to find an answer for wizards star gilbert arenas . the bulls also entered the series nursing injuries . hair created dozens of paintings at a time . he later hired friends to drive along the highways , selling his paintings door-to-door for $ 20 or $ 25 . according to fellow members of the highwaymen , hair had vowed that his art would make him millionaire by the time he was 35 years old . as a youth , carradine had opportunities to appear on stage with his father in the latter 's productions of shakespeare . thus , he had some background in theater when he was cast in the original broadway run of hair -lrb- 1969 -rrb- , which launched his acting career . in that production he started out in the chorus and worked his way up to the lead roles playing woof and claude . he said of his involvement in hair , `` i really did n't plan to audition .
in 2016 , canadian news magazine maclean 's reported that bush supported theresa may , then conservative prime minister of the united kingdom . it quoted bush as saying : `` i actually really like her and think she 's wonderful . i think it 's the best thing that 's happened to us in a long time ... it is great to have a woman in charge of the country . bush supported his son 's candidacy in the 2000 presidential election , but did not actively campaign in the election and did not deliver a speech at the 2000 republican national convention . george w. bush defeated al gore in the 2000 election and was re-elected in 2004 . bush and his son thus became the second father -- son pair to each serve as president of the united states , following john adams and john quincy adams . through previous administrations , the elder bush had ubiquitously been known as `` george bush '' or `` president bush '' , but following his son 's election the need to distinguish between them has made retronymic forms such as `` george h. w. bush '' and `` george bush sr. '' and colloquialisms such as `` bush 41 '' and `` bush the elder '' more common . the term `` to go bush '' has several similar meanings all connected with the supposed wildness of the bush . it can mean to revert to a feral nature -lrb- or to `` go native '' -rrb- , and it can also mean to deliberately leave normal surroundings and live rough , with connotations of cutting off communication with the outside world -- often as a means of evading capture or questioning by the police . the term bushwhacker is used in australia and new zealand to mean someone who spends his or her time in the bush .
the cook islands and niue , which are both associated states of new zealand , are not members of the un , but are members of specialized agencies of the un such as who and unesco , and have had their `` full treaty-making capacity '' recognized by united nations secretariat in 1992 and 1994 respectively . they have since become parties to a number of international treaties which the un secretariat acts as a depositary for , such as the united nations framework convention on climate change and the united nations convention on the law of the sea , and are treated as non-member states . both the cook islands and niue have expressed a desire to become a un member state , but new zealand has said that they would not support the application without a change in their constitutional relationship , in particular their right to new zealand citizenship . the reform proposals were not taken up by the united nations world summit in september 2005 . instead , the summit solely affirmed the central position of the general assembly as the chief deliberative , policymaking and representative organ of the united nations , as well as the advisory role of the assembly in the process of standard-setting and the codification of international law . the summit also called for strengthening the relationship between the general assembly and the other principal organs to ensure better coordination on topical issues that required coordinated action by the united nations , in accordance with their respective mandates . in the general debate of the 65th general assembly , jorge valero , representing venezuela , said `` the united nations has exhausted its model and it is not simply a matter of proceeding with reform , the twenty-first century demands deep changes that are only possible with a rebuilding of this organisation . '' he pointed to the futility of resolutions concerning the cuban embargo and the middle east conflict as reasons for the un model having failed . venezuela also called for the suspension of veto rights in the security council because it was a `` remnant of the second world war is incompatible with the principle of sovereign equality of states '' .
beginning in 1936 , the railway line that the depot serviced was the route for the famed twin cities 400 . railway operations ceased at the depot in 1963 . currently , it houses the reedsburg chamber of commerce and the headquarters for the 400 trail . the railway line , however , remains in use by wisconsin and southern railroad . the landmark waunakee railroad depot located in the central part of town is listed on the national register of historic places . it now houses the waunakee area chamber of commerce offices . susie the duck has been the town 's official mascot since 1948 . on wisconsin highway 113 in downtown lodi is a small creek-side park where visitors can buy dried corn from vending machines to feed the wild ducks . in this area is a small stone basket , inscribed with the name of former lodi resident engle knerzer , and every year a duck builds a nest there . when the first mallard settled in that location in 1948 , it was nicknamed `` susie '' by the granddaughter of the police chief .
pretz -lrb- プリッツ , purittsu -rrb- is a japanese snack made by ezaki glico . like ezaki glico 's other popular snack , pocky , pretz is stick-shaped and comes with a texture similar to pretzels . unlike pocky , pretz is dusted with seasonings instead of enrobed in a flavoured fudge . pretz comes in a few varieties and three sizes : regular , kid 's , and giant . after the inaugural ceremony on the west front of the u.s. capitol , president obama , first lady michelle obama , vice president joe biden and dr. jill biden escorted former president george w. bush and former first lady laura bush to a departure ceremony on the east side of the u.s. capitol . before the luncheon and in keeping with tradition , president obama signed his first presidential orders in the president 's room at the capitol , and then signed the guest book for the luncheon . the first order signed by obama was a proclamation declaring his inauguration day a `` national day of renewal and reconciliation '' , in which he called `` upon all of our citizens to serve one another and the common purpose of remaking this nation for our new century '' . next , obama signed orders to officially present the nominations for his cabinet and several sub‑cabinet officials to the u.s. congress for its approval . the first inauguration of barack obama as the 44th president of the united states took place on tuesday , january 20 , 2009 . the inauguration , which set a record attendance for any event held in washington , d.c. , marked the commencement of the first term of barack obama as president and joe biden as vice president . based on combined attendance numbers , television viewership , and internet traffic , it was one of the most-observed events ever by the global audience .
that afternoon , weber took off from enterprise with a composite attack group made up of the remnants of the several groups decimated earlier . at about 15:45 , planes from vs-6 and 14 from yorktown 's vb-3 joined with the four operational aircraft remaining to vb-6 and sped off in chase of the remaining carrier . unfortunately , the american fighters still extant had to remain with the carriers as combat air patrol so the attack group was denuded of fighter cover . in weber 's critique of the left , he complained of the leaders of the leftist spartacus league -- which was led by karl liebknecht and rosa luxemburg and controlled the city government of berlin while weber was campaigning for his party -- `` we have this revolution to thank for the fact that we can not send a single division against the poles . all we see is dirt , muck , dung , and horse-play -- nothing else . liebknecht belongs in the madhouse and rosa luxemburg in the zoological gardens . '' weber was at the same time critical of the versailles treaty , which he believed unjustly assigned `` war guilt '' to germany when it came to world war i. weber believed that many countries were guilty of starting world war i , not just germany . he also appeared in live-action films . among the ones he starred in are those from disney : man of the house , tom and huck , and i 'll be home for christmas . other live-action films starring thomas are an adaptation of the adventures of pinocchio -lrb- in which he played the titular character -rrb- , wild america , speedway junky , and walking across egypt .
chevrolet designer clare mackichan recalled about creating the chevy ii : `` there was no time for experimentation or doodling around with new ideas from either the engineers or from us in design ; and it had to be a basic-type car . '' the 1962 chevy ii rode a 110-inch wheelbase , compared to 109.5 for the ford falcon , at which chevy 's new compact was aimed . `` i think that was the quickest program we ever did at any time , '' he continued . `` we worked night and day on that car , and it did n't take very long to run it through our shop because we had a deadline . '' in 2018 , it was virtually impossible to order the car in europe -lrb- though in november 2018 , it was reported to be on sale in the netherlands at a price of $ 53,000 -rrb- . statistics show that , as of february 2019 , a total of less than 5,000 bolts were ever delivered in the entirety of europe . the new owner of the opel brand offered the opel crossland x , a gasoline - or diesel-powered car with styling mildly reminiscent of the bolt , to the customers , and suggested it 's going to make two evs based on the opel corsa and the peugeot 208 -lrb- both being low-powered cars of smaller interior volume than the bolt -rrb- . there was a lot of debate within the chevrolet organization over just what to call this new car , and the decision to go with `` chevy ii '' was a very late one . among the finalists was nova . it lost out because it did n't start with a `` c , '' but was selected as the name for the top-of-the-line series . ultimately the nova badge would replace chevy ii , but that would n't happen until 1969 .
in my career , i 've never been accused of grade inflation but i found wednesday evening 's debate to be the best overall this season -- so my grade book runneth over . my two as really were a tie at the top . a pete buttigieg mayor pete demonstrated some sweet debating techniques that i teach , yet rarely see deployed as well as he did last night . he pivoted questions to keep his answers on topic , but still unique from the other candidates -- and by doing so he provided himself with an advantage . the fifth democratic debate of the 2020 presidential campaign is in the books . with only six candidates having qualified for the next debate in december , this was a last-chance , uh , chance for some of them to make the case to voters that they deserve to stay in this race . i watched and took some notes on the best and the worst of the night that was . below , my winners and losers . bloomberg 's campaign manager kevin sheekey described his campaign as `` thrilled that voters could soon have the chance to see mike bloomberg on the debate stage , hear his vision for the country , and see why he is the strongest candidate to defeat donald trump and bring our country together . mike has run for office three times and never taken a dime from special interests , allowing him to act independently , on the merits , without having to do what donors expect . he is proud to be doing the same with this campaign . ''
by the end of the 1960s , the trend of exploring psychedelia in music was largely in retreat . lsd was declared illegal in the us and uk in 1966 . the linking of the murders of sharon tate and leno and rosemary labianca by the manson family to beatles songs such as `` helter skelter '' contributed to an anti-hippie backlash . the altamont free concert in california , headlined by the rolling stones on december 6 , 1969 , did not turn out to be a positive milestone in the psychedelic music scene , as was anticipated ; instead , it became notorious for the fatal stabbing of a black teenager meredith hunter by hells angels security guards . at an event on 3 october 2019 , stewart announced he had resigned from the conservative party and would stand down as an mp at the next general election . he read out a letter in which a housemaster at eton college described boris johnson as being guilty of `` a gross failure of responsibility '' . the next day , stewart confirmed his resignation on twitter , saying : `` it 's been a great privilege to serve penrith and the border for the last ten years , so it is with sadness that i am announcing that i will be standing down . '' stewart had considered a parliamentary career in the past but only decided to stand when , in the aftermath of the expenses scandal , david cameron decided to `` reopen the conservative candidates ' list to anybody who wants to apply '' . stewart has said that his experience in afghanistan made him a `` burkean conservative '' . having never voted for the conservatives before -lrb- though , against his will , his parents cast his proxy vote for them in the 2001 general election , when he was abroad -rrb- , he joined the party in summer 2009 . stewart tried for selection for the bracknell constituency in the 2010 general election , but the place went to phillip lee .
the associated students of the university of oregon -lrb- asuo -rrb- is the student government at the university of oregon . it is a non-profit organization funded by the university of oregon . its purpose is to provide for the social , cultural , educational and physical development of its members , and for the advancement of their individual and collective interests both within and without the university . membership consists of all students at the university of oregon , who have paid the current term or semester student incidental fee . elmo stevenson -- for whom the stevenson union would later be named -- took over as president in 1946 and rebuilt the school 's enrollment from a low of 45 at the close of world war ii to nearly 800 less than three years after his arrival . he became the institution 's longest-serving president to date , retiring in 1969 from what had been renamed southern oregon college -- to reflect more diverse course offerings -- in 1956 . in the 1957 season oregon tied oregon state for the conference title , but earned the rose bowl bid because of the conference no-repeat rule . the webfoots lost 10 -- 7 to the heavily favored and number one ranked ohio state university in the 1958 rose bowl . braven dyer of the los angeles times , who had picked ohio state to win by a 48 -- 14 score , said : `` the score of 10 -- 7 was a complete moral victory for the underdog ducks from eugene who had been doped to lose by three touchdowns . they lost , but at day 's end there were n't many fans who were willing to concede that the better team had won . ''
on january 13 , 2012 , president obama announced his intentions to ask the united states congress for the power to close the department and replace it with a new cabinet-level agency focused on trade and exports . the new agency would include the office of the united states trade representative , currently part of the executive office of the president , as well as the export-import bank of the united states , the overseas private investment corporation , the united states trade and development agency , and the small business administration , which are all currently independent agencies . the obama administration projected that the reorganization would save $ 3 billion and would help the administration 's goal of doubling u.s. exports in five years . the new agency would be organized around four `` pillars '' : a technology and innovation office including the united states patent and trademark office and the national institute of standards and technology ; a statistical division including the united states census bureau and other data-collection agencies currently in the commerce department , and also the bureau of labor statistics which would be transferred from the department of labor ; a trade and investment policy office ; and a small business development office . hoover envisioned the commerce department as the hub of the nation 's growth and stability . his experience mobilizing the war-time economy convinced him that the federal government could promote efficiency by eliminating waste , increasing production , encouraging the adoption of data-based practices , investing in infrastructure , and conserving natural resources . contemporaries described hoover 's approach as a `` third alternative '' between `` unrestrained capitalism '' and socialism , which was becoming increasingly popular in europe . hoover sought to foster a balance among labor , capital , and the government , and for this he has been variously labeled a `` corporatist '' or an associationalist . formerly , there was a u.s. secretary of commerce and labor , who led this department along with the u.s. department of commerce as one department . since the two departments split in 1913 , the department of commerce is now headed by a separate u.s. secretary of commerce .
in 2001 , the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit recognized that there were two different tests that other circuit courts had generally used to determine whether honest services fraud had been committed ; in united states v. vinyard , it concluded that the `` reasonably foreseeable economic harm '' test was superior -lrb- because it was based on employee intent and not employer response -rrb- and applied that test to the case at hand . the defendant in the case , michael vinyard , had been convicted in the united states district court for the district of south carolina of fourteen counts of mail fraud and twelve counts of money laundering . his brother , james vinyard , was an employee of the sunoco products corporation who was charged with finding an independent broker to research recycled resins for their manufacture of plastic bags . the brothers instead created their own brokerage , `` charles stewart enterprises , '' incorporated in the state of iowa , and misrepresented it to sunoco as an legitimate , independent firm that was supplying recycled resins at the lowest possible price . after all the missions are completed , the `` site b '' mode is unlocked , which allows the player to create an island without any fences or buildings for people . visitors are not allowed on the island . the player can place up to eight hatcheries and create up to sixty dinosaurs , which live on the island without diseases or the possibility of becoming stressed . as long as they have food , water and living space , the player can simply watch the dinosaurs interact and live out their lives . reviewing the playstation 2 and xbox versions , ign praised the game 's camera system , but criticized the ability to control the game 's land cruisers and helicopters , saying they `` are n't as engaging as they should be . '' ign also noted the graphics to be , `` repetitive and bland '' . joe rybicki of official u.s. playstation magazine wrote , `` i have exactly one complaint : it only took me about eight hours or so to get a 5-star rating , effectively beating the main area of the game . so , it may be a bit too easy for veterans of the genre .
at the moment of impact , secretary of defense donald rumsfeld was in his office on the other side of the pentagon , away from the crash site . he ran to the site and assisted the injured . rumsfeld returned to his office , and went to a conference room in the executive support center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with vice president dick cheney and other officials . on the day of the attacks , dod officials considered moving their command operations to site r , a backup facility in pennsylvania . cheney has said his time at the pentagon was the most rewarding period of his public service career , calling it `` the one that stands out . '' in 2014 , cheney recounted that when he met with president george h. w. bush to accept the offer , he passed a painting in the private residence entitled the peacemakers , which depicted president lincoln , general grant , and william tecumseh sherman . `` my great-grandfather had served under william tecumseh sherman throughout the war , '' cheney said , `` and it occurred to me as i was in the room as i walked in to talk to the president about becoming secretary of defense , i wondered what he would have thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the white house with the president talking about taking over the reins of the u.s. military . '' in october 1975 , ford reshuffled his cabinet in the halloween massacre . he named rumsfeld to become the 13th u.s. secretary of defense ; george h. w. bush became director of central intelligence . according to bob woodward 's 2002 book bush at war , a rivalry developed between the two men and `` bush senior was convinced that rumsfeld was pushing him out to the cia to end his political career .

a horde of zombies are washed onto the island by the tides , causing panic in the camp . while they are defeated , many of the refugees are killed , and two are infected by the virus , one of them being halpern 's daughter , julie -lrb- kerisse hutchinson -rrb- . the survivors decide to set out for the mainland , while halpern stays to study the two infected victims . later in the film , halpern is forced to kill himself by detonating a grenade when his daughter bites him , before the virus can claim him as well . bellisario married lynn halpern , in 1979 and they divorced in 1984 . they had a son , michael bellisario , on april 7 , 1980 -lrb- had a recurring role as midshipman michael roberts on jag and played charles `` chip '' sterling on ncis -rrb- . brown replaced john shearin as roger forbes on loving during its early days , but was written out after only a couple of months . from 1986-1987 , he played charles sanders , former ambassador to mendorra , on one life to live the character had a heart attack and died on the evening of his wedding to lee halpern . he subsequently played blake hayes on the bold and the beautiful , the ex-husband of dr. taylor hamilton hayes .
iran -lrb- persian : ایران irān -lrb- listen -rrb- -rrb- , also called persia , and officially the islamic republic of iran -lrb- persian : جمهوری اسلامی ایران jomhuri-ye eslāmi-ye irān -lrb- listen -rrb- -rrb- , is a country in western asia . with 82 million inhabitants , iran is the world 's 18th most populous country . its territory spans 1,648,195 km2 -lrb- 636,372 sq mi -rrb- , making it the second largest country in the middle east and the 17th largest in the world . iran is bordered to the northwest by armenia and the republic of azerbaijan , to the north by the caspian sea , to the northeast by turkmenistan , to the east by afghanistan and pakistan , to the south by the persian gulf and the gulf of oman , and to the west by turkey and iraq . sunni islam -lrb- -rrb- is the largest denomination of islam , followed by 87 -- 90 % of the world 's muslims . its name comes from the word sunnah , referring to the behaviour of the islamic prophet muhammad . the differences between sunni and shia muslims arose from a disagreement over the succession to muhammad and subsequently acquired broader political significance , as well as theological and juridical dimensions.according to sunni traditions , muhammad did not clearly designate a successor and the muslim community acted according to his sunnah in electing his father-in-law abu bakr as the first caliph . this contrasts with the shia view , which holds that muhammad announced his son-in-law and cousin ali ibn abi talib as his successor , most notably at ghadir khumm . shia islam or shi'ism is one of the two main branches of islam . it holds that the islamic prophet muhammad designated ali ibn abi talib as his successor and the imam -lrb- leader -rrb- after him , most notably at the event of ghadir khumm , but was prevented from the caliphate as a result of the incident of saqifah . this view primarily contrasts with that of sunni islam , whose adherents believe that muhammad did not appoint a successor and consider abu bakr , who was appointed caliph by a small group of muslims at saqifah , to be the first rightful caliph after the prophet.unlike the first three rashidun caliphs , ali was from the same clan as muhammad , banu hashim , as well as being the prophet 's cousin and being the first male to become muslim.shia islam is the second largest branch of islam : as of the late 2000s , shia muslims constituted 10 -- 15 % of all muslims . twelver shia is the largest branch of shia islam , with 2012 estimates saying that 85 % of shias were twelvers.shia islam is based on the prophet 's hadith -lrb- ghadir khumm -rrb- .
institute professor is the highest title that can be awarded to a faculty member at the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , a research university located in cambridge , massachusetts , united states . it is analogous to the titles of distinguished professor , university professor , or regents professor used at other universities in recognition of a professor 's extraordinary research achievements and dedication to the school . the position was created by president james r. killian in 1951 , and john c. slater was the first to hold the position . at mit , institute professors are granted a unique level of freedom and flexibility to pursue their research and teaching interests without regular departmental or school responsibilities ; they report only to the provost . mit and caltech have been prank rivals since spring 2005 , when a group of caltech students traveled to cambridge to pull a string of pranks during `` campus preview weekend '' -lrb- cpw -rrb- for prospective new mit students . the stunts included covering up the word `` massachusetts '' in the `` massachusetts institute of technology '' engraving on the main building facade with a banner , so that it read `` that other institute of technology '' . a group of mit hackers quickly responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read `` the only institute of technology '' . in the following years , the science and engineering curriculum drifted away from rogers ' ideal of combining general and professional studies and became focused on more vocational or practical and less theoretical concerns . to the extent that mit had overspecialized to the detriment of other programs , `` the school up the river '' courted mit 's administration with hopes of merging the schools . an initial proposal in 1900 was cancelled after protests from mit 's alumni . in 1914 , a merger of mit and harvard 's applied science departments was formally announcedand was to begin `` when the institute will occupy its splendid new buildings in cambridge '' .
one of the restaurant 's promotions is a reward for customers who finish a triple or quadruple bypass burger , after which they are placed on a wheelchair and wheeled out to their vehicle by their `` personal nurse '' . in 2011 , chipotle created the `` farm team '' , which is a rewards program available only by invitation from restaurant managers . the farm team members have access to a special chipotle website , where members can earn rewards , i.e. free food and t-shirts . the site offers members to , `` learn where chipotle 's food comes from , take quizzes and polls , play games and watch videos about the company '' . many americans are wondering : why go out for a burger when you can grill one at home for way cheaper ? wendy 's warned on wednesday that the recent alarming slowdown in restaurant sales is being driven by a growing gap between the rising cost of eating out and falling prices at the grocery store . `` it 's gotten a lot cheaper ... to get fresh beef at your local butcher and go home and grill it , '' wendy 's executives said during a conference call with analysts . higher prices at restaurants is a side effect of higher minimum wages that have gone into effect in many states and also a healthier jobs market that has forced employers to pay their workers more .
in 1963 , ramirez fulfilled a promise to take over miss bravo 's studio upon her retirement . in 1967 , with federal funding through an anti-poverty program , she conceived and directed an intensive training program for younger students called `` operation high hopes . '' in addition to teaching , ramirez arranged performances for her young students . while she demanded professional behavior of them , she was aware that there were few opportunities for latinos in professional dance at the time . in august 2003 , lopez starred opposite affleck in the romantic comedy gigli . the film was a box office bomb , and is considered one of the worst films of all time . the film 's poor reception was attributed to negative press preceding its release , as well as the media attention surrounding lopez and affleck 's engagement which largely overshadowed the film . lopez would later describe this as the lowest point of her career , saying '' was very tough '' , `` the tabloid press had just come into existence at the time , so i was like a poster child for that moment . '' the murder in texas took place before ramirez 's first known killing . kit initially speaks with ramirez by phone through glass ; he refuses to reveal anything until they meet in a visitation room . there , he demands she remove her gold jewelry ; he says that he is a satanist , and gold is offensive to satan because it is god 's metal . he remains uncooperative because guards are in the room , but suggests that they can have privacy if she says she 's his lawyer .
massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren said thursday she was not thinking `` in terms of the politics '' when asked if she was worried discussions of former vice president joe biden in the ongoing impeachment trial were strengthening biden 's presidential bid . democrats allege president donald trump abused his office by directing a pressure campaign for ukraine to announce an investigation into biden and his son , hunter , in exchange for $ 400 million in us security aid and a white house meeting . trump , democrats say , then stonewalled congressional investigators to cover up the misconduct . there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either biden , and joe biden has repeatedly defended his son and himself . former vice president joe biden said wednesday that he would not make a deal where he would testify at the impeachment trial in exchange for the testimonies of former and current top trump officials . `` the reason why i would not make the deal , the bottom line is , i , this is a constitutional issue . and we 're not going to turn it into a farce , into some kind of political theater , '' biden , a democratic presidential candidate , said at an event in osage , iowa . the senate impeachment trial of president donald trump is underway in washington . in september 2008 , biden spoke at the washington conference of the national jewish democratic council -lrb- njdc -rrb- . biden stated that `` i 've spent 35 years of my career dealing with issues relating to israel . my support for israel begins in my stomach , goes to my heart and ends up in my head . '' regarding barack obama 's stance on israel , biden stated that `` i guarantee you , i would not have joined barack obama as his vice president if i had any doubt , even the slightest doubt , that he shares the same commitment to israel i share .

the boston red sox are an american professional baseball team based in boston , massachusetts . they compete in major league baseball -lrb- mlb -rrb- as a member club of the american league -lrb- al -rrb- east division . the team have won nine world series championships , tied for the third-most of any mlb team , and they have played in 13 . their most recent world series appearance and win was in 2018 . the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical , geographical , and political context in which it is used . american is derived from america , a term originally denoting all of the new world -lrb- also called the americas -rrb- . in some expressions , it retains this pan-american sense , but its usage has evolved over time and , for various historical reasons , the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america . in modern english , american generally refers to persons or things related to the united states of america ; among native english speakers this usage is almost universal , with any other use of the term requiring specification . american english -lrb- ame , ae , ameng , useng , en-us -rrb- , sometimes called united states english or u.s. english , is the set of varieties of the english language native to the united states . american english is a particularly influential form of english worldwide.english is the most widely spoken language in the united states and is the de facto common language used by the federal and state governments , to the extent that all laws and compulsory education presume english as the primary language . english is explicitly given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments . while the local courts in some divisions of the united states grant equivalent status to both english and another language -- for example , english and spanish in puerto rico -- under federal law , english is still the official language for any matters being referred to the united states district court for the territory.the use of english in the united states is a result of british colonization of the americas .
president donald trump , while often unpredictable , has been entirely consistent in two ways . first , he loves to claim credit for anything good that happens . and , second , he will not only refuse to accept responsibility for anything that goes wrong , he will blame others for it . and it appears trump is staying true to form in response to the unfolding ukraine scandal . in washington this week , president donald trump had his hands full , trying to climb out of the seemingly endless swirl of negativism that has come on the heels of an ongoing impeachment inquiry . meanwhile , his wife , the first lady of the united states , spent thursday and friday climbing through big sky country , enjoying a nature walk with kids in jackson hole , and moose , wyoming , even , according to a member of her communications team , spotting a bald eagle roosting in a tree alongside a bucolic riverbank . as president trump back home takes it from all sides -- a barrage of accusations and innuendos about misuse of presidential power , and fires back at democrats , doubling down on his defense of goading the leaders of ukraine and china to look into his political opponent , melania trump quite literally floated away from it all , downstream , in a raft on wyoming 's snake river , the still-warm october sun shining on her very first trip to grand teton territory . `` the trip -lrb- to wyoming -rrb- had been in the planning stages for a couple of months , '' her spokeswoman , white house press secretary stephanie grisham told cnn . stop me if you 've heard this one : mitt romney has emerged as the face of the republican resistance to president donald trump . unless you 've not been paying any attention , literally , to politics over the past four years , you 'd have stopped me . because romney , the 2012 republican nominee and now a senator from utah , has repeatedly spoken out against trump 's most egregious acts and statements -- only to retreat amid a verbal barrage of criticism from the president and his supporters . romney is at it again following trump 's imploring of ukraine and china to look into debunked allegations of corruption directed at joe biden and his son , hunter .
the second mystery often begins in the brown garage on rover avenue , where encyclopedia has set up his own detective agency to help neighborhood children solve cases for `` 25 cents per day , plus expenses - no case too small . '' this second case usually involves the town bully and mischief maker bugs meany , leader of a gang who call themselves the tigers , who , after being foiled , will attempt revenge in the third mystery . the satirical newspaper the onion ran an article in 2003 titled `` idaville detective ` encyclopedia ' brown found dead in library dumpster '' , which stated that encyclopedia brown , now a middle-aged police detective , had been murdered . the article parodied the books ' tendency to have crimes solved through knowledge of trivia , and ended with bugs meany , who was now police commissioner , stating that he had an alibi for the murder in that `` i was at the north pole watching the penguins . '' often , these books follow a formula wherein the first chapter involves brown solving a case at the dinner table for his father , the local police chief in the fictional seaside town of idaville in an unspecified state . when chief brown barely tastes his meal , that is a cue he was handed a difficult case . he pulls out his casebook and goes over it with the family . encyclopedia solves these cases by briefly closing his eyes while he thinks deeply , then asking a single question which directly leads to him finding the solution .
in october 2016 , the wall street journal reported that four field offices of the federal bureau of investigation -- in new york , los angeles , washington , and little rock , ark. -- had been collecting information about the clinton foundation to determine whether `` there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling . '' according to the wsj article , fbi officials presented their findings to the justice department in february 2016 , but `` the meeting did n't go well '' . justice department officials felt the cases were weak and saw little reason to continue the investigations . new us secretary of state rex tillerson introduced himself to the department thursday at his first day on the job , urging unity as he acknowledged the lingering strains of the divisive campaign and paid respects to the agency 's career men and women . `` i know this was a hotly contested election , and we do not all feel the same way about the outcome , '' the former exxonmobil ceo said , `` but we can not let our personal convictions overwhelm our ability to work as one team . '' tillerson started out with a sly joke , apologizing for arriving almost 30 minutes late because he 'd been attending a prayer breakfast led by president donald trump . `` it seemed at this year 's prayer breakfast , people felt the need to pray a little longer , '' he deadpanned , triggering laughter throughout the jam-packed department lobby where new secretaries traditionally greet the staff on their first day . two senior administration officials said thursday that the trump administration told four top state department management officials that their services were no longer needed as part of an effort to `` clean house '' at foggy bottom . patrick kennedy , who served for nine years as the undersecretary for management , assistant secretaries for administration and consular affairs joyce anne barr and michele bond , and ambassador gentry smith , director of the office for foreign missions , were sent letters by the white house that their service was no longer required , the sources told cnn . all four , career officers serving in positions appointed by the president , submitted letters of resignation per tradition at the beginning of a new administration . mexican president cancels meeting with trump the letters from the white house said that their resignations were accepted and they were thanked for their service .
later , in the month , clinton announced that she wanted a michigan delegation -lrb- and florida 's , in the same circumstance -rrb- seated at the convention , saying `` i hear all the time from people in florida and michigan that they want their voices heard in selecting the democratic nominee . i believe our nominee will need the enthusiastic support of democrats in these states to win the general election , and so i will ask my democratic convention delegates to support seating the delegations from florida and michigan . '' this seemed to contradict her previous statement on nh public radio where she said , `` well , you know , it 's clear , this election they 're having is not going to count for anything . '' the obama campaign responded that it was clear these contests were for no delegates and that `` it seems like hillary clinton will do or say anything to win an election . '' on april 12 , 2015 , clinton released a youtube video formally announcing her candidacy via email . she stated that , `` everyday americans need a champion . and i want to be that champion . '' the week following her announcement , she traveled to early primary states , such as iowa and new hampshire . `` hillary is missing in action from the palin-hating brigade '' , opines a writer at the weekly standard . former democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton referred to palin 's vp nomination as `` historic , '' stating , '' `` we should all be proud of governor sarah palin 's historic nomination , and i congratulate her and senator mccain ... while their policies would take america in the wrong direction , governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate . '' wisconsin congresswoman tammy baldwin expressed a different view : `` to the extent that this choice represents an effort to court supporters of hillary clinton 's historic candidacy , mccain misjudges the reasons so many voters rallied around her candidacy . it was senator clinton 's experience , skill and commitment to change , especially in the areas of health care and energy policy , that drew such strong support .
in 1998 , compaq acquired digital equipment corporation for a then-industry record of $ 9 billion usd . the merger made compaq , at the time , the world 's second largest computer maker in the world in terms of revenue behind ibm . digital equipment , which had nearly twice as many employees as compaq while generating half the revenue , had been a leading computer company during the 1970s and early 1980s . however , digital had struggled during the 1990s , with high operating costs . however , pfeiffer had little vision for what the combined companies should do , or indeed how the three dramatically different cultures could work as a single entity , and compaq struggled from strategy indecisiveness and lost focus , as a result being caught in between the low end and high end of the market . mark anderson , president of strategic news service , a research firm based in friday harbor , wash. was quoted as saying , `` the kind of goals he had sounded good to shareholders -- like being a $ 50 billion company by the year 2000 , or to beat i.b.m. -- but they did n't have anything to do with customers . the new c.e.o. dec was acquired in june 1998 by compaq , in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry . at the time , compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors . dec was a major player overseas where compaq had less presence . however , compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions , and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own .
in june 2012 , following a series of public comments opposing same-sex marriage by dan t. cathy , chick-fil-a 's chief operating officer , related issues have arisen between the international fast food restaurant and lgbt people . this followed reports that chick-fil-a 's charitable endeavor , the s. truett cathy-operated winshape foundation , had donated millions of dollars to organizations seen by lgbt activists as hostile to lgbt rights . activists called for protests and boycotts , while supporters of the restaurant chain , and opponents of same-sex marriage ate there in support of the restaurant . national political figures both for and against the actions spoke out and some business partners severed ties with the chain . after the publication of cathy 's interviews , democrat thomas menino , the mayor of boston , stated that he would not allow the company to open franchises in the city `` unless they open up their policies . '' menino subsequently wrote a letter to dan cathy , citing cathy 's earlier statement on the ken coleman show , and responded : `` we are indeed full of pride for our support of same sex marriage and our work to expand freedom for all people . '' former arkansas governor and fox news commentator mike huckabee claimed on september 21 , 2012 that he had `` talked earlier today personally with dan cathy , ceo of chick-fil-a about the new reports that chick-fil-a had capitulated to demands of the supporters of same sex marriage . this is not true . the company continues to focus on the fair treatment of all of its customers and employees , but to end confusion gave me this statement . '' the statement provided by chick-fil-a was posted on huckabee 's website but the company did not respond to requests for comment .
on march 29 , 2005 , chisholm released her first solo album , expectancy , on the entheos records label . on this album she teamed up with songwriter/producer carnell murrell , autun foster , and doreonne stramler . recorded live at the cathedral center in detroit , the album 's background vocals were supplied by a special assembly of vocalists , which included two of her children , angel and aaron chisholm , as well as lorenzo clark , her sister denise clark-bradford 's son . the choir was directed by bryon stanfield . gmail recognizes messages related by subject and groups them into `` conversations '' where messages in a back-and-forth string get collected together and appear stacked one after another , with the newest messages at the top . any duplicated text is automatically concealed . the number of messages in a conversation always appears in parentheses next to the names of people in the conversation . a conversation will break off into a new thread if the subject line of a message is changed , or if the conversation reaches over 100 messages . around 11:00 pm est march 31 , 2008 , on the newer and older version of gmail , but not in the basic html version , in the upper right corner , next to settings , a link appeared labeled , `` new ! gmail custom time '' . the link led to a 404 error until april 1 , when it led to the full gmail custom time hoax page . clicking any of the three links at the bottom of the page brought the user to a page stating that gmail custom time was , in fact , their april fool 's day joke .
last friday , north korea conducted a successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that appears capable of reaching american cities , including seattle , los angeles and chicago . this new development is a cause for concern , but not panic or rash aggressive action . the greater danger faced by both the us and the region is the reaction of president donald trump to this development . the existence of a nuclear power with the capability of striking the united states is an inherent threat , but it is one that the us has lived with for decades . the trump administration has said it 's ready to unleash american military might to back its diplomacy when it comes to preventing north korea from developing a nuclear missile capable of hitting the united states . but there is no easy military solution to the crisis and several of the options potentially under consideration could risk thousands of lives . us officials told cnn last month that revised military options for north korea have been prepared and were ready to be presented to president donald trump . `` what we have to do is prepare all options because the president has made clear to us that he will not accept a nuclear power in north korea and a threat that can target the united states and target the american population , '' national security adviser h.r. north korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile friday that appears to have the range to hit major us cities , experts say , and prompted a fresh round of condemnation from the united states , china , japan and south korea . a combination of us , south korean and japanese analyses of the launch from mupyong-ni , near north korea 's border with china , shows the missile flew about 45 minutes , going 3,700 kilometers -lrb- 2,300 miles -rrb- high and for a distance of 1,000 kilometers -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- . if the missile were fired on a flatter , standard trajectory , it would have major us cities such as los angeles , denver and chicago well within its range , with the possible ability to reach as far as new york and boston , according to david wright , a missile expert at the union of concerned scientists . however , early analysis of friday 's test can not determine how heavy a payload the missile was carrying in its warhead , wright said .
behind his initially cheerful facade , darius is a psychopath who tampers with the mail of the people on his route , rewriting letters and smashing packages , among other acts of vandalism . aiding darius is daniel everson , a teenage delinquent who had become disillusioned after discovering that his older sister , beth , and his best friend , jay , are dating , and after being informed by darius that he is adopted . unbeknownst to daniel however , darius is a serial killer who has begun murdering those who become suspicious of him , such as a gas meter man , and daniel 's girlfriend , veronica . the more aggressive chrome followed in 1993 , produced by gil norton . with this album , the band began to shed its original shoegazing tag , while still making skillful use of atmospherics , such as on the song `` fripp '' . in a 2007 interview , rob dickinson said that members of death cab for cutie and interpol told him that without this album , their bands `` would n't exist . '' dread central 's mike phalin gave the film a 1 1/2 out of 5 , and wrote , `` the mailman just never gets to any sort of peak or level that draws in the viewer '' and `` with so much potential to be a deep thriller about family ties and morals , it is hard to believe the mailman ends up being just another one of those cheap films that goes nowhere and does nothing '' . a 2/5 was awarded by richard scheib of moria , who noted that while the mailman was bogged down by its low-budget , sub-par cinematography , and melodramatic direction , it was still `` a wonderfully sordid little film '' with memorable performances by bryan w. lukasik , ari tinnen , and rob arbogast .
snooker -lrb- pronounced uk : , us : -rrb- is a cue sport that originated among british army officers stationed in india in the second half of the 19th century . it is played on a rectangular table covered with a green cloth -lrb- or `` baize '' -rrb- , with pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each long side . using a cue stick and 21 coloured balls , players must strike the white ball -lrb- or `` cue ball '' -rrb- to pot or pocket the remaining balls in the correct sequence , accumulating points for each pot . an individual game -lrb- or frame -rrb- , is won by the player scoring the most points . the north atlantic treaty , also referred to as the washington treaty , is the treaty that forms the legal basis of , and is implemented by , the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- . the treaty was signed in washington , d.c. on 4 april 1949 . frank joseph whaley -lrb- born july 20 , 1963 -rrb- is an american actor , film director , screenwriter and comedian . his roles include brett in pulp fiction , robbie krieger in the doors , young archie `` moonlight '' graham in field of dreams , and guy in swimming with sharks . he also appeared in films like the freshman , a midnight clear , swing kids , broken arrow , and world trade center .
tarantino discovered the centerpiece for the work in 2009 while filming a movie with an actor that had the same stunt double for 20 years . even though there was nothing but a small bit for the stuntman to do , tarantino was asked to use him , and he agreed . the relationship fascinated tarantino and inspired him to make a film about hollywood . tarantino said that while the stuntman may have been a perfect double for the actor years earlier , at the time he had come to meet them , `` this was maybe the last or second-to-last thing they 'd be doing together '' . sylvester stallone does n't get back in the ring in `` creed , '' but he still comes away as a big winner in this far-fetched but likeable offshoot of the geriatric `` rocky '' series , as he may be more appealing playing the aging rocky balboa than he 's been since the beginning of his 40-year career . essentially taking on the role of burgess meredith 's old trainer mickey character from the series ' early days , the veteran actor delightfully registers as a paisano from the old neighborhood , a man of the streets who 's lived his life , fought his battles and has no more scores to settle . from the points of view of director-co-writer ryan coogler and star michael b. jordan , this marks some major mainstreaming after their bracing 2013 breakthrough with `` fruitvale station '' ; dramatically , it 's the same old `` rocky '' formula applied now to the hitherto unknown son of the late apollo creed . it worked before and , commercially , looks to work again . each year , i and several other hollywood reporter editors put together the roundtables that are a defining element of this publication 's awards coverage through the emmy and oscar seasons . for those not fully versed in the arcana of hollywood , the awards work like this : people produce a vast amount of film and television , some of it awful , some exceptional , and a whole lot in between . getting a shiny statuette -lrb- either an oscar or emmy -rrb- tells the world which side of the spectrum they fall on ; this is the ultimate validation that sets a winner apart from the pack . one award can change the trajectory of a whole career , save a network , and even resuscitate the fortunes of an ailing executive .
lennon remains friends with his father 's former bandmate , paul mccartney , though they experienced a public falling out in 2011 when lennon was not invited to mccartney 's wedding to nancy shevell . along with his estrangement from mccartney , lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with him and kept an ear on his music . during his career break from 1975 until shortly before his death , according to fred seaman , lennon and ono 's assistant at the time , lennon was content to sit back as long as mccartney was producing what lennon saw as mediocre material . lennon took notice when mccartney released `` coming up '' in 1980 , which was the year lennon returned to the studio . `` it 's driving me crackers ! '' while in new york , former beatles john lennon and george harrison had a short jam session , during which lennon asked harrison to perform on lennon 's next album . recording was scheduled to begin in a week 's time at lennon 's ascot sound studios , at his tittenhurst park residence . harrison agreed , and called his friend the bassist klaus voormann , to ask him to join in .
some republican politicians may be abandoning donald trump over his derogatory and vulgar comments about women , but he still has a friend in uk politician nigel farage . the brexit campaign leader came out swinging for the republican presidential nominee after sunday night 's debate in st. louis , telling multiple outlets that trump looked like a `` silverback gorilla '' who `` dominated '' opponent hillary clinton . buzzfeed 's ben smith caught up with farage in the post-debate spin room and asked the former british politician to expand on his comparison . `` he looked like a big gorilla prowling the set . it 's almost time for round two of the official presidential debates . here 's how to watch it on cnn . hillary clinton and donald trump will take the stage for the second of three presidential debates , on sunday at 9:00 p.m. et . mike pence gave a full-throated endorsement of his embattled running mate monday afternoon , the first time he has publicly addressed donald trump 's crude remarks caught on tape in 2005 since they were released three days ago . `` you saw that on the stage last night . you know , it takes a big man to know when he is wrong and to admit it and to have the humility to apologize and be transparent and be vulnerable with people and donald trump last night showed that he is a big man , '' pence told a few hundred supporters during the mid-day campaign stop . the indiana governor cut right to the chase at the top of his speech , broaching the debate and trump 's apology simultaneously .

in los angeles , the studios and hollywood grew . before world war i , movies were made in several us cities , but filmmakers tended to gravitate towards southern california as the industry developed . they were attracted by the warm climate and reliable sunlight , which made it possible to film movies outdoors year-round and by the varied scenery that was available . there are several starting points for cinema -lrb- particularly american cinema -rrb- , but it was griffith 's controversial 1915 epic birth of a nation that pioneered the worldwide filming vocabulary that still dominates celluloid to this day . although decca would continue to keep picture budgets lean , it was favored by changing circumstances in the film business , as other studios let their contract actors go in the wake of the 1948 u.s. vs. paramount pictures , et al. decision . leading actors were increasingly free to work where and when they chose , and in 1950 mca agent lew wasserman made a deal with universal for his client james stewart that would change the rules of the business . wasserman 's deal gave stewart a share in the profits of three pictures in lieu of a large salary . hollywood is a neighborhood in the central region of los angeles , california , notable as the home of the u.s. film industry , including several of its historic studios . its name has come to be a shorthand reference for the industry and the people associated with it .
native americans , also known as american indians , indigenous americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the united states , except hawaii and territories of the united states . more than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the us , about half of which are associated with indian reservations . the term `` american indian '' excludes native hawaiians and some alaskan natives , while `` native americans '' -lrb- as defined by the us census -rrb- are american indians , plus alaska natives of all ethnicities . the us census does not include native hawaiians or chamorro , instead being included in the census grouping of `` native hawaiian and other pacific islander '' . the americas -lrb- also collectively called america ; french : amérique , dutch : amerika , spanish and portuguese : américa -rrb- comprise the totality of the continents of north and south america . together , they make up most of the land in earth 's western hemisphere and comprise the new world . along with their associated islands , they cover 8 % of earth 's total surface area and 28.4 % of its land area . the topography is dominated by the american cordillera , a long chain of mountains that runs the length of the west coast . the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical , geographical , and political context in which it is used . american is derived from america , a term originally denoting all of the new world -lrb- also called the americas -rrb- . in some expressions , it retains this pan-american sense , but its usage has evolved over time and , for various historical reasons , the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america . in modern english , american generally refers to persons or things related to the united states of america ; among native english speakers this usage is almost universal , with any other use of the term requiring specification .
archibald clark `` arch '' west -lrb- september 8 , 1914 -- september 20 , 2011 -rrb- was an american marketing executive credited with the development of doritos , a brand of seasoned tortilla chips . the successful snack food was marketed as an alternative to the more traditional potato chips . doritos are now frito-lay 's second best-selling item , bested only by lay 's potato chips . an estimated five billion dollars in doritos are sold every year worldwide . according to information resources international , in 1993 , doritos earned $ 1.2 billion in retail sales , one-third of the total frito-lay sales for the year . nevertheless , in the costliest redesign in frito-lay history , in 1994 the company spent $ 50 million to redesign doritos to make the chips 20 % larger , 15 % thinner , and rounded the edges of the chip . roger j. berdusco , the vice president of tortilla chip marketing , said a primary reason for the change was `` greater competition from restaurant-style tortilla chips , that are larger and more strongly seasoned '' . the design change was the result of a two-year market research study that involved 5,000 chip eaters . in 2007 , doritos ran a campaign called `` doritos x-13d flavor experiment '' where black , unidentified bags of doritos were on the market for consumers to identify and name the flavor . the only flavor identification on these chips was `` all american classic '' .
public broadcasting involves radio , television and other electronic-media outlets whose primary mission is public service . in many countries of the world , funding comes from governments , especially via annual fees charged on receivers . in the united states , public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources , but generally most of their financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and businesses -lrb- ranging from small shops to corporations -rrb- , along with audience contributions via pledge drives . the great majority operate as private not-for-profit corporations . itv has been attempting to significantly reduce its obligations to produce and broadcast unprofitable public service programming , citing the increased competition from digital and multichannel television . similarly , channel 4 has projected a £ 100m funding gap if it is to continue with public service broadcasting after digital switch-over . as of 2005 , ofcom had been consulting on what direction public service broadcasting should take in the future . the bbc , whose broadcasting in the uk is funded by a licence fee and does not sell advertising time , is most notable for being the first public service broadcaster in the uk . its first director general , lord reith introduced many of the concepts that would later define public service broadcasting in the uk when he adopted the mission to `` inform , educate and entertain '' .
after going 0-for-3 with a strikeout in the rockies ' 8-0 road loss to the los angeles dodgers on may 21 , 1993 -lrb- a rare start and , even more rare , only the fourth time all season he was in a game from the first pitch to the final out -rrb- , murphy did not play in the next 4 games . on the morning of may 27 , 1993 , while the rockies were in houston to begin a series with the astros , he suddenly announced his retirement from baseball at age 37 . he explained the rockies were needing to make a 25-man roster move and informed him ahead of time he was going to be released . the team gave him the chance to retire instead of being released , which he did . at the age of 30 , in 1905 , schweitzer answered the call of the society of the evangelist missions of paris , which was looking for a physician . however , the committee of this missionary society was not ready to accept his offer , considering his lutheran theology to be `` incorrect '' . he could easily have obtained a place in a german evangelical mission , but wished to follow the original call despite the doctrinal difficulties . amid a hail of protests from his friends , family and colleagues , he resigned his post and re-entered the university as a student in a three-year course towards the degree of doctorate in medicine , a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude . schweitzer was nonetheless still sometimes accused of being paternalistic , colonialist , and racist in his attitude towards africans , and in some ways his views did differ from that of many liberals and other critics of colonialism . for instance , he thought that gabonese independence came too early , without adequate education or accommodation to local circumstances . edgar berman quotes schweitzer as having said in 1960 , `` no society can go from the primeval directly to an industrial state without losing the leavening that time and an agricultural period allow . '' schweitzer believed dignity and respect must be extended to blacks , while also sometimes characterizing them as children .
in 2000 and again in 2004 , time magazine named george w. bush as its person of the year , a title awarded to someone who the editors believe `` has done the most to influence the events of the year '' . in may 2004 , gallup reported that 89 percent of the republican electorate approved of bush . however , the support waned due mostly to a minority of republicans ' frustration with him on issues of spending , illegal immigration , and middle eastern affairs . america 's top diplomat is trying to revive dormant peace talks between israelis and palestinians , a source told cnn on thursday . secretary of state john kerry presented palestinian president mahmoud abbas a formula designed to entice him to the negotiating table , a source familiar with kerry 's talks said . he also presented the ideas to an arab league committee . this would serve the purpose of giving abbas cover and encouraging him to accept . the israeli -- palestinian conflict , ongoing since the middle of the 20th century , continued under bush . after president clinton 's 2000 camp david summit had ended without an agreement , the second intifada had begun in september 2000 . while previous administrations had tried to act as a neutral authority between the israelis and palestinians , the bush administration placed the blame for the violence on the palestinians , angering arab states such as saudi arabia . however , bush 's support for a two-state solution helped smooth over a potential diplomatic split with the saudis .
in thailand there has been progress on sex education , with the boundaries being pushed forward with each revision of the curriculum . the first national policy on sexuality education in schools was announced in 1938 , but sex education was not taught in schools until 1978 . it was then called `` life and family studies '' , and its content consisted of issues related to the reproductive system and personal hygiene . the education curriculum has been revised several times , involving efforts from both government and non-government sectors , and sex education has been accepted as a problem solving tool for adolescent sexual reproduction and health issues . there was considerable opposition to the idea that children of all classes should receive basic education , all the initiatives such as industrial schools and sunday schools were initially a private or church initiative . with the great exhibition of 1851 , it became clear just how far behind the english education system had fallen . norwell high school is a public secondary school , accredited by the new england association of schools and colleges -lrb- neasc -rrb- . it is located in norwell , massachusetts . the school includes approximately 50 full-time teachers . its students consistently score above state and national averages on the sat and other standardized tests , and on average , 97 % of students from each graduating class at norwell high school continue on to post-secondary education .
outcault traveled to the 1904 st. louis world 's fair , selling licenses to up to 200 companies to use the buster brown characters to advertise their products . buster brown 's association with shoes began with john bush , a sales executive with the brown shoe company ; he persuaded his company to purchase rights to the buster brown name , and the brand was introduced to the public at the 1904 world 's fair . mid -1939 saw a complete revamp of bedfords , with only the hc van continuing in production . the new range consisted of the k -lrb- 30 -- 40 cwt -rrb- , ms and ml -lrb- 2 -- 3 ton -rrb- , os and ol -lrb- 3 -- 4 ton -rrb- , os/40 and ol/40 -lrb- 5 ton -rrb- series , and the ob bus . also on offer was a new 10 -- 12 cwt van , the jc , derived from the new j model vauxhall car . many of the trucks sold by bedford between june and september 1939 were requisitioned for military use on the outbreak of world war ii ; many were abandoned after the retreat from dunkirk , rendered useless to the enemy by removing the engine oil drain plug and running the engine . bedford used the griffin logo of vauxhall motors , derived from the heraldic crest of falkes de breauté , who was granted the manor of luton by king john . by marriage , he acquired property in london , known as fulk 's hall , which over time , came to be the locality of vauxhall , the original home of vauxhall motors . the griffin returned to luton in 1903 when vauxhall motors moved there . the bedford version of the logo differed from the vauxhall version in that the griffin did not hold a flag -- although later versions of the logo showed the griffin holding a flag carrying a letter `` b '' -lrb- for bedford -rrb- instead of a `` v '' .
president donald trump is cleaning house in the department of homeland security . homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen and secret service director randolph `` tex '' alles have been ousted , and at least two officials have been named as possibly heading out the door : us citizenship and immigration services director francis cissna and office of the general counsel 's john mitnick . `` there is a near-systematic purge happening at the nation 's second-largest national security agency , '' an official told cnn . at least some of the sudden personnel changes come at the urging of white house senior adviser stephen miller , who played a key role in nielsen 's ouster . president donald trump announced sunday that department of homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen would be leaving her role in the trump administration . the departure comes as department and immigration officials have claimed that an influx of migrants attempting to come in to the us has pushed their systems at a breaking point , leading trump to declare a national emergency and threaten to shut down the southern border earlier this month . while trump said customs and border protection commissioner kevin mcaleenan will fill nielsen 's role in an acting capacity , a number of names are being floated for the agency 's permanent replacement . though , as one white house official told cnn 's pamela brown , there 's also concern no one will want to serve as nielsen 's replacement . kirstjen nielsen , the secretary of homeland security who has become a face of president donald trump 's hardline immigration push , is leaving the administration , president donald trump announced on twitter sunday afternoon . `` secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen will be leaving her position , and i would like to thank her for her service , '' trump said on twitter . `` i am pleased to announce that kevin mcaleenan , the current u.s. customs and border protection commissioner , will become acting secretary for @dhsgov . i have confidence that kevin will do a great job !

after hearing some of her songs , davis thought keys had `` a very natural talent as a songwriter and a vocalist , sufficient to warrant a personal meeting ... one of those no-brainers -- her beauty is stunning , and all her talent as an arranger , a producer '' . regarding her first meeting with davis , keys said that she had `` never had anyone of his stature ask me how i saw myself , and what i wanted to do . '' davis had asked keys `` what the creative visions were that she had for herself . '' she came across then , from that very first meeting , the way she comes across today , which is really as a young renaissance woman of enormous musical talent , but really matured way beyond her young years . when i saw her sit down and play the piano and sing , it just took my breath ... everything about her was unique and special . ana , alicia 's longtime friend , returns from exile in europe and explains why she never told alicia she was leaving . at first alicia laughs as she tells of her apartment being ransacked by officials , but soon begins to sob as she describes being held captive , tortured and raped for having lived with a man labeled as a subversive , even though she had n't seen him in two years . she says that while she was held captive , she witnessed pregnant women leave to give birth but return without their babies , whom she believes were sold to rich couples .

television has played a major role in the history of the premier league . the league 's decision to assign broadcasting rights to bskyb in 1992 was at the time a radical decision , but one that has paid off . at the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the uk market , as was charging fans to watch live televised football . however , a combination of sky 's strategy , the quality of premier league football and the public 's appetite for the game has seen the value of the premier league 's tv rights soar . many leagues are composed of friends , family , co-workers , and even strangers that are in the fantasy league to prove who is the greatest `` couch coach '' . millions of dollars are won and lost each year in fantasy sports league betting . some leagues are managed by players in the leagues , while other leagues are run by independent businesses . though the traditional fame of the game was for respect and pride within groups , gambling has gained a more prominent role . some fantasy football leagues wager things other than money , such as the loser of the league fulfilling a punishment . for example , the last place finisher must get a tattoo , and that tattoo has to be of what the winner of the league wants . the only thing that the loser gets any say in is the location of the tattoo . the owners of the teams have to sign a contract before the season to agree to the punishment if they lose .

congress voted wednesday on a bipartisan basis to pass free-trade bills with colombia , panama and south korea . president barack obama , who dined thursday at a korean restaurant with south korean president lee myung-bak and is to welcome him thursday on a state visit to the white house , sent the trade deals to congress last week . the white house , republicans and big business groups have said the deals would create jobs in the united states . the deals could spur $ 13 billion annually in new exports and `` support tens of thousands of jobs , '' a senior administration official has said . representatives introduce a bill while the house is in session by placing it in the hopper on the clerk 's desk . it is assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage . drafting statutes requires `` great skill , knowledge , and experience '' and sometimes take a year or more . sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction . a bill which reaches the floor of the full house can be simple or complex and begins with an enacting formula such as `` be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled . '' consideration of a bill requires , itself , a rule which is a simple resolution specifying the particulars of debate -- time limits , possibility of further amendments , and such . each side has equal time and members can yield to other members who wish to speak . sometimes opponents seek to recommit a bill which means to change part of it .

members of the house intelligence committee 's russia investigation are gearing up for tuesday 's testimony from top white house adviser and president donald trump 's son-in-law jared kushner -- with plans to pry into his public statement . the intensity could vary starkly from kushner 's appearance before the senate 's russia investigators just a day earlier , with house democrats saying they plan to probe for holes in kushner 's 11-page public statement and also pry into his role . kushner 's testimony tuesday is behind closed doors . and , in a twist , house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes -- who temporarily stepped aside from running the house russia probe in april -- said he might show up to tuesday 's interview of kushner . jared kushner met thursday with sen. lindsey graham on capitol hill , though the south carolina republican said the two discussed immigration policy and not congressional investigations into russian interference in last year 's us presidential election . kushner is expected to appear before the senate intelligence committee monday in its ongoing russia investigation . his closed-door session with the committee will be with staff , sources say . it is not yet clear when he would meet with senators . the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee said sunday he did not believe no one told president donald trump about a meeting last year between top members of his campaign and a russian lawyer . virginia sen. mark warner said in an interview on cnn 's `` state of the union '' that he wanted to question everyone involved in the meeting as part of the committee 's investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election . `` whether we 'll be able to get the russian nationals to come over and testify is an open question , '' warner said . `` those people that our committee has jurisdiction over , the americans , i sure as heck want to talk to them .

morton asserts in the book that cruise is the `` de facto second-in-charge '' in the church of scientology . when asked by the associated press what evidence he had about this , morton stated `` scientology would be a shadow of what it is today if it had not been for the involvement of tom cruise . he has been the poster boy . more than that , he has been recruiting fellow celebrities - people like will smith , jada pinkett smith . the book has been criticized by representatives for both tom cruise and the church of scientology . in an interview with the daily mail , attorney bertram fields called the book a `` boring , poorly researched book by a man who never talked to anyone involved in tom cruise 's life or anyone close to him , '' and criticized what he believed to be morton 's lack of independent research for the work . fields said that cruise would not read the book , saying `` he has no intention of reading it . he 's very , very busy with a lot of things right now . '' eliot abelson said that the church had attempted to contact morton and give him a tour , but `` received nothing .

'' some have advanced the view that holt 's death was not accidental , but rather that he chose to end his own life . supporters of this theory claim that holt was depressed and mentally unstable , and killed himself because he thought his political career was in jeopardy . those who reject it point to his joie de vivre and commitment to his family , as well as the plans he had made for the coming year . the 1968 police report specifically ruled out suicide , as holt had followed `` an ordinary domestic pattern '' in the days before his disappearance , and suicides in front of witnesses were considered atypical . on his first visit to the u.s. , holt made what was widely viewed as a faux pas while delivering a ceremonial address at the white house . departing from his prepared remarks , he said : `` and so , sir , in the lonelier and perhaps even more disheartening moments which come to any national leader , i hope there will be a corner of your mind and heart which takes cheer from the fact that you have an admiring friend , a staunch friend that will be all the way with lbj . '' holt had meant it to be a `` light-hearted gesture of goodwill towards a generous host '' , referencing the slogan used in johnson 's 1964 presidential campaign . it was interpreted as such by his immediate audience , but once it was reported back in australia it came to be viewed as a `` foolish , sycophantic and dangerous statement '' that was indicative of australian subservience .

'' on 11 september 2003 , the israeli security cabinet decided to `` remove '' arafat . in a statement it said `` recent days ' events have proven again that yasser arafat is a complete obstacle to any process of reconciliation ... israel will act to remove this obstacle in the manner , at the time , and in the ways that will be decided on separately ... '' prime minister ariel sharon refused to give a timetable for his removal , because `` it depends on what happens on the ground , '' . sharon said : `` arafat is responsible for the killing of hundreds , if not thousands , of jews , ... the sword is hanging over his head , and this is a good thing .

hamilton 's endorsement of jefferson in the presidential election of 1800 -lrb- `` the election of 1800 '' -rrb- results in further animosity between hamilton and burr , who challenges hamilton to a duel via an exchange of letters -lrb- `` your obedient servant '' -rrb- . hamilton writes his last letter in a rush while eliza tells him to go back to bed -lrb- `` best of wives and best of women '' -rrb- . burr and hamilton travel to new jersey for the duel . during the duel , both burr and hamilton fire at each other after ten paces , with hamilton intentionally missing his shot . in time out new york , david cote wrote , `` i love hamilton . i love it like i love new york , or broadway when it gets it right . and this is so right ... a sublime conjunction of radio-ready hip-hop -lrb- as well as r&b , britpop and trad showstoppers -rrb- , under-dramatized american history and miranda 's uniquely personal focus as a first-generation puerto rican and inexhaustible wordsmith , hamilton hits multilevel culture buttons , hard ... the work 's human drama and novelistic density remain astonishing .

american ancestry refers to people in the united states who self-identify their ancestral origin or descent as `` american '' , rather than the more common officially recognized racial and ethnic groups that make up the bulk of the american people . the majority of these respondents are visibly white americans , who either simply use this response as a political statement or no longer self-identify with their original ethnic ancestral origins . the latter response is attributed to a multitude of or generational distance from ancestral lineages , and these tend be of english , scotch-irish , or other british ancestries , as demographers have observed that those ancestries tend to be seriously undercounted in u.s. census bureau american community survey ancestry self-reporting estimates . although u.s. census data indicates `` american ancestry '' is commonly self-reported in the deep south and upland south , the vast majority of americans and expatriates do not equate their nationality with ancestry , race or ethnicity , but with citizenship and allegiance . the chicago americans was an american soccer club based in chicago , illinois that was a member of the american soccer league . they only played a few games in their only season . during their time they were also known as chicago inter and chicago hercules . the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical , geographical , and political context in which it is used . american is derived from america , a term originally denoting all of the new world -lrb- also called the americas -rrb- . in some expressions , it retains this pan-american sense , but its usage has evolved over time and , for various historical reasons , the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america . in modern english , american generally refers to persons or things related to the united states of america ; among native english speakers this usage is almost universal , with any other use of the term requiring specification .

as reported in the new york times on april 1 , 2007 , dowd had come to feel a deep frustration with and great disappointment in george w. bush , whom he criticized for failing to call the nation together in a time of war , for ignoring the will of the american public with regard to the iraq war , his re-nomination of former un ambassador john bolton after his rejected confirmation and for failing to hold secretary of defense donald rumsfeld accountable for the abu ghraib scandal . according to democracy now ! , dowd claims to have undergone a change of heart regarding the iraq war , and adopted a position advocating a withdrawal from that country , after contemplating the likelihood of his own son 's deployment to the country , as well as after seeing bush refuse to meet with anti-war-mother cindy sheehan in the summer of 2005 , while he was entertaining lance armstrong at his ranch in crawford , texas ; president bush had previously met with cindy sheehan in june 2004 . dowd cited these incidents , as well as bush 's handling of the hurricane katrina disaster , as cause for this change . cindy lee miller sheehan -lrb- born july 10 , 1957 -rrb- is an american anti-war activist , whose son , u.s. army specialist casey sheehan , was killed by enemy action during the iraq war . she attracted national and international media attention in august 2005 for her extended antiwar protest at a makeshift camp outside president george w. bush 's texas ranch -- a stand that drew both passionate support and criticism . sheehan ran unsuccessfully for congress in 2008 . she was a vocal critic of president barack obama 's foreign policy . cindy sheehan said that she initially questioned the urgency of the invasion of iraq but did not become active in the antiwar effort until after her son 's death . sheehan and other military families met with united states president george w. bush in june 2004 at fort lewis , near tacoma , washington , about three months after her son 's death . in a june 24 , 2004 , interview with the vacaville reporter , published soon after the meeting , she stated , `` we have n't been happy with the way the war has been handled . the president has changed his reasons for being over there every time a reason is proven false or an objective reached .

the museum of costume art was founded by aline bernstein and irene lewisohn . in 1946 , with the financial support of the fashion industry , the museum of costume art merged with the metropolitan museum of art as the costume institute , and in 1959 became a curatorial department . today , its collection contains more than 35,000 costumes and accessories . the costume institute used to have a permanent gallery space in what was known as the `` basement '' area of the met because it was downstairs at the bottom of the met facility . the question of the place of the art museum in its community has long been under debate . some see art museums as fundamentally elitist institutions , while others see them as institutions with the potential for societal education and uplift . john cotton dana , an american librarian and museum director , as well as the founder of the newark museum , saw the traditional art museum as a useless public institution , one that focused more on fashion and conformity rather than education and uplift . indeed , dana 's ideal museum would be one best suited for active and vigorous use by the average citizen , located near the center of their daily movement . on 10 march 1526 , charles and isabella met at the alcázar palace in seville . the marriage was originally a political arrangement , but on their first meeting , the couple fell deeply in love : isabella captivated the emperor with her beauty and charm . they were married that very same night in a quiet ceremony in the hall of ambassadors , just after midnight . following their wedding , charles and isabella spent a long and happy honeymoon at the alhambra in granada .
in 1971 , the cost of running for congress in utah was $ 70,000 but costs have climbed . the biggest expense is television advertisements . today 's races cost more than a million dollars for a house seat , and six million or more for a senate seat . since fundraising is vital , `` members of congress are forced to spend ever-increasing hours raising money for their re-election . '' congress gave final approval friday to a giant transportation funding bill as part of a package that includes a measure holding down interest rates on federal student loans . both issues are priorities of president barack obama 's , and the legislation demonstrated rare bipartisan agreement in the deeply divided congress . the package won senate approval with a 74-19 vote after passing the house 373-52 . hours later , president barack obama signed into a law a bill that temporarily -- from june 30 through july 6 -- assures there will be continued funding for certain transportation projects and halts potential student loan interest rate hikes , according to a news release issued by the white house shortly after 8 p.m. friday . after months of difficult talks , bipartisan house and senate negotiators reached a tentative deal on a giant transportation funding bill wednesday , multiple sources tell cnn . a formal announcement is expected late wednesday night after the last details are hammered out and the final language is drafted , they said . congressional leaders said they hoped to attach the $ 109 billion highway bill to a measure extending a rate cut on some student loans and legislation reauthorizing national flood insurance and pass them as one bill out of the house and senate by friday . doing so would let congress beat looming deadlines when these measures expire and also would allow lawmakers to escape town for their fourth of july recess .
hellbent on besting barack obama at everything , donald trump began talking about his potential nobel peace prize long before the date set for his summit with north korean leader kim jong un . he heaped praise on the most repressive leader in the world -- `` very honorable '' were the words he used -- and the white house military office even issued a commemorative medal for the upcoming summit which , bizarrely , called kim `` supreme leader . '' but thursday , with a letter to kim that is true to the cartoon nature of his personality , trump cites `` the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement '' and canceled the peace talks in a fit of childish pique . this came after vice president mike pence 's threat that the north korean government could be toppled as libya 's was if kim did n't come to heel -- a threat that prompted a north korean official to call pence a `` political dummy . '' a north korean official has lashed out at us vice president mike pence and said pyongyang is ready for a nuclear showdown if dialogue with the united states fails . choe son hui , a vice-minister in the north korean foreign ministry , said if the us continued on its current path , she would suggest to north korea 's leadership that they reconsider the planned summit between president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un . `` whether the us will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision and behavior of the united states , '' choe said in comments carried by north korea 's state-run kcna news agency thursday . choe was responding to comments by pence made monday during a fox news interview that she deemed `` unbridled and impudent . '' north korea says kim jong un is still willing to meet donald trump `` at any time , '' despite the us president 's abrupt cancellation of what would have been a historic summit between the two leaders , scheduled for june 12 . kim kye gwan , a top official at north korea 's foreign ministry , said trump 's decision to cancel the talks ran counter to the global community 's wishes for peace on the korean peninsula . `` we would like to make known to the us side once again that we have the intent to sit with the us side to solve problem -lrb- s -rrb- regardless of ways at any time , '' said kim in comments published friday by the country 's state-run news agency kcna . kim said president trump 's decision is `` not consistent with the desire of humankind for peace and stability in the world , to say nothing of those in the korean peninsula . ''
on september 21 , 1996 , clinton signed into law the defense of marriage act -lrb- doma -rrb- , which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman ; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states . paul yandura , speaking for the white house gay and lesbian liaison office , said clinton 's signing doma `` was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election '' . in defense of his actions , clinton has said that doma was intended to `` head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states '' , a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a `` very reactionary congress '' . administration spokesman richard socarides said , `` the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse , and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected . '' after the iraq war began , clinton made trips to iraq and afghanistan to visit american troops stationed there . on a visit to iraq in february 2005 , clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well . observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces , she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular u.s. army by 80,000 soldiers to ease the strain . in late 2005 , clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from iraq would be a mistake , bush 's pledge to stay `` until the job is done '' was also misguided , as it gave iraqis `` an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves '' . under the constitution , the vice president serves as president of the senate . he or she may vote in the senate -lrb- ex officio , for he or she is not an elected member of the senate -rrb- in the case of a tie , but is not required to . for much of the nation 's history the task of presiding over senate sessions was one of the vice president 's principal duties -lrb- the other being to receive from the states the tally of electoral ballots cast for president and vice president and to open the certificates `` in the presence of the senate and house of representatives '' , so that the total votes could be counted -rrb- . since the 1950s , vice presidents have presided over few senate debates .
after the collapse of socialist federal republic of yugoslavia , economic policies changed , and the jesenice ironworks could not compete with the better developed western metallurgy . another problem was the loss of access to raw material resources , which are located in the other , now separately independent republics of what had been yugoslavia . this led to massive layoffs , and the emigration of people in search of new jobs . in the years since the declaration of slovenian independence in 1991 , jesenice has become much less dependent on its metallurgic industry , and has started to develop other aspects of its economy . acronis international gmbh , simply referred to as acronis , is a global technology company with corporate headquarters in schaffhausen , switzerland and international headquarters in singapore . acronis develops on-premises and cloud software for backup , disaster recovery , and secure file sync and share and data access . acronis has 18 offices worldwide . its r&d centers , acronis labs , are based in the united states and singapore . in may 2013 , co-founder and board director , serguei beloussov , returned as ceo after working on other ventures . in december that same year , acronis announced the launch of an official research and development wing , acronis labs .
kunlunquan -lrb- 昆仑拳 , kunlun fist -rrb- is a style of chinese martial arts popular in the province of guangdong . as it is practiced by the minority hakka it is considered a kejiaquan . it was officially included among the styles nanquan , but originated in northern china . it was handed down in 1880 by huang huilong -lrb- 黄辉龙 -rrb- or feilong huang -lrb- 黄飞龙 -rrb- , a native of jinan in the province of shandong . chiang apologised to the japanese on 10 may and removed he yaozu from his post . after the incident , chiang decided he would write one `` way to kill the japanese '' each day in his journal , and also wrote that he now thought the japanese were china 's greatest enemy . justifying his backing down from conflict in jinan , he added that `` before one can settle scores , one must be strong '' . when chiang lectured a group of chinese army cadets on the subject , he urged them to turn their energies to washing away the shame of jinan , but to conceal their hatred until the last moment . by april 1928 , chiang kai-shek had once again consolidated power , at which time he resumed the northern expedition . the nra was able to quickly push back the forces of beiyang-aligned warlord sun chuanfang , and advanced into shandong . sun retreated to jinan by railway on 17 -- 18 april , leaving the path to jinan open to the nra . when the japanese learned of sun 's failure to defend shandong , prime minister tanaka , on the counsel of his military advisors , decided to deploy the 6th division to jinan on 19 april , in what was called the `` second shandong expedition '' -lrb- 第二山東出兵 , dai-ni santō shuppei -rrb- .
trevor stares into a mirror at home , repeating the words , `` i know who you are . '' it is revealed that one year prior , trevor ran over and killed a boy identical to nicholas after taking his eyes off the road to use the car 's cigarette lighter , which was witnessed by the boy 's mother , identical to maria . he decided to drive away , and the resulting guilt became the deep-seated cause of his insomnia , emaciation and repressed memory . ivan was a figment of trevor 's imagination and a manifestation of himself before the accident . roger ebert gave the film three stars out of four and stated in his review for the film : `` the director brad anderson , working from a screenplay by scott kosar , wants to convey a state of mind , and he and bale do that with disturbing effectiveness . the photography by xavi gimenez and charlie jiminez is cold slates , blues and grays , the palate of despair . we see trevor 's world so clearly through his eyes that only gradually does it occur to us that every life is seen through a filter . we get up in the morning in possession of certain assumptions through which all of our experiences must filter . brad anderson is best known for creating the comic strip marmaduke in 1954 , which he continued to draw until his death . according to anderson , `` during the time , i was drawing various types of dogs in my magazine cartoons , i was also trying to develop a dog character specifically for eventual newspaper syndication you could n't see the eyes of my shaggy dogs , so as i thought more about it i decided i wanted a dog where i could have an expressive face '' . anderson , who said that he drew on laurel and hardy routines for his ideas , received the national cartoonists society newspaper panel cartoon award for marmaduke in 1978 .
prior to location filming on the third and final series of father ted , morgan underwent a mandatory medical examination in which he was found to have high blood pressure and was prescribed medication . the day after recording the series ' final episode , morgan suffered a heart attack while hosting a dinner party at his home in south-west london . he was rushed to hospital , but died soon afterwards . his sister denise said , `` he was n't feeling great at the end of the meal and i went to the bedroom with him . morgan said in an interview with gay byrne on the late late show in 1996 that he was writing a screenplay entitled miracle of the magyars , based on a real-life incident in the 1950s when the archbishop of dublin forbade catholics from attending a football match between the republic of ireland and yugoslavia on religious and spiritual grounds . yugoslavia won the match 4 -- 1 . morgan planned to use hungary as the opposing side to ireland -- hence the title . at the time of his death in 1998 , he had completed the screenplay but the film was never made . the tested episodes always open with a quick montage of a newspaper personals section ad under `` red shoes '' seeking women to mail in their personal diaries with stories of love , passion and/or betrayal . the presenter and host jake winters -lrb- david duchovny -rrb- is then shown walking on desolate train tracks with his dog stella . he begins reading a letter from his post office box out loud that begins with `` dear red shoes ...

mike huckabee has a counter offer to jeb bush 's promise to bring the economy back to 4 % growth : 6 % . `` i believe we can get it to 6 or higher with a fair tax . i 'm convinced , '' huckabee told a crowd of potential caucus-goers at the iowa state fair on thursday . `` i guarantee you we will goose the economy if you bring $ 11 trillion of working capital back to this country . '' mike huckabee is the former governor of arkansas -lrb- 1996 -- 2007 -rrb- and was an unsuccessful candidate for the republican party nomination for president of the united states in the 2008 presidential election . he was running for the republican party nomination for president of the united states in the 2016 presidential election but suspended his campaign on february 1 , 2016 less than 12 hours after stepping off the debate stage in cleveland , chris christie arrived here friday to make a pitch to 900 conservative activists that he has the mettle to be the next commander-in-chief . his appearance was risky but strategic as the new jersey governor is not necessarily beloved by this audience -- many of whom question if he is a true conservative . the night before , at the red state debate watch party , the audience booed christie several times when he appeared on the large screens in a hotel ballroom . red state attendees tend to be more politically aligned with the likes of texas sen. ted cruz and wisconsin gov.
the convention was scheduled to be held on june 14 but was then moved to july 12 . republican leaders , including governor terry branstad and u.s. senator chuck grassley , as well as four of the candidates for the nomination , criticized the move . candidates sam clovis , joni ernst , matthew whitaker and david young signed a letter to the republican party of iowa asking them to move the convention date back , saying that `` essentially gifting braley an additional 30 days to campaign in a vacuum , while reducing our nominee 's time to raise funds and campaign as the general election candidate by an entire month -- only serves to strengthen braley 's viability '' . braley won an open seat battle in the 1st district after eight-term republican congressman jim nussle stepped down to make an unsuccessful run for governor in 2006 . the 1st district had been in republican hands since 1979 . however , eastern iowa has swung heavily democratic since the 1990s . the district has supported the democratic candidate for president in every election since 1988 . bruce lowell braley -lrb- born october 30 , 1957 -rrb- is a retired american politician and attorney who served as the u.s. representative for iowa 's 1st congressional district from 2007 to 2015 . a member of the democratic party , he was defeated in his attempt to win an open seat in the 2014 united states senate election in iowa .
on july 21 , 2017 , spicer announced his intention to resign as white house press secretary . he made his decision known immediately after president trump appointed financier anthony scaramucci as white house communications director . in the weeks leading up to the resignation announcement , spicer had sought `` a more strategic communications role '' in the white house . trump had reportedly been dissatisfied for some time with spicer 's performance as white house press secretary . the white house office of the press secretary deals with the daily press needs of the president and manages their relationship with the news media . the office of the press secretary deals with the president their relationship while the office of communications deals with strategic planning of how the president 's statements will be released to the public . the leader of this office must be stable and usually serves for a relatively long amount of time . in the 89 years that the press secretary has been a job , only 31 people have held the position . the white house press secretary is a senior white house official whose primary responsibility is to act as spokesperson for the executive branch of the united states government administration , especially with regard to the president , senior aides and executives , as well as government policies . the press secretary is responsible for collecting information about actions and events within the president 's administration and issues the administration 's reactions to developments around the world . the press secretary interacts with the media , and deals with the white house press corps on a daily basis , generally in a daily press briefing . the press secretary serves by the appointment and at the pleasure of the president of the united states ; the office does not require the advice and consent of the u.s. senate , though because of the frequent briefings given to the media , who in turn inform the public , the position is still a very prominent non-cabinet post .
due to the length of time between the series ' run on nickelodeon and its beginning on abc , there were several creative changes . billy west was replaced by tom mchugh as the voice of doug , while the role of roger was taken over by chris phillips . disney could not afford west , as his fame had grown from voicing characters in ren & stimpy and other animated properties . jinkins argues that he worked hard to keep west on the series , claiming that the deal the company offered him was breaking their budget . following his unsuccessful mayoral candidacy , there was speculation that ford would become a candidate for the leadership of the progressive conservative party of ontario . ford told reporters : `` it 's on the table , i would really consider it '' , and added : `` our campaign is ready to go . our people are itching to get involved . we are miles ahead of the other candidates . '' an early influence on douglas clifford 's playing was the beatles , with their appearance on the ed sullivan show in february 1964 being of particular significance . `` they were a quartet and we said , wow , we can do that . if these guys from england can come out and play rock 'n' roll , we can do it . we bought beatle wigs .
in 2016 , both the democratic and republican conventions were held before the summer olympics instead of after , as was the case in 2008 and 2012 . one reason the republican party scheduled their convention in july was to help avoid a longer , drawn-out primary battle similar to what happened in 2012 , which left the party fractured heading into the general election and eventually led to mitt romney losing the election to barack obama . the democratic party then followed suit , scheduling their convention in philadelphia the week after the republicans ' convention , to provide a quicker response . on may 3 , republican national committee chairman reince priebus declared donald trump the presumptive nominee after texas senator ted cruz dropped out of the race . in tampa this week , it 's not just republicans in town for the convention . over the next few days , you 'll see a lot of democratic faces in florida , dogging and counter-pointing the gop 's every move . los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa , national co-chair for the obama campaign and chairmain for the democratic national convention next week in charlotte , is one of those democratic voices in tampa . he says his presence at the rnc is to remind voters what republicans said during the primary season . los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa is behind enemy lines tonight . the co-chair of the obama campaign and chairman of the democratic national convention is on hand at the republican national convention to rebut the message from the gop . he talks with john berman about his role at the convention in the midst of tropical storm isaac . villaraigosa says he 's in tampa to challenge the republican platform `` in a way that is respectful of the other party . '' `` we 're to compare and contrast , but we 're also here together , working together , to make sure that people are safe , '' he says .

the full name of the policy at the time was `` do n't ask , do n't tell , do n't pursue '' . the `` do n't ask '' provision mandated that military or appointed officials will not ask about or require members to reveal their sexual orientation . the `` do n't tell '' stated that a member may be discharged for claiming to be a homosexual or bisexual or making a statement indicating a tendency towards or intent to engage in homosexual activities . the `` do n't pursue '' established what was minimally required for an investigation to be initiated . the `` do n't ask '' part of the dadt policy specified that superiors should not initiate investigation of a service member 's orientation without witnessing disallowed behaviors , though credible evidence of homosexual behavior could be used to initiate an investigation . unauthorized investigations and harassment of suspected servicemen and women led to an expansion of the policy to `` do n't ask , do n't tell , do n't pursue , do n't harass '' . the do n't ask , do n't tell repeal act of 2010 -lrb- h.r. 2965 , s. 4023 -rrb- is a landmark united states federal statute enacted in december 2010 that established a process for ending the do n't ask , do n't tell -lrb- dadt -rrb- policy -lrb- 10 u.s.c. § 654 -rrb- , thus allowing gay , lesbian , and bisexual people to serve openly in the united states armed forces . it ended the policy in place since 1993 that allowed them to serve only if they kept their sexual orientation secret and the military did not learn of their sexual orientation , which was controversial .

'' however , hudson 's photographs had previously been exposed as fraudulent in 1872 . wallace 's 1904 book man 's place in the universe was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets . he concluded that the earth was the only planet in the solar system that could possibly support life , mainly because it was the only one in which water could exist in the liquid phase . more controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties -lrb- the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time -rrb- .

chiefs of tribal nations that once inhabited georgia say that the atlanta braves ' tomahawk chop is insensitive and inappropriate . the comments from cherokee and creek chiefs come after the atlanta braves said the team would hold a `` continued dialogue '' with native americans during the major league baseball offseason about whether to keep the decades-old tradition . the braves did not specify which tribal nations it planned to talk to . `` although the tomahawk chop may be a game day tradition , it is not an appropriate acknowledgment of tribal tradition or culture , '' muscogee -lrb- creek -rrb- nation principal chief james r. floyd said in a statement to cnn . president donald trump said again on friday that americans need identification to buy groceries , which remains not true . `` you know , if you want to go out and buy groceries , you need identification . if you want to do almost anything you need identification . the only thing you do n't need identification for is to vote , the most important single thing you 're doing -- to vote , '' trump said at a campaign rally in lake charles , louisiana . in the united states , an american indian tribe , native american tribe , alaska native village , tribal nation , or similar concept is any extant or historical clan , tribe , band , nation , or other group or community of native americans in the united states . modern forms of these entities are often associated with land or territory of an indian reservation . `` federally recognized indian tribe '' is a legal term of art in united states law with a specific meaning . an indian tribe recognized by the united states government usually possesses tribal sovereignty , a `` dependent sovereign nation '' status with the federal government that is similar to that of a state in some situations , and that of a nation in others .

'' boyce had eight weeks ' pre-production , but she said that she began putting stuff together early on . she stated `` after those eight weeks , we had 16 days to complete the next two episodes . since 2016 , there had been speculation on the possibility that the television series would be made into a feature film . in may 2016 , essie davis acknowledged interest in playing miss fisher in a film .

in 1925 , after years of bachelorhood , warner met eighteen-year-old ziegfeld follies performer and actress lina basquette while spending time in new york visiting the bell laboratories . the two began an intense love affair . on july 4 , 1925 , the two were married . while warner 's younger brother jack did not object to basquette 's catholicism , the rest of the warner family did . in the fall of 2012 , warner was approached by supporters about possibly leaving the senate to seek a second four-year term as virginia 's governor . after considering the prospect , warner announced shortly after the november 2012 elections that he had chosen to remain in the senate because he was `` all in '' on finding a bipartisan solution to the country 's fiscal challenges . samuel warner was the first member of his family to move into the entertainment industry . in the early 1900s , he formed a business partnership with another youngstown resident and `` took over '' the city 's old grand opera house , which he used as a venue for `` cheap vaudeville and photoplays '' . the venture failed after one summer . warner then secured a job as a projectionist at idora park , a local amusement park .
in december 2012 , following the shooting , nra broke its social media silence and media blackout to announce a press conference . at the event , lapierre announced an nra-backed effort to assess the feasibility of placing armed security officers in the nation 's 135,000 public and private schools under a `` national school shield program '' . he called on congress `` to act immediately to appropriate whatever is necessary '' . the announcement came in the same week after president obama had stated his support for a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines . inspired by john f. kennedy who profoundly declared , `` let us think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities , because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which , fulfilled , can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation '' , the student body of america association , a 501 -lrb- c -rrb- 3 nonprofit organization , has initiated its project pay it forward program to implement education with the pay-it-forward concept . the national office of the aclu was even more reluctant to defend anti-war protesters . a majority of the board passed a resolution in 1942 which declared the aclu unwilling to defend anyone who interfered with the united states ' war effort . included in this group were the thousands of nisei who renounced their us citizenship during the war but later regretted the decision and tried to revoke their applications for `` repatriation . '' -lrb- a significant number of those slated to `` go back '' to japan had never actually been to the country and were in fact being deported rather than repatriated . -rrb-
a large-sized college would be more efficient than the equivalent small colleges , the proposed colleges have to meet the additional requirements of the country as a whole and for that purpose should have to function on an all-india basis . therefore , the smaller they are in number and the larger in size , the better , and for the same reason their location is important from an all-india point of view . in the same year , a bill was introduced in the california legislature calling for the establishment of a publicly funded `` california institute of technology '' , with an initial budget of a million dollars , ten times the budget of throop at the time . the board of trustees offered to turn throop over to the state , but the presidents of stanford university and the university of california successfully lobbied to defeat the bill , which allowed throop to develop as the only scientific research-oriented education institute in southern california , public or private , until the onset of the world war ii necessitated the broader development of research-based science education . the promise of throop attracted physical chemist arthur amos noyes from mit to develop the institution and assist in establishing it as a center for science and technology . in 1961 the galcit acronym was retained while the name changed to graduate aeronautical laboratories at the california institute of technology . in 2006 , during the directorship of ares rosakis , galcit was once again renamed , taking on the new name graduate aerospace laboratories of the california institute of technology -lrb- while continuing to maintain the acronym galcit -rrb- in order to reflect its vigorous re-engagement with space engineering and with jpl .
sonia gandhi struggled to revive the party in her early years as its president ; she was under continuous scrutiny for her foreign birth and lack of political acumen . in the snap elections called by the national democratic alliance -lrb- nda -rrb- government in 1999 , congress ' tally further plummeted to just 114 seats . although the leadership structure was unaltered as the party campaigned strongly in the assembly elections that followed , gandhi began to make such strategic changes as abandoning the party 's 1998 pachmarhi resolution of ekla chalo , or `` go it alone '' policy , and formed alliances with other like-minded parties . in the intervening years , the party was successful at various legislative assembly elections ; at one point , congress ruled 15 states . representatives introduce a bill while the house is in session by placing it in the hopper on the clerk 's desk . it is assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage . drafting statutes requires `` great skill , knowledge , and experience '' and sometimes take a year or more . sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction . ideas for legislation can come from members , lobbyists , state legislatures , constituents , legislative counsel , or executive agencies . anyone can write a bill , but only members of congress may introduce bills . most bills are not written by congress members , but originate from the executive branch ; interest groups often draft bills as well . the usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review .
an editorial in the honolulu star-bulletin dismissed the claims about obama 's eligibility as proposing `` a vast conspiracy involving obama 's parents , state officials , the news media , the secret service , think-tanks and a host of yet-to-be-uncovered others who have connived since obama 's birth to build a false record so that he could eventually seek the presidency 47 years later . '' the st. petersburg times ' fact-checking website , politifact.com , concluded its series of articles on the birth certificate issue by saying : after president trump announced his withdrawal of the united states from the paris agreement on june 1 , obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice : `` but even in the absence of american leadership ; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future ; i 'm confident that our states , cities , and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way , and help protect for future generations the one planet we 've got . '' tracey mann , a candidate running for congress from kansas in 2010 , stated at a candidate forum that obama `` should show his birth certificate to really resolve this thing one way or another '' . in a radio interview , he answered a question as `` i think the president of the united states needs to come forth with his papers and show everyone that he 's an american citizen and put this issue to bed once and for all . '' in response , on july 21 , 2010 , the hutchinson news , a local paper in hutchinson , kansas , withdrew their endorsement of mann , saying that mann `` questions the citizenship of president barack obama despite evidence that is irrefutable to most objective , rational people -- including a birth certificate released by the hawaii secretary of state and birth announcements printed in honolulu 's two major newspapers '' . mann responded that he was `` disappointed and mystified by the hutchinson news ' decision to withdraw their endorsement over a misunderstanding of position '' , as he is not `` interested in pursuing this issue in congress '' , and he has `` never had any interest in spending any time on the matter '' .
when tent city was closed , home depot evicted the residents with private security guards and the support of the toronto police service . a formal property claim system was instituted where individuals were allowed to briefly return to the site to retrieve personal property before being permanently removed from the area . this action was criticized by activist groups as an attempt by home depot to clear land to develop a downtown big box outlet , however , the ontario municipal board had previously ruled that a store could not be built on the site . after the eviction , the city of toronto made shelter spaces available for each of the roughly 110 people removed . toronto , ontario , canada 's largest city , was also home to its own `` tent city '' until september 2002 , when the residents of tent city were evicted by the owner of the property , home depot . it was situated in the downtown core of toronto , near the waterfront , and was home to hundreds of people who were homeless . in the years since , the programs of travelers aid have continued to expand and offer various services . for the past 25 years , atlanta has been a popular destination for relocation east of the mississippi river , necessitating these continuing services . it is expected that nearly 75,000 people in georgia will be homeless at some point this year .
the netflix model has also affected viewers ' expectations . according to a 2013 nielsen survey , more than 60-percent of americans said that they binge-watch shows , and nearly 8 out of 10 americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule . netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once , acknowledging changing viewer habits . this allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time ; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace . netflix , inc. -lrb- -rrb- is an american media-services provider and production company headquartered in los gatos , california , founded in 1997 by reed hastings and marc randolph in scotts valley , california . the company 's primary business is its subscription-based streaming service which offers online streaming of a library of films and television programs , including those produced in-house . as of april 2019 , netflix had over 148 million paid subscriptions worldwide , including 60 million in the united states , and over 154 million subscriptions total including free trials . it is available worldwide except in mainland china -lrb- due to local restrictions -rrb- , syria , north korea , and crimea -lrb- due to us sanctions -rrb- . netflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures . in september 2002 , the new york times reported that , at the time , netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers . the company 's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006 , to 14 million in march 2010 . netflix 's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of dvd players in households ; in 2004 , nearly two-thirds of united states homes had a dvd player .
donald trump 's weekend of assaults on robert mueller 's investigation pushed washington closer than ever to the major crisis of governance that could ensue if the president were to act on his fury and fire the special counsel . the president 's lambasting of the russia probe and the administration 's sacking of former fbi deputy director andrew mccabe prompted warnings from key republicans that he would send the country over a cliff if he tried to dismiss mueller . and the white house will monday face uncomfortable new questions about the trump team 's conduct during the 2016 election after facebook suspended cambridge analytica , a data firm used by president 's campaign , over allegations it used the data of 50 million users of the social media site without their permission . trump 's major agenda push this week will highlight his plan to tackle the opioid crisis . in february 2017 , it was reported that white house officials had asked the fbi to issue a statement that there had been no contact between trump associates and russian intelligence sources during the 2016 campaign . the fbi did not make the requested statement , and observers noted that the request violated established procedures about contact between the white house and the fbi regarding pending investigations . after comey revealed in march that the fbi was investigating the possibility of collusion between the trump campaign and russia , trump phoned coats and director of national security admiral michael s. rogers and asked them to publicly state there was no evidence of collusion between his campaign and the russians . both coats and rogers believed that the request was inappropriate , though not illegal , and did not make the requested statement . the report writes that the investigation `` identified numerous links between the russian government and the trump campaign '' , found that russia `` perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency '' and that the 2016 trump presidential campaign `` expected it would benefit electorally '' from russian hacking efforts . however , ultimately `` the investigation did not establish that members of the trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the russian government in its election interference activities '' . the evidence was not necessarily complete due to encrypted , deleted , or unsaved communications as well as false , incomplete , or declined testimony .

once the money was in hand , eight years of congressional haggling ensued over how to interpret smithson 's rather vague mandate `` for the increase and diffusion of knowledge '' . unfortunately , the money was invested by the us treasury in bonds issued by the state of arkansas , which soon defaulted . after heated debate , massachusetts representative -lrb- and former president -rrb- john quincy adams persuaded congress to restore the lost funds with interest and , despite designs on the money for other purposes , convinced his colleagues to preserve it for an institution of science and learning . finally , on august 10 , 1846 , president james k. polk signed the legislation that established the smithsonian institution as a trust instrumentality of the united states , to be administered by a board of regents and a secretary of the smithsonian . as approved by congress on august 10 , 1846 , the legislation that created the smithsonian institution called for the creation of a board of regents to govern and administer the organization . this 17-member board meets at least four times a year and includes as ex officio members the chief justice of the united states and the vice president of the united states . the nominal head of the institution is the chancellor , an office which has traditionally been held by the chief justice . in september 2007 , the board created the position of chair of the board of regents , a position currently held by david rubenstein . pilar o'leary launched the program when she served as executive director of the smithsonian latino center . according to the latino center , o'leary told the press in 2007 : `` our goal is to help our young ambassadors become the next generation of leaders in the arts and culture fields . this program encourages students to be proud of their roots and learn more about their cultural heritage to inspire them to educate the public in their own communities about how latinos are enriching america 's cultural fabric .

unilever certifies its tea products by the rainforest alliance scheme . the company has stated that at least 50 % of the tea in its products originates from certified farms , compared to the alliance 's 30 % minimum entry point . unilever decided on the scheme over fairtrade , because according to the company 's analysis , fairtrade might `` lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates '' . on 22 december 2014 , unilever announced the purchase of the camay brand globally and the zest brand outside of north america and the caribbean from procter & gamble . the sale is part of p&g 's strategy of shedding its 80-100 non-core brands and diverting focus to the remaining 70-90 powerhouse brands . the two brands had a combined revenues of $ 225 million in fiscal 2014 . the sale also includes p&g 's manufacturing facility in mexico.the plant employs approximately 170 people who will transfer to unilever at the completion of the deal . on 2 august 2016 , globes reported that the company has published more information about telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a telma announcement had been made : `` we again stress that all telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat . according to our company 's strict procedures , every production batch is checked and put on hold . these products are not marketed until test results for this product series are returned , confirming that all is well . if any flaw is discovered , the batch is not marketed to stores , as was the case .

i always thought of rambo when he was 16 or 17 -- i hope they can do the prequel -- he was the best person you could find . he was the captain of the team ; he was the most popular kid in school ; super athlete . he was like jim thorpe , and the war is what changed him . if you saw him before , he was like the perfect guy . gary glasberg wrote a letter to the fans , and started with `` that was quite a summer , i did not plan on the departure of ziva david '' . when it was announced , glasberg had to change the story and start `` making this work and handling the situation with the utmost care and delicacy '' . `` it 's okay to be sad . but , then , do n't forget what we 're good at '' , he continued . it starts in a rainstorm in the middle of a rescue : 3 missing hikers in danger of getting caught in a flood . the police say they have to stop the search as it 's getting too dangerous and ask where the volunteer on horseback is . we are then introduced to rambo in the woods tracking the hikers , he finds a girl dead then further down finds the other two . he 's trying to get them out but one guy wo n't leave without his wife .
public opinion polls have consistently shown that a majority of americans believe there was a conspiracy to kill kennedy . gallup polls have also found that only 20 -- 30 % of the population believe that oswald had acted alone . these polls also show that there is no agreement on who else may have been involved . former los angeles district attorney vincent bugliosi estimated that a total of 42 groups , 82 assassins , and 214 people had been accused in various kennedy assassination conspiracy theories . president johnson quickly issued an executive order to create the warren commission -- chaired by chief justice earl warren -- to investigate the assassination . the commission concluded that oswald acted alone in killing kennedy and that oswald was not part of any conspiracy . the results of this investigation are disputed by many . the assassination proved to be a pivotal moment in u.s. history because of its impact on the nation , and the ensuing political repercussions . president johnson created the warren commission -- chaired by chief justice earl warren -- to investigate the assassination . the warren commission concluded that oswald acted alone in killing kennedy , and that oswald was not part of any conspiracy . the results of this investigation are disputed by many . various theories place the blame for the assassination on cuba , the soviet union , the mafia , the cia , the fbi , top military leaders , or lyndon johnson .

in 1969 , don fisher , a california commercial real estate broker specializing in retail store location , was a social friend of walter `` wally '' haas jr , president of levi strauss & co. . fisher was inspired by the sudden success of ` the tower of shoes ' in an old quonset hut in a non-retail industrial area of sacramento , california. , that drew crowds by advertising that no matter what brand , style or size of shoes a woman could want it was at the tower of shoes . and knowing that even macy 's , the biggest levi 's customer , was constantly running out of the best selling levi 's sizes , and colors , fisher asked haas to let him copy the tower of shoes ' business model and apply it to levi 's products . haas referred fisher to bud robinson , his director of advertising , for what haas assumed would be a quick refusal ; but instead robinson and fisher carefully worked out a legal test plan for what was to become the gap -lrb- named by don 's wife doris fisher -rrb- . the gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened , with its name referring to the generation gap of the time . it originally sold everything that levi strauss & co made in every style , size , and color , and organized the stock by size . the gap was the first of many shops that carried only levi 's . in 1973 , gap started making their own jeans as a way to differentiate themselves from department stores . call it the american nightmare . most americans believe it 's more likely for people to fall out of the middle class than to climb into it , according to a macarthur foundation poll released tuesday . only 14 % said working class americans are more likely to scale the ladder into the middle class , while a large majority -- 79 % -- of respondents felt the opposite was true . related : to help the poor , the middle class will have to pay a key factor that 's led to this pessimistic view is the distrust of the housing market .
although mel gibson wanted to call his film the passion , on october 16 , 2003 , his spokesman announced that the title used in the united states would be the passion of christ because miramax films had already registered the title the passion with the mpaa for the 1987 novel by jeanette winterson . later , the title was changed again to the passion of the christ for all markets . i wanted it to be shocking ; and i wanted it to be extreme ... so that they see the enormity of that sacrifice ; to see that someone could endure that and still come back with love and forgiveness , even through extreme pain and suffering and ridicule . the actual crucifixion was more violent than what was shown on the film , but i thought no one would get anything out of it . after the initial run in movie theaters , i received numerous letters from people all across the country . many told me they wanted to share the experience with loved ones but were concerned that the harsher images of the film would be too intense for them to bear . in light of this i decided to re-edit the passion of the christ .
the world health report 2006 -lrb- whr2006 -rrb- highlighted the estimated shortage of almost 4.3 million doctors , nurses , midwives , and other health human resources worldwide , calling the situation a `` global health workforce crisis '' . the report laid out a ten-year action plan for building national health workforces through better training , recruitment and management processes . in 2016 , the world health organization drafted a global health sector strategy on hiv . in the draft , the world health organization outlines its commitment to ending the aids epidemic by the year 2030 with interim targets for the year 2020 . in order to make achievements towards these targets , the draft lists actions that countries and the who can take , such as a commitment to universal health coverage , medical accessibility , prevention and eradication of disease , and efforts to educate the public . some notable points made in the draft include addressing gender inequity where females are nearly twice as likely as men to get infected with hiv and tailoring resources to mobilized regions where the health system may be compromised due to natural disasters , etc. . in 2006 , world health day was devoted to the health workforce crisis , or chronic shortages of health workers around the world due to decades of underinvestment in their education , training , salaries , working environment and management . the day was also meant to celebrate individual health workers -- the people who provide health care to those who need it , in other words those at the heart of health systems .
the addition of `` gaming disorder '' to the icd-11 was criticized by gamers and the video game industry , while some researchers remained skeptical . some of these researchers said the evidence remains weak and `` there is a genuine risk of abuse of diagnoses . '' a group of 26 scholars wrote an open letter to the who , suggesting that the proposed diagnostic categories lacked scientific merit and were likely to do more harm than good . in counter-argument , a group of fifty academic researchers in behavioral science agreed that the evidence to support gaming disorder was weak , but it would be best that who identify gaming disorder in icd-11 so that it could be considered a clinical and public health need . common challenges involve the reliability of the methodology and validity of the results in some studies . many rely on self-surveys from university students and also lack time frames making it difficult to study the impact , if any , of addiction on a long term scale . other concerns also address the definition of addiction and how to measure it , questioning whether or not time is a proper unit to determine how addicted someone is to gaming . daria joanna kuss and mark d. griffiths have argued the current scientific knowledge on internet gaming addiction is copious in scope and complexity . the gambling research center aims at scientifically examining all topics relating to gaming and gambling from an interdisciplinary , in particular economic , mathematic , social , medical , psychological , and legal point of view . practice has shown that the individual disciplines come to different results as long as they do not relate their research findings . such conflicting assessments are being examined in the gambling research center .
in october 2002 , smart 's sister mary katherine suddenly realized that the abductor 's voice was that of an unemployed man the family knew as immanuel , whom the family had hired for a day to work on the roof and rake leaves . the book follows unemployed man , an out of work superhero and his sidekick plan b. unemployed man first began as the ultimatum , a rich superhero that looked down upon the poor and unemployed as lazy or otherwise unmotivated . he later loses his job and is defeated by the invisible hand , eventually ending up homeless . unemployed man must then seek a new job and team up with other superheroes in the same situation he is currently in . when gray joined semi-professional ball he changed his last name , as his older brother had done as a boxer . he did this to avoid ethnic prejudices from other players , coaches , fans , and front offices at the time . in 1942 he signed with the minor league team called the three rivers club of the canadian -- american league . at his first game the crowd poured out to see him .
the vermin only teaze and pinchtheir foes superior by an inch . so nat ` ralists observe , a fleahath smaller fleas that on him prey ; and these have smaller fleas to bite 'em . and so proceeds ad infinitum . thus every poet , in his kind , is bit by him that comes behind : people have known about parasites such as roundworms and tapeworms since ancient egypt , greece , and rome . in early modern times , antonie van leeuwenhoek observed giardia lamblia in his microscope in 1681 , while francesco redi described internal and external parasites including sheep liver fluke and ticks . modern parasitology developed in the 19th century . in human culture , parasitism has negative connotations . in the classical era , the concept of the parasite was not strictly pejorative : the parasitus was an accepted role in roman society , in which a person could live off the hospitality of others , in return for `` flattery , simple services , and a willingness to endure humiliation '' .
while touring alongside the killers in the united states with his band , stellastarr in 2004 , shawn christensen wrote a spec script called sidney hall with his best friend and roommate jason dolan , which he shared in increments with his friend , paul wesley . the inspiration for the screenplay was that christensen and dolan mused about the differences in life between the ages of eighteen and when they would turn thirty . they initially considered to make the titular character into an influential rock musician , but decided to go with the route of him being an author , when they realized the expectations of creating new music that could realistically be considered groundbreaking . wesley received the completed draft of the screenplay , which he described in an interview as , `` one of the most beautiful things ever read in life '' . in georgetown , in 1796 , the protestant episcopal inhabitants had inaugurated a movement resulting in the establishment of a church within the new parish , which was consecrated in 1809-so that , when the general government was removed from philadelphia , in 1800 , the newcomers found three places of worship for episcopalians within the district , two previously mentioned and the third being st. paul 's church in rock creek parish ; but all too far removed from the central and more populated portion of washington to be practically useful in those days of almost impassable roads . to supply this great need the residents in what was known as the first and second wards of washington-lying between georgetown and sixth street-in the year 1814 took decided measures to procure the erection of a church in the part of the city referred to . the persons who seem to have been most actively engaged in this work were thomas h gillis , james davidson , lund washington , peter hagner , john graham -lrb- diplomat -rrb- , john peter van ness , joshua dawson , william winston seaton , john tayloe iii , thomas munroe , james thompson , james h. blake , david easton , and joseph gales , jr. . in 1967 hall met john oates , who was also an undergraduate at temple university . according to daryl hall , they met when `` we got in the middle of a fight at a dance - i have no idea what the fight was about . i guess the greek letters on one gang 's jackets did n't appeal to the other gang . we both beat it out the back and met on the elevator while leaving the place rather quickly .

by 1926 , goodyear was the largest rubber company in the world . only four years earlier it was forced to temporarily halt production of racing tires due to heavy competition . nevertheless , the popularity of the goodyear tire on the racing circuit led to a popular demand for the return of the brand . in 2008 , goodyear won the all-america city award , sponsored by the national civic league . the city is named after the goodyear tire and rubber company . the company cultivated extensive farmland here to grow cotton for use in their tires . between the years 1831 and 1832 , goodyear heard about gum elastic -lrb- natural rubber -rrb- and examined every article that appeared in the newspapers relative to this new material . the roxbury rubber company , of boston , had been for some time experimenting with the gum , and believed it had found means for manufacturing goods from it . it had a large plant and was sending its goods all over the country . it was some of roxbury 's goods that first attracted goodyear 's attention .

when john brown sr. relinquished control of the university -lrb- at least in name , since he remained as chairman of the board -rrb- in 1948 , he began a period of much-needed consolidation . during world war ii the student body had dropped to barely over a hundred , and the high echelons of the school 's leadership were being run almost exclusively by the brown family . under the second brown , professors and administrators were hired who had more advanced degrees , the board of trustees began to develop as a more independent body , and the students elected representatives to an independent council . all of this was beginning to occur by the end of the 1940s . from 1990s , tmss has been succeeded by the tartu semiotics school , which is based in the department of semiotics of the university of tartu and led by kalevi kull , peeter torop , mihhail lotman , and others . the phrase `` semiotic anthropology '' was first used by milton singer -lrb- 1978 -rrb- . singer 's work brought together the semiotics of charles sanders peirce and roman jakobson with theoretical streams that had long been flowing in and around the university of chicago , where singer taught . in the late 1970s , michael silverstein , a young student of jakobson 's at harvard university , joined singer in chicago 's department of anthropology . since that time , anthropological work inspired by peirce 's semiotic have proliferated , in part as students of singer and silverstein have spread out across the country , developing semiotic-anthropological agendas of their own .
the grizzly bears of yellowstone national park will be spared from a proposed trophy hunt , thanks to a ruling by a federal judge . the ruling , filed monday , effectively places the greater yellowstone grizzly -- the grizzly population native to areas around the park -- back on the endangered species list , which means they will receive special protections . it will also spare the bears from a planned hunt in wyoming and idaho this fall . in the ruling , us district court judge dana christensen says the decision was not made with any kind of political stance in mind . in the early history of the park , visitors were allowed , and sometimes even encouraged , to feed the bears . visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with the bears , who had learned to beg for food . this led to numerous injuries to humans each year . in 1970 , park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears , and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas . black bears are common in the park and were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the bears starting in 1910 . feeding and close contact with bears has not been permitted since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods . yellowstone is one of the few places in the united states where black bears can be seen coexisting with grizzly bears . black bear observations occur most often in the park 's northern ranges and in the bechler area which is in the park 's southwestern corner .
trump 's comment sparked condemnation from various democrats and republicans for being perceived as suggesting violence against clinton or liberal jurists , instead of suggesting political action . clinton campaign spokesman robby mook released a statement that said , '' ... what trump is saying is dangerous '' , and that a person seeking the presidency `` should not suggest violence in any way . '' general michael hayden , who is the former head of the cia , stated that `` if someone else had said that outside the hall , he 'd be in the back of a police wagon now with the secret service questioning him . '' secret service spokesperson cathy milhoan said in a statement that the u.s. secret service was aware of trump 's comments . on september 22 , shortly after the public had become aware of the existence of a whistleblower , trump acknowledged that he had discussed joe biden during a call with zelensky on july 25 . trump said , `` the conversation i had was largely congratulatory , was largely corruption , all of the corruption taking place , was largely the fact that we do n't want our people like vice president biden and his son creating to the corruption already in ukraine . '' trump denied that his hold on military aid for ukraine was linked to the ukrainian government 's refusal to investigate the hunter biden controversy , while also saying that withholding aid for this reason would have been ethically acceptable if he had done it . on september 26 , 2019 , trump accused the person who provided the whistleblower with information of the call of being a `` spy '' and guilty of treason , before noting that treason is punishable by death . senate minority leader chuck schumer on tuesday said there are 10 to 12 senate republicans `` who know in their hearts '' there should be witnesses and documents in president donald trump 's senate impeachment trial ahead of a looming vote later this week . the comments come after senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , a kentucky republican , told his conference earlier tuesday that the votes to shut out witnesses are n't there yet . but senate republicans are growing confident they can defeat a witness vote after weathering the fallout of revelations from former national security adviser john bolton 's draft book manuscript that trump had told him us security assistance to ukraine was conditioned on investigations into democrats , including the bidens . `` there are 10 to 12 republicans who have never said a bad word about witnesses or documents , who know in their hearts it 's the right thing to do .
in reviewing l'enfant 's plan , thomas jefferson insisted the legislative building be called the `` capitol '' rather than `` congress house '' . the word `` capitol '' comes from latin and is associated with the temple of jupiter optimus maximus on capitoline hill , one of the seven hills of rome . the connection between the two is not , however , crystal clear . in addition to coming up with a city plan , l'enfant had been tasked with designing the capitol and president 's house ; however , he was dismissed in february 1792 over disagreements with president george washington and the commissioners , and there were no plans at that point for the capitol . as arizona 's population has grown , the capitol complex itself has become increasingly crowded . the senate and house buildings , opened in 1960 , have been deteriorating . the senate , in particular , is prone to constant plumbing problems , and occasionally a broken pipe floods the entire building . the capitol itself is now used exclusively as a museum , and serves over 70,000 visitors each year , including more than 50,000 school children . john cleese played ridiculous authority figures . gilliam claims that cleese is the funniest of the pythons in drag , as he barely needs to be dressed up to look hilarious , with his square chin and 6 ' 5 '' -lrb- 196 cm -rrb- frame -lrb- see the `` mr. and mrs. git '' sketch -rrb- . cleese also played intimidating maniacs , such as an instructor in the `` self defence against fresh fruit '' sketch . his character mr. praline , the put-upon consumer , featured in some of the most popular sketches , most famously in `` dead parrot '' .
the palestine liberation organization was founded in 1964 . at its first convention in cairo , hundreds of palestinians met to , `` call for the right of self-determination and the upholding of the rights of the palestinian nation . '' in order to achieve these goals , a palestinian army of liberation was thought to be essential ; thus , the palestinian liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- was established with the support of the arab states . fatah , a palestinian group founded in the late 1950s to organize the armed resistance against israel , and headed by yasser arafat , soon rose to prominence within the plo . the palestine liberation organization -lrb- plo ; arabic : منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية , munaẓẓamat at-taḥrīr al-filasṭīniyyah -rrb- is an organization founded in 1964 with the purpose of the `` liberation of palestine '' through armed struggle , with much of its violence aimed at israeli civilians . it is recognized as the `` sole legitimate representative of the palestinian people '' by over 100 states with which it holds diplomatic relations , and has enjoyed observer status at the united nations since 1974 . the plo was considered by the united states and israel to be a terrorist organization until the madrid conference in 1991 . in 1993 , the plo recognized israel 's right to exist in peace , accepted un security council resolutions 242 and 338 , and rejected `` violence and terrorism '' . the dflp retains important influence within the palestine liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- . it was traditionally the third-largest group within the plo , after fatah and the pflp , and since no new elections have been held to the pnc or the executive committee since 1988 , the dflp still commands important sectors within the organization . the plo 's role has admittedly diminished in later years , in favor of the palestinian national authority -lrb- pna -rrb- , but it is still the recognized representative of the palestinian people , and a reactivation of the plo 's constitutional supremacy over the pna in connection with power struggles in palestinian society is a distinct possibility .
max payne has been taken by the police and is about to face charges for his killing spree . however , he is cleared of all charges , thanks to his relationship with a very influential member of society , senator alfred woden . a few years have passed , and max has returned to work for the nypd as a homicide detective . during a routine murder investigation he finds himself face-to-face with the fugitive mona sax , a woman he thought was dead . martin 's influence in the music field is also seen in the effect he has had on co-producers . the music site stereogum singles out three people as his `` disciples '' , savan kotecha , dr. luke , and shellback . time magazine reported that `` there 's a cluster of high-powered songwriters who are based in sweden , and the grandmaster is max martin and that when kotecha worked with one direction he credited martin 's influence ` we work melody first . that 's max martin 's school . seldom hesitating to use herself as the butt of her own jokes , fey is also well known for practicing self-deprecating humor , as demonstrated throughout her performance as liz lemon in 30 rock . in an article ranking fey 's six greatest jokes , david renshaw of the guardian wrote that the performer 's work continues to feature her `` trademark mix of snark , self-deprecation , and pop-culture smarts . '' fey 's self-deprecating comedic style inspired ashley fetters of the atlantic to recognize her as comedian phyllis diller 's successor because of their similar humor . critics have been divided in their opinions and discussions of fey 's use of self-deprecating humor , and its effect on women as a female comic ; while blogger kate harding disapproved of fey 's performance in 30 rock because `` i 'm torn between being sad that she apparently does n't see in herself and being pissed off that she 's reinforcing the idea that having brown hair , glasses , and a figure that 's maybe a size 2 instead of a 0 actually equals ugly , '' jessica g. of jezebel defended the actress , writing that fey 's performance is `` supposed to be parodying precisely the kinds of media that reinforce ideas that unconventional women are unworthy . ''
two earlier business decisions by the chicago sun-times led to substantial savings of time and money during the trump tower 's construction . the original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness , to withstand a cold war attack , and thus did not have to be broken down and rebuilt . furthermore , the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink , which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant . this considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew . crews began hanging the sign in may 2014 . when chicago tribune architecture critic kamin warned trump that his review of the sign would be unfavorable , trump responded `` as time passes , it 'll be like the hollywood sign '' ; architect smith distanced himself from the sign saying `` just for the record , i had nothing to do with this sign ! '' the controversy surrounding the sign drew attention in the national press and international press as it neared completion and the associated press ran a story about mayor emanuel 's disapproval in mid-june . according to the mayor 's spokeswoman kelley quinn , `` mayor emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred by an architecturally tasteless sign '' . bovis lend lease , noted for work on disneyland paris , petronas towers , and the time warner center , was the construction company . james mchugh construction co , the concrete subcontractor , implemented a comprehensive formwork for the construction of the building . at the completion of construction the building was the tallest formwork structure in the world , and follows in the footsteps of its neighbor , marina city , as well as chicago 's two prudential plaza , as past recordholders . concrete moulding was used , because using a traditional ironwork structure would have required a building footprint that would have been too big for the property size , proportional to the height of the designed building .
youtube does not usually offer a download link for its videos , and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface . a small number of videos , can be downloaded as mp4 files . numerous third-party web sites , applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download youtube videos . in february 2009 , youtube announced a test service , allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through google checkout . in february 2007 , viacom sent upwards of 100,000 digital millennium copyright act takedown notices to the video-sharing site youtube . of the 100,000 notices , approximately 60 -- 70 non-infringing videos were removed under the auspices of copyright infringement . on october 9 , 2006 , it was announced that the company would be purchased by google for us$ 1.65 billion in stock , which was completed on november 13 . at that time it was google 's second-largest acquisition . the agreement between google and youtube came after youtube presented three agreements with media companies in an attempt to avoid copyright-infringement lawsuits . youtube planned to continue operating independently , with its co-founders and 68 employees working within google .

in december 2007 it became known that the cia had destroyed many videotapes recording the interrogation of prisoners . disclosures in 2010 revealed that jose rodriguez jr. , head of the directorate of operations at the cia from 2004 to 2007 , ordered the tapes destroyed because he thought they would be `` devastating to the cia '' , and that `` the heat from destroying is nothing compared to what it would be if the tapes ever got into public domain . '' the new york times reported that according to `` some insiders , '' an inquiry into the c.i.a. 's secret detention program which analyzed these techniques , `` might end with criminal charges for abusive interrogations . '' in the summer of 1975 , congressional church committee reports and the presidential rockefeller commission report revealed to the public for the first time that the cia and the department of defense had conducted experiments on both unwitting and cognizant human subjects as part of an extensive program to find out how to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs such as lsd and mescaline and other chemical , biological , and psychological means . they also revealed that at least one subject , frank olson had died after administration of lsd . much of what the church committee and the rockefeller commission learned about mkultra was contained in a report , prepared by the inspector general 's office in 1963 , that had survived the destruction of records ordered in 1973 . however , it contained little detail . only a limited number of copies of the full report were made , and human rights workers are concerned that the cia might succeed in destroying all copies of this report they found so embarrassing . on december 29 , 2016 , less than a month before the end of the obama administration , district court judge royce lamberth ordered the preservation of the full classified report , in case it was needed during the prosecution or appeal of senior suspects during their guantanamo military commissions . also in december 2016 , president obama announced that he would include the report in his presidential archive . after 12 years , a request could be made for the declassification process to start for the full report 's release .

the full syndrome now known as lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was identified in three towns in southeastern connecticut in 1975 , including the towns lyme and old lyme , which gave the disease its popular name . this was investigated by physicians david snydman and allen steere of the epidemic intelligence service , and by others from yale university , including stephen malawista , who is credited as a co-discover of the disease . the recognition that the people in the united states had em led to the recognition that `` lyme arthritis '' was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in europe . in 1992 , mark l. rosenberg and five cdc colleagues founded the cdc 's national center for injury prevention and control , with an annual budget of c. $ 260,000 that focused on `` identifying the root causes of firearm deaths and the best methods to prevent them '' . their first report which was published in the new england journal of medicine in 1993 , entitled `` gun ownership as a risk factor for homicide in the home '' reported that the `` mere presence of a gun in a home increased the risk of a firearm-related death by 2.7 percent , and suicide fivefold -- a `` huge '' increase .

the idea of benevolent dictatorship has a long history , dating back to various positively perceived rulers during ancient times , where authoritarian leadership was the norm . modern usage of the term in a world society where the norm leans much more toward democracy can be traced back to john stuart mill in his classic on liberty -lrb- 1869 -rrb- . although he argued in favor of democratic rights for individuals , he did make an exception for what he called today 's developing countries : during the cold war , the terms `` communists '' or `` reds '' were believed by many in american society to mean `` the enemy , '' and the meaning of the two terms could be extremely pejorative , depending on the political context , mood , or state of fear and agitation within the society at the time . for example , according to evolutionary psychology , coalitional aggression is more commonly found with males . this is because of their psychological mechanism designed since ancestral times . during those times men had more to earn when winning wars compared to women -lrb- they had more chance of finding a mate , or even many mates -rrb- . also , the victorious men had more chance of reproduction which eventually led to the succession of aggressive , eager-to-war dnas .

marco rubio is dropping out of the presidential race after losing the florida primary to donald trump and failing to unite the republican establishment against the billionaire front-runner . `` we live in a republic and our voters make these decisions , '' rubio said in miami tuesday night as his supporters booed trump 's victory . his speech was a thinly veiled rebuke of trump 's campaign tactics , as he warned that it would have been easier for him to exploit the anger and anxiety driving the race . he warned that the politics of division were going to leave america a `` fractured nation .

obama spoke in front of the african union in addis ababa , ethiopia , on july 29 , 2015 , the first sitting u.s. president to do so . he gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent , and lauded the progress made in education , infrastructure , and economy . he also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside , discrimination against minorities -lrb- lgbt people , religious groups and ethnicities -rrb- , and corruption . he suggested an intensified democratization and free trade , to significantly improve the quality of life for africans . decisions by republican incumbent peter fitzgerald and his democratic predecessor carol moseley braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open democratic and republican primary contests involving 15 candidates . in the march 2004 primary election , obama won in an unexpected landslide -- which overnight made him a rising star within the national democratic party , started speculation about a presidential future , and led to the reissue of his memoir , dreams from my father . in july 2004 , obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 democratic national convention , seen by nine million viewers . his speech was well received and elevated his status within the democratic party . obama concluded the second paragraph of his address by saying , `` we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents . '' the speech reinforced words such as `` legacy '' and `` heritage '' , as well as values such as `` honesty '' , `` courage '' and `` patriotism '' , which `` are old '' values . near the end of the speech , obama referred to words written by thomas paine in the american crisis , which were ordered by george washington to be read to his troops : `` let it be told to the future world ... that in the depth of winter , when nothing but hope and virtue could survive ... that the city and the country , alarmed at one common danger , came forth to meet . '' because obama 's campaign message focused on the need for change , mackin noted that obama sought to reassure americans that he would operate as president within the margins of the nation 's traditions .
the federal aviation administration -lrb- faa -rrb- is a governmental body of the united states with powers to regulate all aspects of civil aviation in that nation as well as over its surrounding international waters . its powers include the construction and operation of airports , air traffic management , the certification of personnel and aircraft , and the protection of u.s. assets during the launch or re-entry of commercial space vehicles . powers over neighboring international waters were delegated to the faa by authority of the international civil aviation organization . created in august 1958 , the faa replaced the former civil aeronautics administration -lrb- caa -rrb- and later became an agency within the u.s. department of transportation . in 2007 , two faa whistleblowers , inspectors charalambe `` bobby '' boutris and douglas e. peters , alleged that boutris said he attempted to ground southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage of an aircraft , but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline . this was validated by a report by the department of transportation which found faa managers had allowed southwest airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections , ignoring concerns raised by inspectors . audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes , causing thousands of flight cancellations . the house transportation and infrastructure committee held hearings in april 2008 . as a result of the march 10 , 2019 ethiopian airlines flight 302 crash and the lion air flight 610 crash five months earlier , most airlines and countries began grounding the boeing 737 max 8 -lrb- and in many cases all max variants -rrb- due to safety concerns , but the faa declined to temporarily ground boeing 737 max 8 aircraft operating in the u.s. on march 12 , the faa said that its ongoing review showed `` no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft . '' some u.s. senators called for the faa to ground the aircraft until an investigation into the cause of the ethiopian airlines crash was complete . u.s. transportation secretary elaine chao said that `` if the faa identifies an issue that affects safety , the department will take immediate and appropriate action .

using her husband 's name , she obtains a service post in the household of the marquess of flintshire since the marchioness of flintshire is the earl of grantham 's cousin . the marchioness 's lady 's maid tells vera about lady mary 's liaison with kemal pamuk . when vera learns that her husband has a larger than expected inheritance after his mother 's death , she arrives at downton abbey . she asks for large amounts of money , refusing a divorce so he can not marry fellow servant anna , and blackmails him , threatening to expose lady mary 's secret . in the second christmas special , she accompanies lady grantham to scotland to visit duneagle castle . while there , she apparently comes to like lady flintshire , and manages to arrange to become her lady 's maid . she leaves downton at the very beginning of the fourth series in the middle of the night to take her new position , leaving only a letter to explain her actions . robert crawley , 7th earl of grantham -lrb- played by hugh bonneville -rrb- -lrb- b. 1866 -rrb- is the current earl of grantham . he is the husband of cora , son of violet , and father of mary , edith and sybil . robert is immensely proud of downton as the place he grew up and takes his responsibility for the estate very seriously .
on april 29 , 1992 , at 5:39 pm , denny loaded his red dump truck with 27 short tons -lrb- 24 t -rrb- of sand and began driving to a plant in inglewood , where the sand was due . he left the santa monica freeway and took a familiar shortcut across florence avenue to get to his destination . his truck had no radio , so he did not realize that he was driving into a riot . at 6:46 pm , after entering the intersection at normandie , rioters threw rocks at his windows , and he heard people shouting for him to stop , forcing him to do so in the middle of the street . they created one self-titled album , which included an eight-minute version of the traditional `` banks of the nile '' , and several denny originals , among them `` the sea '' and `` nothing more '' . the latter marked her first composition on the piano , which was to become her primary instrument from then on . fotheringay started to record a second album in late 1970 , but it remained unfinished after denny announced that she was leaving the group and producer joe boyd left to take up a job at warner brothers in california . denny would later blame boyd 's hostility towards the group for its demise . sand hill road , often shortened to just `` sand hill '' , is an arterial road in western silicon valley , california , running through palo alto , menlo park , and woodside , notable for its concentration of venture capital companies . the road has become a metonym for that industry ; nearly every top silicon valley company has been the beneficiary of early funding from firms on sand hill road.its significance as a symbol of private equity and venture capitalism in the united states is compared to that of wall street and the stock market , and k street in washington , d.c. and political lobbying .
the `` club cab '' was dropped from the lineup after 1982 , but dodge kept the tooling and re-introduced nearly a decade later in the 1991 models . the four-door crew cab and utiline beds were dropped after the 1985 model year , to make room on the assembly line for the upcoming 1987 dodge dakota , and were never reintroduced in this generation . to capitalize on this heritage , the city promotes its downtown business district as historic old dodge city complete with western-themed tourist attractions , shops , and restaurants . visitors can tour the district by trolley or by taking the dodge city trail of fame walking tour . the state of kansas operates the similarly themed boot hill casino & resort on the west side of the city -- when it opened for business in december 2009 , boot hill became the first state-owned casino in the united states . as the market evolved , dodge realized that a bigger and stronger van line would be needed in the future , and thus the b series was introduced for 1971 , and offered both car-like comfort in its sportsman passenger line or expansive room for gear and materials in its tradesman cargo line . a chassis cab version was also offered for use with bigger cargo boxes or flatbeds . like the trucks , chrysler 's dire financial straits of the late 1970s precluded any major updates for the vans for many years . rebadged as the ram van and ram wagon for 1981 , this old design carried on for 33 years with little more than cosmetic and safety updates all the way to 2003 .
in brazil , the dia dos namorados -lrb- lit . `` lovers ' day '' , or `` boyfriends ' / girlfriends ' day '' -rrb- is celebrated on june 12 , probably because that is the day before saint anthony 's day , known there as the marriage saint , when traditionally many single women perform popular rituals , called simpatias , in order to find a good husband or boyfriend . couples exchange gifts , chocolates , cards , and flower bouquets . the february 14 valentine 's day is not celebrated at all because it usually falls too little before or too little after the brazilian carnival -- that can fall anywhere from early february to early march and lasts almost a week . over the years colorado state university has had a few different mascots . in 1919 there was a black bear cub that served as the mascot not much was known about the cub . it was unknown where the bear came from or even its name , just as he mysteriously appeared , he disappeared the same year . he was replaced by peanuts the bulldog in 1912 . there are many other legends behind saint valentine . one is that in the 3rd century ad it is said that valentine , who was a priest , defied the order of the emperor claudius and secretly performed christian weddings for couples , allowing the husbands involved to escape conscription . the legend claims that soldiers were sparse at this time so this was a big inconvenience to the emperor . the account mentions that in order `` to remind these men of their vows and god 's love , saint valentine is said to have cut hearts from parchment '' , giving them to these soldiers and persecuted christians , a possible origin of the widespread use of hearts on st. valentine 's day .

british celebrity chef gary rhodes has died aged 59 , his family says . in a statement reported by the pa media news agency , the family said : `` the rhodes family are deeply saddened to announce the passing of beloved husband , father and brother , gary rhodes obe . '' the family said rhodes died on tuesday evening with his wife jennie at his side . rhodes was filming a new series in dubai for rock oyster media and goldfinch tv , the production companies said in a joint statement wednesday . a bronze cockerel looted by british soldiers in the 19th century and later given to jesus college at the university of cambridge will be repatriated to nigeria . the artifact , described as a royal ancestral heirloom , was found to have been stolen in 1897 during a punitive expedition in the kingdom of benin , in present-day nigeria , according to the legacy of slavery working party -lrb- lswp -rrb- , the college said . a group of academics , activists , and students , lswp was created this year to establish the college 's historical ties with the slave trade . members have held discussions with a member of the benin dialogue group over the last three years to determine the origin of the artifact . the britons , also known as celtic britons or ancient britons , were celtic people who inhabited great britain from at least the british iron age into the middle ages , at which point their culture and language diverged into the modern welsh , cornish and bretons -lrb- among others -rrb- . they spoke the common brittonic language , the ancestor to the modern brittonic languages.the traditional view that the celtic britons originally migrated from the continent , mostly across the english channel , with their languages , culture and genes in the iron age has been considerably undermined in recent decades by the contention of many scholars that celtic languages had instead spread north along the atlantic seaboard during the bronze age , and the results of genetic studies , which show a large continuity between iron age and older british populations , suggesting trans-cultural diffusion was also very important in the introduction of the celtic languages . the earliest evidence for the britons and their language in historical sources dates to the iron age . after the roman conquest of britain in the 1st century , a romano-british culture emerged , and latin and british vulgar latin coexisted with brittonic .

prayer plays a significant role among many believers . muslims believe that the purpose of existence is to worship god . he is viewed as a personal god and there are no intermediaries , such as clergy , to contact god . prayer often also includes supplication and asking forgiveness . many traditions see god as incorporeal and eternal , and regard him as a point of living light like human souls , but without a physical body , as he does not enter the cycle of birth , death and rebirth . god is seen as the perfect and constant embodiment of all virtues , powers and values and that he is the unconditionally loving father of all souls , irrespective of their religion , gender , or culture . it appears that when early artists designed to represent god the father , fear and awe restrained them from a usage of the whole human figure . typically only a small part would be used as the image , usually the hand , or sometimes the face , but rarely a whole human . in many images , the figure of the son supplants the father , so a smaller portion of the person of the father is depicted .
it was announced that jessica simpson and then-husband nick lachey would star in their own mtv reality series , newlyweds : nick and jessica . the series , which chronicled jessica and nick 's life as a married couple , became a pop culture phenomenon and helped draw attention to the simpson sisters . following the success of the series , it was confirmed that ashlee would receive a spin-off series , the ashlee simpson show . hoping to end comparisons between her and her sister , ashlee wanted the series to focus on the recording of her debut album . with the release of sweet kisses -lrb- 1999 -rrb- , simpson and her team marketed simpson as `` anti-sex appeal '' , as a contrast to artists such as britney spears and christina aguilera who had recently achieved success with their respective debut albums . the music found on her debut album mostly spoke on topics such as love , and simpson announced that she would remain abstinent until marriage . though the album sold four million copies worldwide , it failed to meet the expectations of columbia records ; as a result , the label hoped to see jessica mature her image for the release of her second album . she moved into the teen-pop genre , as she felt that restyling herself to match the image of spears and aguilera would help remake her career . she separated from her then-boyfriend nick lachey , in march 2001 , feeling the need to concentrate on her career . her new image was promoted through appearances on many events , where simpson wore revealing outfits . the development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort , irresistible .
also at this time , pepsico had envisioned marketing frito-lay snacks alongside pepsi-cola soft drinks . in an interview with forbes in 1968 , pepsico ceo donald kendall summarized this by noting that `` potato chips make you thirsty ; pepsi satisfies thirst . '' plans to jointly promote the soft drink and snack products were thwarted later that year , when the federal trade commission ruled against it . in 1965 , frito-lay merged with the pepsi-cola company to form pepsico , inc. . a new formulation of chip was introduced in 1991 that was crisper and kept fresher longer . shortly thereafter , the company introduced the `` wavy lays '' products to grocery shelves . in the mid to late 1990s , lay 's introduced a lower calorie baked version and a variety that was completely fat-free -lrb- lay 's wow chips containing the fat substitute olestra -rrb- . upon the formation of pepsico , frito-lay soon began efforts to expand with the development of new snack food brands in the 1960s and 1970s , including doritos -lrb- 1966 -rrb- , funyuns -lrb- 1969 -rrb- , and munchos -lrb- 1971 -rrb- . the most popular new frito-lay product launched during this era was doritos , which initially was positioned as a more flavorful tortilla chip . at first the chip was perceived by consumers as being too bland . in response , the company re-launched doritos in taco , and later nacho cheese , flavors .
president donald trump is not angry at his attorney rudy giuliani , despite the former new york mayor 's contradictory answers in recent interviews about a proposed trump tower project in moscow , sources told cnn tuesday -- and giuliani is not going anywhere . a source familiar with the trump legal team told cnn on tuesday , `` rudy 's not getting fired . '' giuliani has been the subject of intense scrutiny this week after talking himself into hot water during interviews on sunday morning news programs . in one interview , giuliani said trump had been in talks over the proposed moscow trump tower project throughout the presidential campaign , possibly as late as october or november 2016 . here 's a good way to think about rudy giuliani 's handling of questions about when -lrb- or if -rrb- president donald trump had conversations during the 2016 campaign with his one-time lawyer michael cohen about plans to build trump tower moscow : you throw 10 balls in the air at once and , only as they are all hurtling back toward you -- and the ground -- do you realize you only have two hands and ca n't possibly hope to catch them all . over the past 48 hours , it has all come crashing down around giuliani . let 's start on sunday , when giuliani did a round of sunday show interviews -- including one with `` meet the press '' host chuck todd . here 's the relevant exchange about how long trump was talking to cohen about the potential project -lrb- bolding is mine -rrb- : giuliani : well , it 's our understanding that it -- that they went on throughout 2016 . president donald trump 's attorney rudy giuliani said monday that the president had no recollection of whether discussions about a proposed trump tower moscow project went through the 2016 election , distancing himself from a claim he made sunday . giuliani 's remarks were an attempt at damage control after comments he made a day prior when he said the talks about the moscow project continued through the campaign , even possibly as late as october or november 2016 . adjusting his previous timeline , giuliani told cnn on monday that there was no way of determining exactly when the discussions ended because they had no record of it . `` my recent statements about discussions during the 2016 campaign between michael cohen and then-candidate donald trump about a potential trump moscow ` project ' were hypothetical and not based on conversations i had with the president , '' giuliani said in a statement .
education of the general public about the risk factors for ebola infection and of the protective measures individuals may take to prevent infection is recommended by the world health organization . these measures include avoiding direct contact with infected people and regular hand washing using soap and water . the risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment . it requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva . if a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying borrelia is found attached to a person and removed , and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged , a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may reduce the risk of lyme disease . it is not generally recommended for all people bitten , as development of infection is rare : about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans -lrb- i.e. examination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of lyme disease . key spots to examine include the head , neck , and ears .
the papal basilica of st. peter in the vatican -lrb- italian : basilica papale di san pietro in vaticano -rrb- , or simply st. peter 's basilica -lrb- latin : basilica sancti petri -rrb- , is a church built in the renaissance style located in vatican city , the papal enclave which is within the city of rome . designed principally by donato bramante , michelangelo , carlo maderno and gian lorenzo bernini , st. peter 's is the most renowned work of renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world . while it is neither the mother church of the catholic church nor the cathedral of the diocese of rome , st. peter 's is regarded as one of the holiest catholic shrines . it has been described as `` holding a unique position in the christian world '' and as `` the greatest of all churches of christendom '' . catholic tradition holds that the basilica is the burial site of saint peter , chief among jesus 's apostles and also the first bishop of rome -lrb- pope -rrb- . pope benedict 's main arena for pastoral activity was the vatican itself , his christmas and easter homilies and urbi et orbi are delivered from st peter 's basilica . the vatican is also the only regular place where benedict xvi traveled via motor without the protective bulletproof case common to most popemobiles . despite the more secure setting , pope benedict was victim to security risks several times inside vatican city . on wednesday , 6 june 2007 during his general audience a man leapt across a barrier , evaded guards and nearly mounted the pope 's vehicle , although he was stopped and benedict seemed to be unaware of the event . on 16 july 1228 , he was pronounced a saint by pope gregory ix -lrb- the former cardinal ugolino di conti , friend of saint francis and cardinal protector of the order -rrb- . the next day , the pope laid the foundation stone for the basilica of saint francis in assisi . francis was buried on 25 may 1230 , under the lower basilica , but his tomb was soon hidden on orders of brother elias to protect it from saracen invaders . his exact burial place remained unknown until it was re-discovered in 1818 .
after an election season that has left americans more than a little shaken -lrb- and the rest of the world uneasy about american democracy -rrb- , voters can take comfort knowing that one of the candidates kept her cool through the debates -- despite the insults , the lies , and the endless challenges of the campaign . by doing so , hillary clinton showed she has the mettle required of the next president as he , or more likely she , faces a swarm of increasingly complicated international crises in a male-dominated world . and in the process , she has managed to crush stereotypes about women . america 's rambunctious , costly and seemingly endless election ritual has become a brutal darwinian test of , among other attributes , psychological fortitude . since the formation of nato in 1949 the defense of europe and the free world has depended on the absolute certainty that whatever president is occupying the white house , the united states will come to the aid of a nato member if attacked . any doubt about the american commitment , and the credibility of nato 's doctrine of collective defense , is holed below the waterline . at a time when the west faces a greater threat from a resurgent russia since the most dangerous crises of the cold war , nato , more than ever , needs to stand strong , united and credible . russia 's invasion of crimea and ukraine in 2014 may have already lit the fuse that could lead to the unthinkable : nuclear war with russia in europe . she testified in public before the same body on november 21 , 2019 . while being questioned by steve castor , the counsel for the house intelligence committee 's republican minority , hill commented on gordon sondland 's involvement in the ukraine matter : `` it struck me when -lrb- wednesday -rrb- , when you put up on the screen ambassador sondland 's emails , and who was on these emails , and he said these are the people who need to know , that he was absolutely right , '' she said . `` because he was being involved in a domestic political errand , and we were being involved in national security foreign policy . and those two things had just diverged .

goldman has been criticized in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007 -- 2008 , where some alleged that it misled its investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market . that time in goldman 's history brought investigations from the united states congress , the united states department of justice , and a lawsuit from the u.s. securities and exchange commission that resulted in goldman paying a $ 550 million settlement . goldman sachs was `` excoriated by the press and the public '' despite the non-retail nature of its business that would normally have kept it out of the public eye . visibility and antagonism came from the $ 12.9 billion goldman received , more than any other firm , from aig counterparty payments provided by the bailout of aig , the $ 10 billion in tarp money it received from the government -lrb- though the firm paid this back to the government -rrb- , and a record $ 11.4 billion set aside for employee bonuses in the first half of 2009 . bank stocks surged after donald trump was elected on the hopes that he would scale back some of president obama 's wall street reforms and boost the economy with a massive stimulus package . and even though trump bashed wall street -lrb- and his opponent hillary clinton 's ties to big banks -rrb- repeatedly during the campaign , trump tapped several former goldman sachs employees for key posts in the white house . the two most notable were treasury secretary steven mnuchin and national economic council director gary cohn , who even stepped down as goldman coo to take the job . so it seemed that it was nothing but blue skies ahead for financial stocks . on april 14 , 2011 , the united states senate 's permanent subcommittee on investigations released a 635-page report entitled wall street and the financial crisis : anatomy of a financial collapse which described some of the causes of the financial crisis . the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense . the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the united states department of justice to determine whether goldman executives had broken the law , and two months later the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed goldman for relevant information on possible securities fraud , but on august 9 the justice department announced it had decided not to file charges against goldman sachs or its employees for trades made during the subprime mortgage portfolio .
the gop race is down to the final four candidates , and last night 's fox news debate showed the wear and tear of an already bruising campaign on each of them . from the opening bell until the closing round , the candidates took heavy swings at each other , sometimes connecting , more often missing in the flurried exchanges . and perhaps due to some last-minute desperation , the disagreements on stage occasionally veered from heated to embarrassing . for three of the four candidates , the sense of urgency was palpable . size matters . the gop debate in detroit thursday night had been underway for just seven minutes when this point was made crystal clear . republican debate turns dirty as the number of candidates still in the race has shrunk , tonight carried the promise of learning more about the remaining four . instead , the personal insults began flying right away , most notably between marco rubio and donald trump . imagine if every gop debate had been like the one thursday night . policy heavy , insult light and providing voters with a contrast between the candidates over level of knowledge on issues . it was clear that each candidate had shifted tactics from the last dumpster fire of a debate . after sen. marco rubio 's mudslinging with donald trump hurt his campaign , he decided to return to his above-the-fray , aspirational tone .
gore had been involved with computers since the 1970s , first as a congressman and later as senator and vice president , where he was a `` genuine nerd , with a geek reputation running back to his days as a futurist atari democrat in the house . before computers were comprehensible ... gore struggled to explain artificial intelligence and fiber-optic networks to sleepy colleagues . '' according to campbell-kelly and aspray -lrb- computer : a history of the information machine -rrb- , up until the early 1990s public usage of the internet was limited and the `` problem of giving ordinary americans network access had excited senator al gore since the late 1970s . '' soon afterwards , gore contended with the lewinsky scandal , involving an affair between president clinton and an intern , monica lewinsky . gore initially defended clinton , whom he believed to be innocent , stating , `` he is the president of the country ! he is my friend ... i want to ask you now , every single one of you , to join me in supporting him . '' i did n't ask him about the internet . i asked him about the differences he had with bill bradley ... honestly , at the time , when he said it , it did n't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having , because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said , which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative in creating the internet to -- i invented the internet . and that was the sort of shorthand , the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him , as i 'm sure he acknowledges to this very day .
amy was originally a patrol officer at the 64th precinct but requested a transfer to the 99th when her captain almost sexually assaulted her shortly after her promotion to detective . she did n't tell anyone for years out of fear for what it would do to her career until she revealed it to jake when they were investigating a sexual assault case in `` he said , she said '' . holt is married to kevin cozner , the chair of columbia university 's classics department , and has a longstanding professional rivalry with madeline wuntch , with whom he came up through the ranks ; while his career stalled , she kept advancing and is now his immediate superior . after he and peralta successfully solved a major case in `` the chopper '' , bureau chief wuntch nominated him for a promotion to head of the nypd public affairs division , a promotion he accepted lest wuntch transfer his staff to horrible posts around new york city . during the number of weeks he was in charge of public affairs , holt was unable to accomplish anything significant thanks to chief wuntch 's constant micromanaging . after helping peralta solve a serial killer case , holt found himself transferred back to command of the 9-9 by the chief of brooklyn detectives . in season five , amy achieves her dream of being the youngest woman to pass the sergeant 's exam . it is not known exactly how old amy is , but she is under 35 as of the episode `` cop-con '' . in season six she is revealed to be 36 years old .
the united states of america -lrb- usa -rrb- , commonly known as the united states -lrb- u.s. or us -rrb- or america , is a country comprising 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . at 3.8 million square miles -lrb- 9.8 million km2 -rrb- , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of europe . most of the country is located in central north america between canada and mexico . with an estimated population of over 328 million , the u.s. is the third most populous country .
in 1993 , the university of minnesota crookston became a baccalaureate degree granting institution . that same year , the university launched its `` laptop u '' initiative , providing laptop computers to all students and faculty . it is recognized as one of the first programs of its kind in the united states . over the next few years , more than 100 colleges and universities from across the u.s. and canada visited the campus to learn more about this innovation . in 1995 , the seven state universities were transferred to the newly created minnesota state colleges and universities system by a mandate from the state legislature . shortly after this , the university was renamed minnesota state university , mankato in 1998 in recognition of its significant contribution to the state 's higher education system . this name change was also intended to broaden recognition of the university in the midwest region . dr. richard rush , then the president of the university had famously stated about the name change that : our goal is to make this university the other great public university in minnesota , this marked a significant change in direction in the history of the institution , one that would later be realized as it fought for the authorization of being able to award doctoral degrees . the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical , geographical , and political context in which it is used . american is derived from america , a term originally denoting all of the new world -lrb- also called the americas -rrb- . in some expressions , it retains this pan-american sense , but its usage has evolved over time and , for various historical reasons , the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america . in modern english , american generally refers to persons or things related to the united states of america ; among native english speakers this usage is almost universal , with any other use of the term requiring specification .
like the english and irish country houses it was modeled on , the white house was , from the start , open to the public until the early part of the 20th century . president thomas jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805 , and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the capitol followed him home , where he greeted them in the blue room . those open houses sometimes became rowdy : in 1829 , president andrew jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the white house . his aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey . although still a subunit of the eop , the white house office remains the centerpiece of the presidential staff system . in many ways it is closest to the president both in physical proximity , its top aides occupy most of the offices in the west wing , and in its impact on the day-to-day operations , deliberations , policy agendas , and public communications of a presidency . during the transition to office and continuing throughout an administration , the president enjoys a great deal of discretion in terms of how the white house office is organized . the white house `` beat '' concept that had been started during the cleveland administration by reporter william price was continued during the mckinley administration . around the time of the outbreak of the spanish -- american war in 1898 , the reporters covering the white house were invited into the mansion itself and provided with space to write , conduct interviews , and generally cover the white house . now reporting from inside the white house , the reporters used their new location to interview guests entering or leaving the white house or confirm pieces of information from the president 's secretaries as they passed through in the course of their duties . reporters working in the white house did , however , honor an unspoken rule and refrain from asking the president himself a question if he happened to walk through their working area .
the exercise of this option is , generally , inferior to seeking participatory exploitation ; in other words , engagement in joint venture , typically in regions where the technology would be in the ascent phase , as say , a developing country . in addition to providing financial opportunity it allows the technology-owner a degree of control over its use . gain flows from the two streams of investment-based and royalty incomes . further , the vital life of the technology is enhanced in such strategy . yet , because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies , hughes argues that engineers , scientists , and managers have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want . they have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned . for instance , evgeny morozov particularly challenges two concepts : `` internet-centrism '' and `` solutionism . '' internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces . the simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools . the prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later neolithic revolution increased the available sources of food , and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment . developments in historic times , including the printing press , the telephone , and the internet , have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale .
on october 6 , 2015 , following reports that a draftkings employee had used inside information to win $ 350,000 on fanduel , new york attorney general eric schneiderman announced that he had opened an investigation into the two services and the allegations that employees from the two services were using this information to win prizes from each other . both sites have since barred their employees from participating in daily fantasy games . on october 14 , 2015 , the fbi launched an investigation of its own into the two services regarding the inside information scandal . on november 17 , 2015 , the attorney general filed a request for a temporary injunction to force draftkings and fanduel to cease serving customers in the state of new york . in the filing , schneiderman argued that dfs was merely a `` re-branding '' of sports betting , and in response to claims that dfs constitutes a game of skill , he argued that `` a few good players in a poker tournament may rise to the top based on their skill ; but the game is still gambling . '' schneiderman also acknowledged that the two services had `` basic compliance issues '' -lrb- alluding to the inside information scandal -rrb- , had associated themselves with gambling-oriented entities , and that draftkings had accepted entry fees from users in states where it argued that dfs was illegal . the attorney general also issued a subpoena for information from yahoo! the white house on tuesday backtracked on president barack obama 's blanket assertion earlier this week that hillary clinton 's use of a private email server as secretary of state did n't pose a national security threat . asked outright in an interview on cbs ' `` 60 minutes , '' obama said , `` i do n't think it posed a national security problem . '' but asked how the president was able to make such a definitive statement even as the fbi is looking into the server 's security , white house press secretary josh earnest clarified that obama 's statement was made `` based on what we publicly know now . '' `` the president was making an observation about what we know so far , which is that secretary clinton herself has turned over a bunch of email to the state department , and the review of that email has garnered some differing assessments about what 's included in there , '' earnest said .
clark always stated that he was more of a traditionalist when it came to guitars . this can be seen in his selection of gear . at the time of his death , it was estimated that he owned approximately 75 guitars . after taking a small break from poker , viktor came back strong . he deposited 10,000 sek and decided to stick to heads-up no-limit hold 'em . after just two weeks of play , he went from playing 1/2 sek to 50/100 sek . after viktor turned 17 , he deposited $ 2,500 on partypoker . eastwood began his career by using his given last name to avoid nepotism , although there is another actor named scott reeves . `` i 've auditioned for pretty much every one of my father 's movies '' , he said in 2015 , stating that he was rejected for the clint eastwood-directed american sniper . he briefly appeared in his father 's 2008 film gran torino , and played joel stransky in invictus .

the policy change was prompted by attempts to be more inclusive and lawsuits . atheist parents sued the boy scouts of america in 1991 for denying membership in the cub scouts to their sons . considering this news , the totem girl scout council of seattle attempted to change the girl scout promise to make mention of `` god '' optional , which would be more inclusive of local non-theist native american and southeast asian girls . after the national organization asserted this could not be changed locally , the seattle council advocated that the change be adopted nation-wide . the `` best friends '' line was introduced in 2004 ; supplemental characters from the core book series were created in doll form and marketed as `` best friends '' for some of the historical characters . these best friend dolls share the collections of the main characters , but each has her own book , and additional products were marketed under their names . however , in may 2014 , american girl announced that ruthie , along with ivy , cécile and marie-grace , will be retired from their historical roster , citing business reasons as they decided `` to move away from the character-friend strategy within the line '' . american girl attracted considerable criticism in february 2017 when they announced that they will be changing the dolls ' bodies to incorporate permanently stitched panties on contemporary dolls and certain beforever character dolls , namely maryellen , melody and julie . public reaction to the permanent underwear -- the first major change since the transition to flesh-colored bodies in 1991 following the release of the felicity doll -- was overwhelmingly negative , as fans of the franchise complained that it stifles customization and devalued a well-established and successful brand `` from heirloom quality to be passed down for generations to low-quality retail .

americans are making a big mistake with their investment decisions . even when it comes to money they wo n't need for more than a decade , 26 % of americans prefer cash for their long-term investments , edging out stocks , bonds , gold and real estate , according to a new bankrate survey of more than 1,000 u.s. adults . `` what people are perceiving as a safe investment strategy is actually quite risky for a time horizon of 10 years or more , '' said greg mcbride , bankrate 's senior financial analyst . `` considering that americans do n't save enough to begin with , it has the potential to leave millions of them well short of the money they 'll need for retirement or education funds for their children .

chris whipple , author of the gatekeepers : how the white house chiefs of staff define every presidency , loosely describes the role of a white house chief of staff through his interview with former president barack obama : `` during the last days of his presidency , barack obama observed : ` one of the things i 've learned is that the big breakthroughs are typically the result of a lot of grunt work -- just a whole lot of blocking and tackling . ' grunt work is what chiefs of staff do . '' the white house is the official residence and workplace of the president of the united states . it is located at 1600 pennsylvania avenue nw in washington , d.c. and has been the residence of every u.s. president since john adams in 1800 . the term `` white house '' is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers . news of the scandal first broke on january 17 , 1998 , on the drudge report , which reported that newsweek editors were sitting on a story by investigative reporter michael isikoff exposing the affair . the story broke in the mainstream press on january 21 in the washington post . the story swirled for several days and , despite swift denials from clinton , the clamor for answers from the white house grew louder . on january 26 , president clinton , standing with his wife , spoke at a white house press conference , and issued a denial in which he said :
significantly , the authors recommended an external review of the iwk health centre , the halifax hospital where she was a patient for five weeks after she had a breakdown and became suicidal . canning said that parsons was strip-searched by two men while receiving treatment in 2012 at the iwk , while the iwk denied the allegations . prior to december 2018 , meadows claimed to have received a bachelor of arts degree . when questions about his credentials arose during media speculation that he was under consideration to serve as white house chief of staff , meadows amended his official house biography and other sources to indicate that his degree was an associate , not a bachelor 's . franklin d. roosevelt selected the site of the hospital , laid the cornerstone , and made formal dedication remarks at the hospital 's opening on november 11 , 1940 . when nnmc was dedicated in 1942 , its original intention was to provide medical care to military personnel only . but since franklin d. roosevelt had paralysis of his lower extremities , the medical center immediately offered to provide the president with any medicine or treatment necessary to keep him physically fit for the presidency . with that , an official white house doctor was appointed by the president to sort out medical issues with him .

the united states has concluded syria carried out chemical weapons attacks against its people , president barack obama said wednesday , a claim that comes amid a looming diplomatic showdown over whether to strike against bashar al-assad 's military . obama 's declaration to `` pbs newshour '' came at the end of a day that saw russia and china walk out of a u.n. security council meeting as word surfaced britain planned to pursue a resolution to authorize the use of force against syria , even as united nations weapons inspectors were in syria assessing whether chemical weapons have been used . `` we do not believe that , given the delivery systems , using rockets , that the opposition could have carried out these attacks . we have concluded that the syrian government in fact carried these out , '' obama told `` newshour . '' saying `` there is no doubt who is responsible for this heinous use of chemical weapons attack in syria : the syrian regime , '' vice president joe biden signaled tuesday that the united states -- with its allies -- was ready to act . `` those who use chemical weapons against defenseless men , women and children should and must be held accountable , '' biden said in a speech to the american legion . the vice president 's remarks echo those made by other u.s. officials in recent days , as well as many of the nation 's foremost allies . french president francois hollande said his administration was `` ready to punish those who made the decision to gas these innocent people , '' adding that `` everything leads us to believe '' that syrian president bashar al-assad 's forces are responsible . declaring himself `` war-weary '' but determined to hold syria accountable for using banned chemical weapons , president barack obama said friday he was considering a limited response to what u.s. intelligence assessed with `` high confidence '' as a syrian attack that killed more than 1,400 people . obama told reporters he had yet to make a final decision , but hinted at a military strike that sources and experts say would entail cruise missiles fired from u.s. navy ships at syrian command targets -- but not at any chemical weapons stockpiles . `` it is not in the national security interests of the united states to ignore clear violations '' of what he called an `` international norm '' banning the use of chemical weapons , obama said at a meeting with visiting heads of baltic nations lithuania , latvia and estonia . he called the syrian attack a `` challenge to the world '' that threatens u.s. allies israel , turkey and jordan while increasing the risk of such weapons falling into the hands of terrorists .

america 's top intelligence official on thursday night challenged news reports claiming facebook posts , gmail messages and more have been intercepted for years in a vast data-mining operation , saying the reports `` contain numerous inaccuracies . '' the guardian , a british newspaper , and the washington post reported thursday that u.s. intelligence agencies had access to the central servers of nine of the country 's biggest technology firms including microsoft , apple , google , yahoo and facebook . the post reported the program -- called prism -- underwent `` exponential growth '' since its founding in 2007 . in fact , the newspaper said the program has become the leading source of raw material for the national security agency , the secretive u.s. intelligence operation that monitors electronic communications . reports that the nsa is collecting extensive phone and internet data from u.s. citizens have ignited a debate about privacy versus security among government officials and american citizens . jim harper , director of information policy studies at the cato institute , weighs in on the controversy . `` if we 're gon na have a debate about privacy versus security let 's have it in the open , '' harpe says . `` let 's have some oversight of the national security agency and let 's have some oversight on the part of congress . phone records obtained by the government through a secret surveillance program disclosed last week helped to prevent `` dozens '' of terrorist acts , the director of the national security agency told a senate hearing on wednesday . army gen. keith alexander provided the most detailed account so far from a government official of the program in which the agency collects phone records that then can be accessed under federal court permission to investigate suspected terrorists . the scope of the secret program -- potentially involving phone records of every american -- set off a political firestorm when details emerged with publication of a leaked document . further leaks revealed other secret programs that collect computer activity and other information .

the proto-celtic language , also called common celtic , is the partially reconstructed ancestor language of all the known celtic languages . its lexis , or vocabulary , can be confidently reconstructed on the basis of the comparative method of historical linguistics , in the same manner as proto-indo-european or pie , the ancient language which has been most thoroughly re-constructed . proto-celtic is a descendant of the proto-indo-european language and is itself the ancestor of the celtic languages which are members of the modern indo-european language family , the most commonly spoken language family . modern celtic languages share common features with italic languages that are unseen in other branches and according to one theory they may have formed an ancient italo-celtic branch . belfast celtic football club was a football club in ireland -lrb- now northern ireland -rrb- that was founded in 1891 , and was one of the most successful teams in ireland until it withdrew permanently from the irish league in 1949 . it left the league for political reasons , as the team and its supporters were largely catholic and irish nationalist , and its players had been violently attacked by a mob against its main rival linfield in december 1948 . belfast celtic were one of four clubs that attracted the biggest crowds in the irish league , the other three being linfield , distillery , and glentoran . celtic frost -lrb- -rrb- were a swiss extreme metal band from zürich . they are known for their strong influence on the development of extreme metal and avant-garde metal . formed in 1981 as hellhammer , the band became celtic frost in 1984 and released their debut , morbid tales , that year . this was followed by to mega therion -lrb- 1985 -rrb- and the highly experimental into the pandemonium -lrb- 1987 -rrb- , all of which were widely praised .
in 1973 , king 's novel carrie was accepted by publishing house doubleday . carrie was king 's fourth novel , but it was the first to be published . it was written on a portable typewriter that belonged to his wife . the novel began as a short story intended for cavalier magazine , but king tossed the first three pages of his work in the garbage can . king has called richard matheson `` the author who influenced me most as a writer . '' in a current edition of matheson 's the shrinking man , king is quoted as saying , `` a horror story if there ever was one ... a great adventure story -- it is certainly one of that select handful that i have given to people , envying them the experience of the first reading . '' in his short story collection a century of great suspense stories , editor jeffery deaver noted that king `` singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up . while there were many good best-selling writers before him , king , more than anybody since john d. macdonald , brought reality to genre novels . he has often remarked that ` salem 's lot was `` peyton place meets dracula . and so it was .
casanova was cared for by his grandmother marzia baldissera while his mother toured about europe in the theater . his father died when he was eight . as a child , casanova suffered nosebleeds , and his grandmother sought help from a witch : `` leaving the gondola , we enter a hovel , where we find an old woman sitting on a pallet , with a black cat in her arms and five or six others around her .

gwen ihnat of the a.v. club wrote a positive review giving the series a `` b + '' grade . she observed that `` what weird loners has in its corner is an appealing cast and some hard-hitting tv vets '' and remarked that `` since kasdan and weithorn both know their way around a sitcom set , it 's not a surprise that weird loners soon adds more gravity than most new shows boast from right out of the gate .

at the tournament in indian wells , california , in march , davenport made history by defeating world no. 3 maria sharapova , 6 -- 0 , 6 -- 0 . it marked the first time that a player ranked in the top 3 had ever been `` shut out '' on the wta tour and was the first time sharapova had failed to win a game during a match . this turned out to be davenport 's only career victory against sharapova . davenport married jon leach , a morgan stanley investment banker and former university of southern california all-american tennis player , on april 25 , 2003 in hawaii . jon leach is the brother of her former coach rick leach . davenport took a break from competitive tennis in late 2006 and much of 2007 to have a baby . in 2007 , she gave birth to a son in newport beach , california . at the first grand slam tournament of the year , the australian open , davenport lost in the second round to eventual champion maria sharapova , 1 -- 6 , 3 -- 6 . this was the first time that davenport had lost to sharapova in straight sets .
early voting is a tricky indicator for predicting elections , since it 's hard to know whether voters who cast ballots early would have voted anyway on election day but are simply doing it sooner -- or if they represent new voters altogether . but one thing is clear : the share of younger people voting early in texas and georgia is far outpacing anything seen at this point during the last midterm election , in 2014 . the trend holds for both those voters aged 18-30 and those 30-50 . and while the share of younger voters has gone up so far , the percentage of seniors over 65 voting early , even though they are still the largest single bloc of early voters in either state , their overall share has fallen sharply . republican brian kemp says he will not recuse himself as georgia 's chief elections officer even if his gubernatorial race with democrat stacey abrams goes to a recount . the first question posed to the two-term georgia secretary of state , asked by a debate moderator tuesday night in atlanta , drove at an issue that has drawn national attention to the campaign : accusations today , and from over the past eight years , that kemp has sought to suppress the minority vote . `` we 've got a very competent elections team to oversee that -lrb- recount -rrb- process , '' kemp said , and in a nod to the microscope now on the state , added : `` i 'm certain that there would be a lot of people watching that . '' with only 14 days to go before election day and early voting now in its second week , the contest to replace term-limited gop gov. kemp retained his office as georgia secretary of state throughout the campaign , leading to allegations of a conflict of interest for overseeing an election in which kemp himself was a candidate . during the campaign , he was called upon by former president jimmy carter and the georgia chapters of the naacp and common cause , to resign . kemp refused to do so until after he 'd claimed victory , two days after the election . kemp also accused the state democratic party of hacking into the state 's voter database a few days before the election ; however , an email released shortly after the accusation was made showed the party warning election security experts , highlighting `` massive '' vulnerabilities within the state 's my voter page and its online voter registration system , not an attempt to hack the database , as kemp had claimed .
the news of the trials ' results not only assured the soling 's status , but stimulated a building spree : three hundred in 1968 and as many or more in 1969 . elvstrøm became the dominant builder in europe , particularly after he won the first soling world championships off copenhagen in 1969 . one of the best american helmsman , george o'day , was given a license to build for the us market , just as bill abbott sr. -lrb- chief -rrb- acquired the canadian market . americans are nationals and citizens of the united states of america . although nationals and citizens make up the majority of americans , some dual citizens , expatriates , and permanent residents may also claim american nationality . the united states is home to people of many different ethnic origins . as a result , american culture and law does not equate nationality with race or ethnicity , but with citizenship and permanent allegiance . the international soling class is still very active . yearly world , continental and many national championships are organized and well visited . fleetsracing with more than 40 competing boats are no exception . local club racing is also very popular in the soling .
in december 2004 , the homeland security advisory council voted to review the color-coded system . one panel member suggested that it had outlived its usefulness . in a public forum , ridge conceded the system had invited `` questions and even occasional derision . '' ridge also said that he had not always agreed when others pushed to raise the threat level . the alert level was raised once in 2004 , an election year , leading some critics to speculate that the bush administration used them for political rather than strictly security reasons . in 2009 , ridge alleged in his book the test of our times : america under siege ... and how we can be safe again that top aides to president bush -lrb- including defense secretary donald rumsfeld and attorney general john ashcroft -rrb- pressured him to raise the alert level on the eve of the november 2004 presidential election . ridge refused . `` after that episode , i knew i had to follow through with my plans to leave the federal government for the private sector , '' he said . the system was created by homeland security presidential directive 3 on march 11 , 2002 , in response to the september 11 attacks . it was meant to provide a `` comprehensive and effective means to disseminate information regarding the risk of terrorist acts to federal , state , and local authorities and to the american people . '' it was unveiled march 12 , 2002 , by tom ridge , then the assistant to the president for homeland security . however , responsibility for developing , implementing and managing the system was given to the u.s. attorney general .
sterling `` red '' quinlan served as the station 's general manager from the early 1950s to the mid-1960s , and became a giant in early chicago television . quinlan was instrumental in starting the careers of tom duggan , frank reynolds and bob newhart . the station courageously aired the tom duggan show in the mid-1950s , which became the most popular show in the chicago market , far outdrawing other network competition . channel 7 had its call letters changed to wls-tv on october 7 , 1968 , named after wls radio , which abc had wholly owned since 1959 when the network bought the 50 % interest it did not already hold in the station from the prairie farmer magazine . clark has appeared on a variety of talk shows including : the tonight show , good morning america , cbs morning news , today , `` the ticket '' , and live with regis and kathy lee . he has also appeared on the cover of tv guide and numerous other magazines . by 1983 , a disastrous anchor change had dropped channel 7 into third place . this prompted two major changes to the station 's management ; abc brought in dennis swanson from wls-tv 's los angeles sister station kabc-tv to serve as the station 's new general manager . swanson , in turn , hired bill applegate as the station 's news director . in addition , abc commissioned frank gari to compose an updated version of the cool hand luke `` tar sequence '' theme widely associated with the eyewitness news format .
on november 17 , 2017 , the pipeline leaked what the company claimed was 210,000 gallons of oil onto farmland near amherst , south dakota . the oil leak is the largest seen from the keystone pipeline in the state . the leak lasted for several minutes , with no initial reports of damage to water sources or wildlife . although the spill did not happen on sioux property , it was in close enough proximity to potentially contaminate the aquifer used for water . in september 2016 , senator bernie sanders spoke to a crowd of about 3,000 members of the standing rock sioux tribe and other tribal nations and supporters at a protest held outside of the white house . saying `` the pipeline threatens the environment and water resources and exploits native americans '' , he asked president obama to take action and conduct a full environmental and cultural impact analysis of the project , which he believed would kill the pipeline . following the use of the national guard and police in riot gear to remove protesters from a protest camp in october , sanders again called on the president to suspend construction of the pipeline . in a letter to the president , sanders said in part : `` it is deeply distressing to me that the federal government is putting the profits of the oil industry ahead of the treaty and sovereign rights of native american communities . in a february 2015 , the us epa responded to the u.s. department of state 's final supplemental environmental impact statement -lrb- final seis -rrb- -rsb- for the keystone xl pipeline project , that the pipeline will significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions because it will lead to the expansion of alberta 's carbon intensive oilsands . and that over the proposed 50-year timeline of the pipeline , this could mean releasing as much as `` 1.37 billion more tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere '' . epa concluded that due to the current relatively cheap cost of oil , companies might be less likely to set up their own developments in the oil sands . it would be too expensive for the companies to ship by rail .
`` gee , golly , gosh , gloriosky , '' thought mary sue as she stepped on the bridge of the enterprise . `` here i am , the youngest lieutenant in the fleet - only fifteen and a half years old . '' captain kirk came up to her . before meeting obama , michelle had told her mother she intended to focus solely on her career . the couple 's first date was to spike lee 's movie do the right thing -lrb- 1989 -rrb- . barack obama has said that the couple had an `` opposites attract '' scenario in their initial interest in each other , since michelle had stability from her two-parent home while he was `` adventurous '' . they married on october 3 , 1992 . michelle ingrid williams was born on september 9 , 1980 , in kalispell , montana , to carla , a homemaker , and larry r. williams , an author and commodities trader . she is of norwegian descent . her father twice ran unsuccessfully for the united states senate as a republican party nominee . in kalispell , williams lived with her three paternal half-siblings and her younger sister , paige .

during the late 16th and 17th centuries , the figure of the `` savage '' -- and later , increasingly , the `` good savage '' -- was held up as a reproach to european civilization , then in the throes of the french wars of religion and thirty years ' war . in his famous essay `` of cannibals '' -lrb- 1580 -rrb- , michel de montaigne -- himself a catholic -- reported that the tupinambá people of brazil ceremoniously eat the bodies of their dead enemies as a matter of honour . however , he reminded his readers that europeans behave even more barbarously when they burn each other alive for disagreeing about religion -lrb- he implies -rrb- : `` one calls ` barbarism ' whatever he is not accustomed to . '' terence cave comments : reacting to the wars of religion of his own time and the previous century , he maintained that the absolute rule of a king was the only possible alternative to the otherwise inevitable violence and disorder of civil war . hobbes ' hard primitivism may have been as venerable as the tradition of soft primitivism , but his use of it was new . he used it to argue that the state was founded on a social contract in which men voluntarily gave up their liberty in return for the peace and security provided by total surrender to an absolute ruler , whose legitimacy stemmed from the social contract and not from god . lisa and joe 's marriage was all but over . after his return from iraq , they optimistically went about forging a life together . they married in 2009 , got good jobs and moved into a nice house on long island , new york . for lisa , the war was the past .
the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical , geographical , and political context in which it is used . american is derived from america , a term originally denoting all of the new world -lrb- also called the americas -rrb- . in some expressions , it retains this pan-american sense , but its usage has evolved over time and , for various historical reasons , the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america . in modern english , american generally refers to persons or things related to the united states of america ; among native english speakers this usage is almost universal , with any other use of the term requiring specification . ibtihaj muhammad will leave rio de janeiro as more than an olympic medalist -- she 'll leave as a history maker . the fencer was the first american athlete to compete in the olympics while wearing a hijab . she then became the first american woman to earn a medal at the olympics while wearing a hijab when her team took home the bronze . `` this has been a beautiful experience , '' muhammad told chris cuomo on tuesday on cnn 's `` new day .

tate has commented on these controversies in relation to the queensrÿche lawsuits , saying : `` i guess that 's the nature of being in a lawsuit . now you have to watch what you say , and trust that who you are talking to does the right thing , you know , and push the information out in the way that it happened . and not try to construct something different , you know ? '' in 2013 , lead singer geoff tate explained the band 's dissatisfaction with the album 's mix : `` the only time i ever experienced was during the recording of queensrÿche 's first album , the warning . we went $ 300,000 over budget and the label took the record out of our hands and gave it to someone else to mix . ... the guy that mixed the album had no clue what queensrÿche was . `` a world without '' is about a man whose wife dies during childbirth , and explores what happens to us when we pass away , touching on topics such as reincarnation . the song includes many metaphors ; for example , in the second verse : `` the guy is smoking a cigarette , and the wife becomes the cigarette , and she 's the smoke he 's breathing in . so , she 's closer to him in this way then she ever could be in the flesh . -lrb- ... -rrb- .

after winning the election , trump said in a nov. 12 , 2016 television interview that , as president , his use of social media would be `` very restrained , if i use it at all . '' he did reduce his number of tweets during his early time in office . since then , however , he has increased his use of twitter . for example , he tweeted over 1,000 times during the month of october 2019 while the impeachment inquiry was underway . a woman known as juror b37 thought writing an anonymous book about her experiences on the george zimmerman trial was a good idea . many people , including a powerful and tireless group of outraged twitter users , thought otherwise . news reports surfaced monday morning that the woman , who gave an exclusive interview that night with cnn 's anderson cooper about her experiences on the six-woman zimmerman jury , had signed with a literary agent and was working on a book proposal about the trial . the agent was identified as sharlene martin , who has worked on such other post-trial tomes as o.j. donald trump has used twitter as a method of providing ideas and information during his presidential campaign in 2016 , the transitional period and as us president . a study performed at rose-hulman institute of technology showed his tweets from these different time periods and through analysis of his tweets , the professors found that president trump uses a mode called `` forensic mode '' the most often in his tweets . this is described as a quick reactive usage , as they found he often used twitter to show his judgement of the events that occurred regarding both his allies and his enemies . after his election to the presidency he tweeted this `` forensic-style '' tweet , `` just had a very open and successful election .
dozens of children at a utah elementary school had their lunch trays snatched away from them before they could take a bite this week . salt lake city school district officials say the trays were taken away at uintah elementary school tuesday because some students had negative balances in the accounts used to pay for lunches . but they admit the situation should have been handled differently . instead of regular lunches , the students were given fruit and milk . an 18-year-old florida student is set to return to class wednesday after he says he was suspended when school officials learned of his pornographic online photos and videos . robert marucci , a senior at cocoa high school in cocoa , florida , told cnn affiliate wkmg that he picked up his x-rated gig to help his mom pay the bills . his mom , melyssa lieb , said when students discovered the explicit material online , her son became a target . `` he was bullied , he was threatened .

the united states has concluded syria carried out chemical weapons attacks against its people , president barack obama said wednesday , a claim that comes amid a looming diplomatic showdown over whether to strike against bashar al-assad 's military . obama 's declaration to `` pbs newshour '' came at the end of a day that saw russia and china walk out of a u.n. security council meeting as word surfaced britain planned to pursue a resolution to authorize the use of force against syria , even as united nations weapons inspectors were in syria assessing whether chemical weapons have been used . `` we do not believe that , given the delivery systems , using rockets , that the opposition could have carried out these attacks . we have concluded that the syrian government in fact carried these out , '' obama told `` newshour . '' -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the united states respects the vote by the british parliament not to participate in a potential military action against syria , u.s. secretary of defense chuck hagel said friday . `` every nation has a responsibility to make their own decisions , and we respect that of any nation , '' he told journalists in manila , the philippines . in spite of the british decision , it remains the goal of the obama administration that any decision be `` an international collaboration , '' he said . -lrb- cnn -rrb- the united states may have to take action against syria without the support of one of its staunchest allies , u.s. officials said thursday after british lawmakers voted down a proposal for military action . saying `` there is no doubt who is responsible for this heinous use of chemical weapons attack in syria : the syrian regime , '' vice president joe biden signaled tuesday that the united states -- with its allies -- was ready to act . `` those who use chemical weapons against defenseless men , women and children should and must be held accountable , '' biden said in a speech to the american legion . the vice president 's remarks echo those made by other u.s. officials in recent days , as well as many of the nation 's foremost allies . french president francois hollande said his administration was `` ready to punish those who made the decision to gas these innocent people , '' adding that `` everything leads us to believe '' that syrian president bashar al-assad 's forces are responsible .

the laboratory schools were founded by american educator john dewey in 1896 in the hyde park neighborhood of chicago . calvin brainerd cady was director of the music department under dewey . the school began as a progressive educational institution that goes from nursery school through 12th grade . this experiment was an integral part of the university of chicago during the years 1896 to 1904 , and was an undertaking which aimed to work put , through the university , a school system which should be an organic whole from the kindergarten to the university . water fluoridation has been hailed by the us centers for disease control and prevention as one of the top great public health achievements of the 20th century , but a new study raises questions about its role as a potential neurotoxin in utero . the study , published in the journal jama pediatrics on monday , found that increased levels of fluoride exposure during pregnancy were associated with declines in iq in children . previous research has made similar findings , but this is the first such study to evaluate the effect of fluoride on populations receiving what the us public health service considers optimal levels of 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of drinking water , such as in the united states and canada . the authors of the new study assessed 601 canadian mother and child pairs , tracking the fluoride exposure of 512 of the mothers by looking at the average concentration of fluoride in urine samples taken throughout their pregnancies as a proxy for prenatal fluoride exposure . run jointly by the university 's woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs and the department of psychology , the program was planned with the intent of being a `` discipline plus '' degree . the growing interest in the incorporation of psychology in law schools and public policy schools is another reason why the program was established . such interest is evidenced by the fact that five members of the department of psychology 's faculty have an additional appointment at the woodrow wilson school and the fact that the department is one of the sponsors of the princeton graduate student conference on psychology and policymaking .
on february 10 , 2016 , fiorina suspended her presidential campaign due to weak results in iowa and new hampshire . she received two percent of the votes in the iowa caucuses and four percent of the votes in the new hampshire primary . on march 9 , she formally endorsed ted cruz for president . goodbye , iowa . the center of political gravity shifted east on tuesday as presidential campaigns turned their focus to next week 's new hampshire primary . for donald trump , who claimed a disappointing second-place finish in iowa on monday night , the granite state will be an opportunity for redemption . for several republicans , new hampshire on february 9 will be the make or break contest of the 2016 primary . a candidate for the united states senate in 2010 , fiorina ruled out running for the u.s. senate in 2016 , but did not rule out running for president in 2016 . in november 2014 , the washington post reported that fiorina was `` actively exploring '' a run for president . her business background and status as the only ceo and the only woman in a `` sea of suited men '' were mentioned as positives , with republican strategists pointing to her unsuccessful 2010 senate campaign , unpaid campaign debt and dismissal from hp as `` considerable challenges .

world aids day , designated on 1 december every year since 1988 , is an international day dedicated to raising awareness of the aids pandemic caused by the spread of hiv infection and mourning those who have died of the disease . government and health officials , non-governmental organizations , and individuals around the world observe the day , often with education on aids prevention and control . additionally , aids service organizations provide resources beyond medical services . the lack of knowledge about aids and the resulting panic and misinformation was the motivating force behind many community service organizations who worked to provide education and dispel myths about the disease . this continues to be an enormous issue today and is one of the most important services aids organizations provides . they also can provide community health and wellness education , personal and family counseling , healthy sexuality and sexually transmitted infection prevention awareness , safe sex materials , and legal advice and services . spreading awareness about aids also began to take place in other locations . across canada aids awareness week is the last week in november . in 2002 , the canadian public health association -lrb- cpha -rrb- led a bilingual campaign for their awareness week from november 24-december 1 , 2002 . this campaign was centered on ending the stigma and discrimination against people who have hiv/aids .
once hitler was appointed chancellor by german president paul von hindenburg , he quickly made efforts to manipulate the aging president . on 28 february 1933 , hitler convinced hindenburg to declare a state of emergency which suspended all civil liberties throughout germany , due at least in part to the reichstag fire the night before . hitler assured hindenburg throughout that he was attempting to stabilize the tumultuous political scene in germany by taking a `` defensive measure against communist acts of violence endangering the state . '' wasting no time , himmler set the sd in motion as they began creating an extensive card-index of the nazi regime 's political opponents , arresting labor organizers , socialists , jewish leaders , journalists , and communists in the process , sending them to the newly-established prison facility near munich , dachau . in 1997 , brandon sued the singer boy george for malicious falsehood and lost . george revealed details of his love for brandon and their romantic and sexual affair in his 1995 autobiography take it like a man . brandon claimed that stories about the gay affair in the early 1980s damaged his career as a musician . he also objected to the lyrics of a boy george song , `` unfinished business '' , which apparently were aimed at him : `` i hear you married a danish girl ... you break your promise easily ... you lie , you lie , you lie . because we do n't know when we will die , we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well . and yet everything happens only a certain number of times , and a very small number really . how many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood , an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you ca n't even conceive of your life without it ? perhaps four , or five times more ?
the first best actor awarded was emil jannings , for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh . he had to return to europe before the ceremony , so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier ; this made him the first academy award winner in history . at that time , winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period ; for example , jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period , and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films . with the fourth ceremony , however , the system changed , and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film . film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for best picture , in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season . the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified . it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders . for example , a producer of the 2009 best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner -lrb- the hurt locker eventually won -rrb- . casey affleck will not be presenting the best actress award at this year 's oscar ceremony . it 's academy tradition for the previous year 's best actor winner to present the best actress oscar . affleck won the best actor award in 2017 for his role in `` manchester by the sea .

the approaching era of jet travel , and a series of midair collisions -lrb- most notable was the 1956 grand canyon mid-air collision -rrb- prompted passage of the federal aviation act of 1958 . this legislation gave the caa 's functions to a new independent body , the federal aviation agency . the act transferred air safety regulation from the cab to the new faa , and also gave the faa sole responsibility for a common civil-military system of air navigation and air traffic control . the faa 's first administrator , elwood r. quesada , was a former air force general and adviser to president eisenhower . president franklin d. roosevelt split the authority into two agencies in 1940 : the civil aeronautics administration -lrb- caa -rrb- and the civil aeronautics board -lrb- cab -rrb- . caa was responsible for atc , airman and aircraft certification , safety enforcement , and airway development . cab was entrusted with safety regulation , accident investigation , and economic regulation of the airlines . the caa was part of the department of commerce . the federal aviation act of 1958 was an act of the united states congress , signed by president dwight d. eisenhower , that created the federal aviation agency -lrb- later the federal aviation administration or the faa -rrb- and abolished its predecessor , the civil aeronautics administration -lrb- caa -rrb- . the act empowered the faa to oversee and regulate safety in the airline industry and the use of american airspace by both military aircraft and civilian aircraft .

a series of deadly bombings claimed more than a dozen lives in iraq saturday , according to police and health officials . seven people were killed and 28 others wounded when three roadside bombs exploded mid-morning in the busy bab al-sharji commercial district of central baghdad , police officials said . another six men died and 10 others were injured when a roadside bomb hit a minibus carrying young laborers and construction workers in al-annaz area in eastern falluja , health and police officials said . the blast occurred at about 5.30 a.m. local time in what is a predominately sunni area . at least 13 people were killed monday when a suicide bomber drove his vehicle into a security checkpoint at a prison in the taji district of baghdad , police officials said . twenty-eight others were injured in the attack , including prison guards and civilians . an investigation is ongoing into the bombing . no groups have yet claimed responsibility , but the attack bears the hallmarks of al qaeda in iraq . u.s. vice president joe biden paid tribute thursday to the sacrifices of u.s. and iraqi troops at a ceremony for service members from both nations . he and iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki addressed about 120 u.s. service members and 100 iraqi troops gathered at al-faw palace , the baghdad edifice that once belonged to dictator saddam hussein . the trip came amid a u.s. military withdrawal from the middle eastern country . virtually all american troops are scheduled to be out by the end of the year .
as part of the 2018 trump administration 's zero tolerance policy , nearly 3,000 minors were separated from their parents , or the adults accompanying them , while trying to illegally cross the u.s.-mexico border and placed in detention camps . rolling stone likened these centers to `` prisons '' while the houston chronicle reported that a movement swelled online to call them `` concentration camps . '' similarly , former first lady of the united states laura bush compared the images of the centers to u.s. japanese internment camps during the second world war . 16 out of 34 of the centers located in texas had previously been cited by texas officials for more than 150 health violations . immigration and customs enforcement , or ice , is the organisation responsible for enforcing immigration laws within american territory , focusing largely on removing individuals who entered the country unlawfully . immigration and nationality act section 287 -lrb- g -rrb- allows ice to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies , permitting designated officers to perform immigration law enforcement functions , pursuant to a memorandum of agreement -lrb- moa -rrb- , provided that the local law enforcement officers receive appropriate training and function under the supervision of sworn u.s. immigration and customs enforcement officers . under 287 -lrb- g -rrb- , ice provides state and local law enforcement with the training and subsequent authorisation to identify , process , and when appropriate , detain immigration offenders they encounter during their regular , daily law-enforcement activity . the 287 -lrb- g -rrb- program is extremely controversial ; it has been widely criticised for increasing racist profiling by police and undermining community safety because unlawful immigrant communities are no longer willing to report crimes or talk to law enforcement . the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- is a federal law enforcement agency under the u.s. department of homeland security , principally responsible for immigration and customs enforcement , with additional responsibilities in countering transnational crime.ice 's mission is to protect america from the cross-border crime and illegal immigration that threaten national security and public safety . this mission is executed through the enforcement of more than 400 federal statutes and focuses on smart immigration enforcement , preventing terrorism and combating the illegal movement of people and goods . ice has two primary components : homeland security investigations -lrb- hsi -rrb- and enforcement and removal operations -lrb- ero -rrb- . ice maintains attachés at major u.s. diplomatic missions overseas .
the macintosh was too radical for some , who labeled it a mere `` toy '' . because the machine was entirely designed around the gui , existing text-mode and command-driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten ; this was a challenging undertaking that many software developers shied away from , and resulted in an initial lack of software for the new system . in april 1984 microsoft 's multiplan migrated over from ms-dos , followed by microsoft word in january 1985 . in 1985 , lotus software introduced lotus jazz after the success of lotus 1-2-3 for the ibm pc , although it was largely a flop . apple computer company was founded on april 1 , 1976 , by steve jobs , steve wozniak , and ronald wayne as a business partnership . the company 's first product is the apple i , a computer designed and hand-built entirely by wozniak , and first shown to the public at the homebrew computer club . apple i was sold as a motherboard -lrb- with cpu , ram , and basic textual-video chips -rrb- -- a base kit concept which would now not be marketed as a complete personal computer . the apple i went on sale in july 1976 and was market-priced at $ 666.66 -lrb- $ 2,995 in 2019 dollars , adjusted for inflation -rrb- . according to wozniak , jobs proposed the name `` apple computer '' when he had just come back from robert friedland 's all-one farm in oregon . jobs told walter isaacson that he was `` on one of my fruitarian diets , '' when he conceived of the name , and thought `` it sounded fun , spirited and not intimidating ... plus , it would get us ahead of atari in the phone book .

the us publisher ward 's estimates that as of 2010 , there were 1.015 billion motor vehicles in use in the world . this figure represents the number of cars , trucks -lrb- light , medium and heavy duty -rrb- , and buses , but does not include off-road vehicles or heavy construction equipment . the world vehicle population passed the 500 million-unit mark in 1986 , from 250 million motor vehicles in 1970 . between 1950 and 1970 , the vehicle population doubled roughly every 10 years . in the united states , a department of motor vehicles -lrb- dmv -rrb- is a state-level government agency that administers vehicle registration and driver licensing . similar departments exist in canada under different names . the name `` dmv '' is not used in every state or area , nor are the traditional dmv functions handled by a single agency in every state , but the generic term is widely understood , particularly in the context of driver 's license issuance and renewal . in the united states , a department of motor vehicles -lrb- dmv -rrb- is a state-level government agency that administers vehicle registration and driver licensing . similar departments exist in canada under different names . the name `` dmv '' is not used in every state or area , nor are the traditional dmv functions handled by a single agency in every state , but the generic term is widely understood , particularly in the context of driver 's license issuance and renewal .
in 1996 , actress hunter tylo was cast in melrose place and opted to leave daytime soap opera the bold and the beautiful to take the role . however , she was fired by melrose place producer aaron spelling prior to filming any episodes for the series , when she announced she was pregnant . the character she was to play , taylor mcbride , was recast , lisa rinna taking the role . tylo quickly returned to the bold and the beautiful . karath has said she still is not fond of water after nearly drowning in the boat scene in the sound of music , as she could not swim . the concept of bones was developed during the latter part of the pitching season of 2004 when 20th century fox approached series creator hart hanson with an idea for a forensics show . hanson was asked to meet with executive producer barry josephson , who had purchased the rights to produce a documentary on the forensic anthropologist and author kathy reichs . although hanson was reluctant about being involved in making a police procedural , he signed on and wrote the pilot episode after having an intensive meeting with josephson about the show . as the show is based on the works of reichs , the writers constantly involve her in the process of producing the episodes ' story lines .
this is week five of an ongoing series : a catholic reads the bible . read week one , week two , week three and week four . you better choose to follow god , or else . for the first time in this journey of reading the bible , god scared me . last september , i made my first visit to north korea , granted a rare glimpse of what goes on beyond the demilitarized zone , in one of the most mysterious places on earth . now , eight months on , the regime has invited me to return to the reclusive nation where foreign visitors -- especially journalists -- are seldom welcomed . last time around i learned to get used to the government minders who stuck by our side , ensuring we only saw what the government wanted us to see . i know they 'll be there again this time , waiting for us when we land in pyongyang . for the first time in two decades , cisco will have a ceo not named john chambers . cisco on monday announced that longtime executive chuck robbins will replace chambers as the company 's chief executive . robbins will officially take the networking company 's reins on july 26 , and he was named as one of the company 's directors . though the move is n't exactly a shock -- rumors of chambers stepping down have been ongoing for years -- it 's hard to imagine the company being led by someone else .
of the three artists who won all four awards , two of them won all four at once : christopher cross in 1980 , and billie eilish in 2020 making her the youngest artist to do so at the age of 18 . adele won the best new artist award in 2009 and the other three in 2012 and 2017 . christopher cross and billie eilish are the only main artists to receive the grammys for album of the year as well as for record of the year , song of the year , and best new artist in one ceremony . adele is the first artist to receive the award for album of the year , record of the year , song of the year , and best new artist , nonconsecutively , and first woman to accomplish this feat . only five artists have won both album of the year and best new artist in the same year : bob newhart in 1961 , christopher cross in 1981 , lauryn hill in 1999 , norah jones in 2003 and billie eilish in 2020 . of the 54 awards presented in the category since its inception , the honor has been presented to 26 solo female artists , 18 duos or groups , and 11 solo male artists . between 1997 and 2003 , all the winners were solo female artists . also , from 1993 to 2005 , no winner was a solo male artist . in 2006 , john legend broke this trend , which started with marc cohn in 1992 .
the united states postal service -lrb- usps ; also known as the post office , u.s. mail , or postal service -rrb- is an independent agency of the executive branch of the united states federal government responsible for providing postal service in the united states , including its insular areas and associated states . it is one of the few government agencies explicitly authorized by the united states constitution . the usps traces its roots to 1775 during the second continental congress , when benjamin franklin was appointed the first postmaster general . the post office department was created in 1792 with the passage of the postal service act . obligations of the uso include uniform prices , quality of service , access to services , and six-day delivery to every part of the country . to assure financial support for these obligations , the postal monopoly provides the postal service the exclusive right to deliver letters and restricts mailbox access solely for mail . the report argued that eliminating or reducing either aspect of the monopoly `` would have a devastating impact on the ability ... to provide the affordable universal service that the country values so highly '' . relaxing access to the mailbox would also pose security concerns , increase delivery costs , and hurt customer service , according to the post office . in july 2011 , the usps announced a plan to close about 3,700 small post offices . various representatives in congress protested , and the senate passed a bill that would have kept open all post offices farther than 10 miles from the next office . in may 2012 , the service announced it had modified its plan . instead , rural post offices would remain open with reduced retail hours -lrb- some as little as two hours per day -rrb- unless there was a community preference for a different option .
president donald trump likes to boast that he is the most popular republican president among republicans that has ever existed . `` how do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time , done nothing wrong -lrb- no collusion with russia , it was the dems that colluded -rrb- , had the most successful first two years of any president , and is the most popular republican in party history 93 % ? '' he tweeted earlier this month . that may be changing , at least according to a new washington post-abc news poll that shows 1 in 3 republican and republican-leaning voters would like the gop to nominate `` someone other '' than trump in 2020 . the washington post recently reported that howard schultz , the former ceo and chairman of starbucks , is seriously mulling a presidential run as a third-party candidate . that the former coffee executive is considering an afterlife in politics is not new news -- his name has been bandied about on numerous lists of high-profile corporate and celebrity outsiders who might take on donald trump in 2020 -- but up until now , much of that speculation assumed that schultz would run as a democrat . the history of successful third-party presidential bids in modern american history is the shortest of lists -- with precisely zero entries -- but the `` sui generis '' dynamics of the 2020 contest could possibly create a once-in-a-generation opening for a schultz presidential gambit . for this to play out in schultz 's favor , a few factors will have to align -- some of which , as far as schultz and his advisers are concerned , are completely outside their control . president carter was challenged by ted kennedy for his re-election bid in the democratic presidential primary . carter would later write that the ongoing iran hostage crisis impacted the latter 's choice to rely on rosalynn among others in his administration to advocate for his policies on the campaign trail . vice president mondale would come to view himself and rosalynn as president carter 's proxies through much of the spring portion of the election cycle . rosalynn would reflect that the iowa victory of the carter re-election campaign , which saw president carter defeat kennedy 59.16 % to 31.23 % , made attacks by kennedy easier for her to not be bothered by .
in the people 's republic of china , the ministry of health is responsible for occupational disease prevention and the state administration of work safety for safety issues at work . on the provincial and municipal level , there are health supervisions for occupational health and local bureaus of work safety for safety . the `` occupational disease control act of prc '' came into force on may 1 , 2002 . and work safety act of prc on november 1 , 2002 . the occupational disease control act is under revision . in the uk , health and safety legislation is drawn up and enforced by the health and safety executive and local authorities -lrb- the local council -rrb- under the health and safety at work etc. . act 1974 -lrb- hasawa -rrb- . hasawa introduced -lrb- section 2 -rrb- a general duty on an employer to ensure , so far as is reasonably practicable , the health , safety and welfare at work of all his employees ; with the intention of giving a legal framework supporting ` codes of practice ' not in themselves having legal force but establishing a strong presumption as to what was reasonably practicable -lrb- deviations from them could be justified by appropriate risk assessment -rrb- . the previous reliance on detailed prescriptive rule-setting was seen as having failed to respond rapidly enough to technological change , leaving new technologies potentially un-regulated or inappropriately regulated . a fire that engulfed a philadelphia refinery and sparked air-quality concerns has been extinguished , according to city officials . the fire at philadelphia energy solutions was put out on saturday afternoon , according to a statement on the city 's website . the fire began with an explosion on friday morning from a vat of butane and propane . residents reportedly felt the explosion in south jersey and delaware county , pennsylvania , according to cnn affiliate wpvi .
people later reported on the circumstances leading up to the publication of `` black like me ? '' selle had learned of dolezal 's allegation that a package containing racist threats against her was delivered to the post office box of the spokane , washington , naacp . selle recalled that dolezal had made similar allegations when she was living in coeur d'alene , and that the allegations were not substantiated . sensing a potential story , selle discovered that dolezal had identified wilkerson as her father ; when contacted , wilkerson contradicted this assertion . osbourne 's increasingly temperamental and erratic behavior prompts katie to change the locks on their house and invite harry to move in . it is shown that harry is a womanizer and katie is not the only `` other '' woman he 's seeing , as he routinely goes on dates to have flings with women he meets online . he coincidentally starts seeing linda litzke after meeting her from the dating site . kirk honeycutt of the hollywood reporter stated , `` for an `` entertainment , '' warrior accomplishes a lot . the family drama resonates strongly with a resolution that , in retrospect , seems like the only way the brothers could have rediscovered blood ties .

at the time of her husband coming under consideration for the vice presidential nomination , pat nixon was against her husband accepting the selection , as she despised campaigns and had been relieved that as a newly elected senator he would not have another one for six years . she thought she had prevailed in convincing him , until she heard the announcement of the pick from a news bulletin while at the 1952 republican national convention . during the presidential campaign of 1952 , pat nixon 's attitude toward politics changed when her husband was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions . pat encouraged him to fight the charges , and he did so by delivering the famed `` checkers speech '' , so-called for the family 's dog , a cocker spaniel given to them by a political supporter . it has been said that few , if any , first ladies worked as consistently before marrying as did pat nixon . as she told the writer gloria steinem during the 1968 presidential campaign , `` i never had time to think about things like that -- who i wanted to be , or who i admired , or to have ideas . i never had time to dream about being anyone else . i had to work . '' outgoing us ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said she used president donald trump 's `` unpredictable '' behavior to her advantage in order to `` get the job done '' as ambassador . `` he would ratchet up the rhetoric , and then i 'd go back to the ambassadors and say ` you know , he 's pretty upset . i ca n't promise you what he 's going to do or not , but i can tell you if we do these sanctions , it will keep him from going too far , ' '' haley told nbc 's craig melvin in an interview that aired wednesday on nbc 's `` today .

judge richard leon issued a stinging rebuke on tuesday to the justice department 's attempt to block at&t 's $ 85 billion bid to acquire time warner . but that does n't mean the case is over . the justice department can appeal the ruling , and the department 's antitrust chief , makan delrahim , is considering that option . `` i think the constitution and the statues allow for due process for all litigants and we will take a look at what the next steps are , '' delrahim told reporters outside the courthouse following judge leon 's ruling . two prerequisites are necessary to assess the merits of the department of justice suit to block the merger of at&t and time warner -- which us district judge richard leon resoundingly rejected tuesday . the first is a thorough understanding of antitrust law , in particular the law of vertical integration , the sort of arrangement that at&t and time warner now have a green light to implement . the second is detailed knowledge of the litigation itself , including the 172-page opinion by leon and , especially , the expert testimony at trial on which the judge so thoroughly relied . i have neither . on july 12 , 2018 , the department of justice filed a notice of appeal with the d.c. circuit to reverse the district court 's approval . although the department of justice reportedly contemplated requesting an injunction to stop the deal from closing after the district court 's ruling , the department ultimately did not file the motion because warnermedia 's operation as a separate group from the rest of at&t would make the business relatively easy to unwind should the appeal be successful . the next day , however , at&t ceo randall stephenson told cnbc that the appeal would not affect its plans to integrate warnermedia into at&t , or services already launched .
president barack obama defended the senate intelligence committee 's decision tuesday to release a controversial torture report , arguing that while there was never a `` perfect '' time to release the report , it 's important to publicly admit that the country made mistakes . `` one of the things that sets us apart from other countries is when we make mistakes , we admit them , '' obama said in an interview with `` telemundo '' on tuesday that aired simultaneously on univision . `` we did some things that violated who we are as a people , '' he added . the report , which details the cia 's extreme interrogation techniques used on terrorists after the september 11th attacks , was released by the senate intelligence committee despite a last-minute pleas from secretary of state john kerry and members of congress not to release the information to the public at this time , fearing that its release could spark global attacks against americans . the senate intelligence committee report into the cia 's brutal interrogation tactics against detainees captured after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks is drawing mostly criticism from around the world . while the initial overseas reaction from both united states ' allies as well as its enemies was largely muted , the revelations of the intelligence agency 's use of `` enhanced interrogation techniques '' in the post-9 / 11 era have been widely condemned . the report found cia tactics were more brutal than previously known and accused the agency of keeping the bush white house and congress in the dark . afghanistan afghanistan 's president ashraf ghani condemned the `` inhumane actions '' outlined in the report and told reporters in kabul wednesday that the document `` unfortunately shows that our afghan compatriots had been tortured . '' the cia 's harsh interrogations of terrorist detainees during the bush era did n't work , were more brutal than previously revealed and delivered no `` ticking time bomb '' information that prevented an attack , according to an explosive senate report released tuesday . the majority report issued by the senate intelligence committee is a damning condemnation of the tactics -- branded by critics as torture -- the george w. bush administration deployed in the fear-laden days after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . the techniques , according to the report , were `` deeply flawed , '' poorly managed and often resulted in `` fabricated '' information . the report is reigniting the partisan divide over combating terrorism that dominated washington a decade ago .

elaine hurd , a resident of nearby mesquite nevada , told local television station klas `` i feel that the rule of law supersedes armed militias coming in from all over the country to stand with a law-breaking rancher , which is what he is .

democrats on capitol hill have a message for presidential hopefuls john hickenlooper , the former governor of colorado , and steve bullock , the current governor of montana : you 'd make great senators . hickenlooper and bullock have struggled to gain traction in a crowded field of democratic presidential candidates , but as governors , they have already proven they can be elected statewide . as democrats gear up for a fight for the senate , many are quick to say they believe hickenlooper and bullock would make formidable challengers to republican senators up for re-election in colorado and montana . `` i would urge them to think about this moment in our history and what would be best for the country , '' democratic sen. martin heinrich of new mexico told cnn of hickenlooper and bullock , saying `` no doubt about it , '' when asked if he thinks they would make strong senate candidates and adding that he believes they would make good senators . john hickenlooper , who has struggled to break through the crowded democratic presidential field , spoke to senate minority leader chuck schumer late last week about running for the senate from colorado , a race he has resisted joining but is keeping an open mind about , a top aide tells cnn . `` he is still in the race for president , but he has n't closed the door to anything , '' said peter cunningham , the communications director for the former colorado governor . the latest conversation between hickenlooper and schumer took place in new york , following the cnn presidential debates in detroit . the two have spoken repeatedly about the senate contest , but hickenlooper has been insistent on keeping his presidential campaign alive . the most progressive democratic presidential contenders showed over two nights in detroit that they are ready for an ideological clash to define the party -- and former vice president joe biden showed he is ready to give it to them . the first debate night , tuesday , was all about ideology : sens. elizabeth warren of massachusetts and bernie sanders of vermont spent the night answering to attacks from low-polling moderates like former rep. john delaney of maryland and former colorado gov. john hickenlooper .

the new york state legislature passed a bill on monday that will increase the statute of limitations for cases of child sexual abuse . the child victims act will allow child victims to seek prosecution against their abuser until the age of 55 in civil cases , a significant increase from the previous limit of age 23 . for criminal cases , victims can seek prosecution until they turn 28 . the bill also includes a one-year window during which victims of any age or time limit can come forward to prosecute . `` there is a reckoning going on in this country right now , '' pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro said . `` we have to stand up and say that we 're going to put people before powerful institutions , that we are not going to let -- whether it 's the church , or some university , or hollywood , or politics or business community -- ever put their particular interests above the needs of those that they are supposed to represent and care for , '' shapiro told david axelrod on the axe files , a podcast from the university of chicago institute of politics and cnn . shapiro did just that within his first week as pennsylvania attorney general in 2017 , when he was briefed on grand jury investigations into sexual abuse in the catholic church . he decided to put the `` full force '' of his office behind continuing the investigation . for the first time , pope francis has acknowledged the sexual abuse of nuns by priests and bishops as a `` problem '' in the catholic church , saying that `` we 've been working on this for some time . '' the pope 's comments , which came during a press conference aboard the papal plane on a return flight to rome from the united arab emirates , come as the catholic church is dealing with sexual abuse scandals on several continents . `` there have been priests and also bishops who have done that , '' the pope said of sexually abusing nuns . `` and i believe that it may still be being done .

donald trump 's supporters on capitol hill said thursday they know the stakes are high for monday night 's debate and could set the tone for the sprint to election day . `` donald trump knows , the team knows that monday night is going to be not necessarily make or break , but the momentum coming out of monday night could be critical on both sides and donald trump knows that , '' said rep. chris collins , a new york republican , as he walked out of what could be the final meeting of trump 's congressional supporters . `` he 's likely to bring up some clinton issues . i think we 're going to see some give and take there , '' collins said . hillary clinton is visiting only two battleground states this week -- hardly a sign of confidence at her standing 49 days before the election , but an acknowledgement that one task reigns above all : preparing for her first face-to-face confrontation with donald trump . while she is set to make a quick trip to florida on wednesday , after dipping into pennsylvania on monday , clinton will devote the lion 's share of her time huddling with her debate team , gaming out how she will confront trump next monday night at hofstra university . the lead clinton enjoyed for months in swing state and national polls has all but evaporated , raising the stakes for the first debate . the terrorism investigation in new york and new jersey has also added to the urgency of her first meeting with trump , which will touch on a litany of economic and security issues . in hillary clinton 's eyes , donald trump knows he lost monday night . clinton , speaking with reporters on her plane , threw serious shade at trump hours after the two met for the first presidential debate at hofstra univeristy . the former secretary of state gloated that she had a great night and said trump , who complained about his microphone after the debate , knew he lost . as she walked away from reporters , clinton was asked about trump 's complaints .
the department of education publishes the new jersey school report card as part of an effort to increase school - and district-level accountability for educational progress by providing relevant data to the public that can be used to monitor and measure the performance of schools . while the format and contents of the reports have changed over time , the new jersey school report card has offered the public information about each and every new jersey school since 1995 when the legislature enacted the reporting requirement . in most contemporary educational systems of the world , secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during adolescence . in the united states , canada , and australia , primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as k-12 education , and in new zealand year 1 -- 13 is used . the purpose of secondary education can be to give common knowledge , to prepare for higher education , or to train directly in a profession . this is isced level 1 . primary -lrb- or elementary -rrb- education consists of the first four to seven years of formal , structured education . they are typically designed to provide young children with functional literacy and numeracy skills and to is guaranteed , solid foundation for most areas of knowledge and personal and social development to support the transition to secondary school . in general , primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five to seven , although this varies between , and sometimes within , countries .
the next morning , tim is guilt-ridden and calls vanderhei to confess , before desperately asking her to marry him . after explaining she has been sleeping with other people and desires freedom , she suggests to tim that he take the opportunity to start a new life . tim returns to joan , who attempts to comfort him by telling him what lemke was really like : she was his lover but left him after his sexual appetites became too twisted for her , and he bribed helgesson for each one of his awards . tim refuses to believe this and leaves joan 's room , accusing her of being a `` prostitute '' sent to destroy his life . whitlock recalled of their drug consumption during the tour : `` we did n't have little bits of anything . there were no grams around , let 's just put it like that . tom could n't believe it , the way we had these big bags laying out everywhere . i 'm almost ashamed to tell it , but it 's the truth . the group had been billed as `` eric clapton and friends '' , but a discussion ensued backstage just before their appearance , with harrison and pianist tony ashton among those involved , in an effort to find a proper band name . clapton recalls that ashton suggested `` del and the dominos '' , having taken to calling the guitarist `` derek '' or `` del '' since the delaney & bonnie tour the previous year . whitlock maintains that `` the dynamics '' was the name chosen and that ashton , following his opening set with ashton , gardner and dyke , mispronounced it when introducing the band . writing in 2013 , clapton and whitlock biographer marc roberty quoted jeff dexter , the compere at the lyceum show , who recalled that `` derek and the dominos '' had already been decided on before they went on stage .
obama administration officials , in their strongest language yet , warned wednesday of dangerous interruptions to terrorist tracking as top senate republicans raced to find a compromise that would prevent the shutdown of major u.s. intelligence programs on sunday . even if lawmakers reach an agreement , the program will lapse until legislation is approved by both the house and the senate next week -- something administration officials said could pose a grave threat to americans ' safety . a gap in the programs amounts to playing `` national security russian roulette , '' according to one official . unless reauthorized by congress , the national security agency will have to shutter , at least temporarily , its bulk phone data collection program , which provides the intelligence community clues as to who potential terrorists are calling . as of may 7 , 2015 , the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that the interpretation of section 215 of the patriot act was wrong and that the nsa program that has been collecting americans ' phone records in bulk is illegal . it stated that section 215 can not be clearly interpreted to allow government to collect national phone data and , as a result , expired on june 1 , 2015 . this ruling `` is the first time a higher-level court in the regular judicial system has reviewed the n.s.a. phone records program . '' the u.s. government on monday found itself with fewer tools to investigate terrorism -- at least temporarily -- after the senate let provisions of the patriot act expire sunday night . while officials warned of national security risks , it is clear that the lapse will not come close to debilitating counterterrorism efforts . the senate entered a debate period late sunday on the patriot act that pushed beyond the midnight deadline , effectively ending three provisions of that law , including the national security agency 's bulk data collection program . the lapse was a huge victory for privacy hawks who have called for changes to that program and others under the patriot act since edward snowden first blew the lid off the nsa 's domestic surveillance programs in 2013 .

the center of mass -lrb- barycenter -rrb- of the pluto -- charon system lies outside either body . because neither object truly orbits the other , and charon has 12.2 % the mass of pluto , it has been argued that charon should be considered to be part of a binary system with pluto . the international astronomical union -lrb- iau -rrb- states that charon is considered to be just a satellite of pluto , but the idea that charon might be classified a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date . pluto was discovered by clyde tombaugh in 1930 as the ninth planet from the sun . after 1992 , its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the kuiper belt . in 2005 , eris , a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27 % more massive than pluto , was discovered . this led the international astronomical union -lrb- iau -rrb- to define the term `` planet '' formally in 2006 , during their 26th general assembly . new horizons was originally planned as a voyage to the only unexplored planet in the solar system . when the spacecraft was launched , pluto was still classified as a planet , later to be reclassified as a dwarf planet by the international astronomical union -lrb- iau -rrb- . some members of the new horizons team , including alan stern , disagree with the iau definition and still describe pluto as the ninth planet . pluto 's satellites nix and hydra also have a connection with the spacecraft : the first letters of their names -lrb- n and h -rrb- are the initials of new horizons .
disney is buying a huge chunk of 21st century fox in a deal that promises to reshape the media industry and help the entertainment giant fend off digital rivals such as netflix . the $ 52.4 billion deal will combine two of the biggest players in hollywood . the sale represents a remarkable turn in the career of octogenarian mogul rupert murdoch , who is cashing out after building a major media empire . for its part , disney is adding even more prime entertainment assets to an already swollen portfolio as it battles upstart streaming services that have undercut the traditional cable subscription model . bob iger could wind up being the ceo of the 21st century after sealing a deal to scoop up a big chunk of the entertainment assets of 21st century fox for more than $ 50 billion . much like billionaire industrialist tony stark -- aka iron man in the disney-owned marvel franchise -- iger has now built a massive movie and tv empire that is rivaled by nobody else in hollywood . under iger 's watch , disney has scooped up `` toy story '' and `` finding nemo '' animated studio pixar , marvel entertainment and its stable of superheroes from `` the avengers , '' and star wars owner lucasfilm . the purchase of the fox film studio , along with some regional sports networks , cable channels fx and national geographic and fox 's stake in streaming video network hulu , is yet another move by iger to make disney a content company that literally has entertainment brands that can hook boys and girls from cradle to grave . disney has just bought itself a very messy deal in europe . the u.s. entertainment giant announced thursday that it will spend $ 52.4 billion to swallow most of 21st century fox , including its minority stake in british pay tv provider sky . here 's where things get interesting : long before it was for sale , fox struck a $ 15 billion deal to buy the 61 % of sky it did n't already own . the takeover -- inked a year ago -- has repeatedly been delayed due to a u.k. government review and its future is in doubt .

in don quixote , there are basically two different types of castilian : old castilian is spoken only by don quixote , while the rest of the roles speak a contemporary -lrb- late 16th century -rrb- version of spanish . the old castilian of don quixote is a humoristic resource -- he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that made him mad ; and many times , when he talks nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old . this humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language , but when the book was published it was much celebrated . -lrb- english translations can get some sense of the effect by having don quixote use king james bible or shakespearian english , or even middle english . -rrb- after a short period of feigning health , don quixote requests his neighbour , sancho panza , to be his squire , promising him a petty governorship -lrb- ínsula -rrb- . sancho is a poor and simple farmer but more practical than the head-in-the-clouds don quixote and agrees to the offer , sneaking away with don quixote in the early dawn . it is here that their famous adventures begin , starting with don quixote 's attack on windmills that he believes to be ferocious giants . after escaping the musketeers , don quixote and sancho ride to a nearby inn . once again , don quixote imagines the inn is a castle , although sancho is not quite convinced . don quixote is given a bed in a former hayloft , and sancho sleeps on the rug next to the bed ; they share the loft with a muleteer . when night comes , don quixote imagines the servant girl at the inn , helen , to be a beautiful princess , and makes her sit on his bed with him , scaring her .

mcdonald 's success in the 1960s was in large part due to the company 's skillful marketing and flexible response to customer demand . in 1962 , the filet-o-fish sandwich , billed as `` the fish that catches people '' , was introduced in mcdonald 's restaurants . the new item had originally met with disapproval from kroc , but after its successful test marketing , he eventually agreed to add it . another item that kroc had backed a year previously , a burger with a slice of pineapple and a slice of cheese , known as a `` hulaburger '' , had flopped -lrb- both it and the filet-o-fish were developed in catholic neighborhoods where burger sales dropped off markedly on fridays and during lent -rrb- . in 2001 , eric schlosser 's book fast food nation included criticism of the business practices of mcdonald 's . among the critiques were allegations that mcdonald 's -lrb- along with other companies within the fast food industry -rrb- uses its political influence to increase its profits at the expense of people 's health and the social conditions of its workers . the book also brought into question mcdonald 's advertisement techniques in which it targets children . while the book did mention other fast-food chains , it focused primarily on mcdonald 's . following the difficulties of the early and mid-1990s , several moves in 1998 seemed to indicate a reinvigorated mcdonald 's . in february the company for the first time took a stake in another fast-food chain when it purchased a minority interest in the 16-unit , colorado-based chipotle mexican grill chain . the following month came the announcement that mcdonald 's would improve the taste of several sandwiches and introduce several new menu items . mcflurry desserts , developed by a canadian franchisee in 1997 , proved popular when launched in the united states in the summer of 1998 .
since 2004 , haysbert has appeared as the official spokesman for the allstate insurance company . his commercials typically end with one of the two allstate corporation official slogans , either `` are you in good hands ? '' or `` that 's allstate 's stand . '' however , his commercials have combined the two with `` that 's allstate 's stand . in may 2011 , allstate announced that it was purchasing esurance and rate-comparison site answer financial for approximately $ 1 billion . at the time , esurance was selling policies in 30 states and was in the midst of a five-year growth period that saw them double the number of policies in force . allstate , for its part , was losing policy holders to the three major online policy retailers : esurance , progressive , and geico . allstate 's acquisition of esurance was completed in october of that year . in 1897 , the company that would become encompass began selling personal insurance under the motto `` protection and security .

in the 1820s , the french physiologist henri milne-edwards introduced the notion of physiological division of labor , which allowed to `` compare and study living things as if they were machines created by the industry of man . '' inspired in the work of adam smith , milne-edwards wrote that the `` body of all living beings , whether animal or plant , resembles a factory ... where the organs , comparable to workers , work incessantly to produce the phenomena that constitute the life of the individual . '' in more differentiated organisms , the functional labor could be apportioned between different instruments or systems -lrb- called by him as appareils -rrb- . in 1994 , klaus schmidt of the german archaeological institute , who had previously been working at nevalı çori , was looking for another site to excavate . he reviewed the archaeological literature on the surrounding area , found the 1963 chicago researchers ' brief description of göbekli tepe , and decided to reexamine the site . having found similar structures at nevalı çori , he recognized the possibility that the rocks and slabs were prehistoric . the following year , he began excavating there in collaboration with the şanlıurfa museum , and soon unearthed the first of the huge t-shaped pillars . göbekli tepe is regarded by some as an archaeological discovery of great importance since it could profoundly change the understanding of a crucial stage in the development of human society . ian hodder of stanford university said , `` göbekli tepe changes everything '' . if indeed the site was built by hunter-gatherers as some researchers believe then it would mean that the ability to erect monumental complexes was within the capacities of these sorts of groups , which would overturn previous assumptions . some researchers believe that the construction of göbekli tepe may have contributed to the later development of urban civilization , or , as excavator klaus schmidt put it , `` first came the temple , then the city .

moscow -lrb- , in us mainly : ; russian : москва , tr . moskva , ipa : -lrb- listen -rrb- -rrb- is the capital and most populous city of russia , with approximately 12.6 million residents within the city limits , 17 million within the urban area and 20 million within the metropolitan area . moscow is one of russia 's federal cities . moscow is the political , economic , cultural , and scientific centre of russia and eastern europe . the space race was a 20th-century competition between two cold war rivals , the soviet union -lrb- ussr -rrb- and the united states -lrb- us -rrb- , to achieve firsts in spaceflight capability . it had its origins in the ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following world war ii . the technological advantage required to rapidly achieve spaceflight milestones was seen as necessary for national security , and mixed with the symbolism and ideology of the time . the space race led to pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites , uncrewed space probes of the moon , venus , and mars , and human spaceflight in low earth orbit and to the moon.the competition began in earnest on august 2 , 1955 when the soviet union responded to the us announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the international geophysical year , by declaring they would also launch a satellite `` in the near future '' . the united states of america -lrb- usa -rrb- , commonly known as the united states -lrb- u.s. or us -rrb- or america , is a country comprising 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . at 3.8 million square miles -lrb- 9.8 million km2 -rrb- , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of europe . most of the country is located in central north america between canada and mexico . with an estimated population of over 328 million , the u.s. is the third most populous country .
in 1884 , the u.s. congress first established a bureau of labor statistics with the bureau of labor act , to collect information about labor and employment . this bureau was under the department of the interior . the bureau started collecting economic data in 1884 , and published their first report in 1886 . later , in 1888 , the bureau of labor became an independent department of labor , but lacked executive rank . the united states department of labor -lrb- dol -rrb- is a cabinet-level department of the u.s. federal government responsible for occupational safety , wage and hour standards , unemployment insurance benefits , reemployment services , and some economic statistics ; many u.s. states also have such departments . the department is headed by the u.s. secretary of labor . the purpose of the department of labor is to foster , promote , and develop the wellbeing of the wage earners , job seekers , and retirees of the united states ; improve working conditions ; advance opportunities for profitable employment ; and assure work-related benefits and rights . in carrying out this mission , the department of labor administers and enforces more than 180 federal laws and thousands of federal regulations . the purpose of the department of labor is to foster , promote , and develop the wellbeing of the wage earners , job seekers , and retirees of the united states ; improve working conditions ; advance opportunities for profitable employment ; and assure work-related benefits and rights . in carrying out this mission , the department of labor administers and enforces more than 180 federal laws and thousands of federal regulations . these mandates and the regulations that implement them cover many workplace activities for about 10 million employers and 125 million workers .
the new york state legislature granted the metropolitan museum of art an act of incorporation on april 13 , 1870 , `` for the purpose of establishing and maintaining in said city a museum and library of art , of encouraging and developing the study of the fine arts , and the application of art to manufacture and natural life , of advancing the general knowledge of kindred subjects , and to that end of furnishing popular instruction and recreations . '' this legislation was supplemented later by the 1893 act , chapter 476 , which required that its collections `` shall be kept open and accessible to the public free of all charge throughout the year . '' the founders included businessmen and financiers , as well as leading artists and thinkers of the day , who wanted to open a museum to bring art and art education to the american people . karl marx said that the culture of a society is dominated by the mores of the ruling-class , wherein their superimposed value system is abided by each social class -lrb- the upper , the middle , the lower -rrb- regardless of the socio-economic results it yields to them . in that sense , contemporary societies are bourgeois to the degree that they practice the mores of the small-business `` shop culture '' of early modern france ; which the writer émile zola -lrb- 1840 -- 1902 -rrb- naturalistically presented , analysed , and ridiculed in the twenty-two-novel series -lrb- 1871 -- 1893 -rrb- about les rougon-macquart family ; the thematic thrust is the necessity for social progress , by subordinating the economic sphere to the social sphere of life . the expansion of eleftherias square towards the sea completed the new commercial hub of the city and at the time was considered one of the most vibrant squares of the city . as the city grew , workers moved to the western districts , because of their proximity to factories and industrial activities ; while the middle and upper classes gradually moved from the city-center to the eastern suburbs , leaving mainly businesses . in 1917 , a devastating fire swept through the city and burned uncontrollably for 32 hours . it destroyed the city 's historic center and a large part of its architectural heritage , but paved the way for modern development and allowed thessaloniki the development of a proper european city center , featuring wider diagonal avenues and monumental squares ; which the city initially lacked -- much of what was considered to be ` essential ' in european architecture .
finally , the court remanded the case to the epa , requiring the agency to review its contention that it has discretion in regulating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions . the court found the current rationale for not regulating to be inadequate and required the agency to articulate a reasonable basis in order to avoid regulation . the petitioners argued that the definition in the caa is so broad that carbon dioxide must be counted as an air pollutant . they claimed that the question was controlled by the words of the statute , so that factual debate was immaterial . furthermore , the petitioners filed substantial scientific evidence that the toxicity of carbon dioxide results from high concentrations and that causation of global warming transforms the gas into a pollutant . the administrator of the environmental protection agency is the head of the united states federal government 's environmental protection agency , and is thus responsible for enforcing the nation 's clean air and clean water acts , as well as numerous other environmental statutes . the administrator is nominated by the president of the united states and must be confirmed by a vote of the senate . the office of administrator of the environmental protection agency was created in 1970 in legislation that created the agency .
office depot announced a deal to merge with smaller rival officemax in an all-stock deal worth about $ 1.2 billion . details on the deal were limited . the companies said they expect to save $ 400 million to $ 600 million annually from the combination . but there were no estimates of staffing cuts or store closings . shares of rival office supply chains office depot and officemax soared in early trading tuesday following widespread reports that the two companies are in merger talks . officemax shares rallied 30 % , while shares of office depot , the larger of the two , surged 24 % . office depot has 1,262 stores worldwide , 39,000 employees , and 2011 sales of $ 11.5 billion , the last full year for which it has reported results . office max has 978 stores , 29,000 employees and 2011 sales of $ 7.1 billion . during its tenth anniversary in 1996 , staples became a member of the fortune 500 companies as sales surpassed $ 3 billion . on september 4 , 1996 , staples and office depot announced plans to merge . the federal trade commission decided that the merged company would unfairly increase office supply prices despite competition from officemax , because officemax did not have stores in many of the local markets that the merger would affect . staples argued that chains such as walmart and circuit city represented significant competition , but this argument did little to sway the ftc .

on july 25 , 2000 , bush surprised some observers when he selected dick cheney -- a former white house chief of staff , u.s. representative , and secretary of defense -- to be his running mate . at the time , cheney was serving as head of bush 's vice presidential search committee . soon after at the 2000 republican national convention , bush and cheney were officially nominated by the republican party . there were two wounds to his right side , and two to the top of his head , which would probably have resulted in unconsciousness . the left side of his lip was wounded , his jaw was fractured , and his teeth , neck and larynx were damaged . the pathologist said he `` would not have been able to engage in purposeful talk '' , according to the court of appeal . there were gunshot wounds to his left shoulder and left elbow . on march 30 , 1981 , while bush was in texas , reagan was shot and seriously wounded by john hinckley jr. . bush immediately flew back from washington d.c. ; when his plane landed , his aides advised him to proceed directly to the white house by helicopter in order to show that the government was still functioning . bush rejected the idea , as he feared that such a dramatic scene risked giving the impression that he sought to usurp reagan 's powers and prerogatives . during reagan 's short period of incapacity , bush presided over cabinet meetings , met with congressional leaders and foreign leaders , and briefed reporters , but he consistently rejected the possibility of invoking the twenty-fifth amendment . bush 's handling of the attempted assassination and its aftermath made a positive impression on reagan , who recovered and returned to work within two weeks of the shooting .

rio de janeiro -lrb- ; portuguese : -lrb- listen -rrb- ; river of january -rrb- , or simply rio , is anchor to the rio de janeiro metropolitan area and the second-most populous municipality in brazil and the sixth-most populous in the americas . rio de janeiro is the capital of the state of rio de janeiro , brazil 's third-most populous state . part of the city has been designated as a world heritage site , named `` rio de janeiro : carioca landscapes between the mountain and the sea '' , by unesco on 1 july 2012 as a cultural landscape.founded in 1565 by the portuguese , the city was initially the seat of the captaincy of rio de janeiro , a domain of the portuguese empire . later , in 1763 , it became the capital of the state of brazil , a state of the portuguese empire . rio de janeiro is on the far western part of a strip of brazil 's atlantic coast -lrb- between a strait east to ilha grande , on the costa verde , and the cabo frio -rrb- , close to the tropic of capricorn , where the shoreline is oriented east -- west . facing largely south , the city was founded on an inlet of this stretch of the coast , guanabara bay -lrb- baía de guanabara -rrb- , and its entrance is marked by a point of land called sugar loaf -lrb- pão de açúcar -rrb- -- a `` calling card '' of the city . the fireworks display in rio de janeiro to celebrate new year 's eve is one of the largest in the world , lasting 15 to 20 minutes . it is estimated that 2 million people go to copacabana beach to see the spectacle . the festival also includes a concert that extends throughout the night . the celebration has become one of the biggest tourist attractions of rio de janeiro , attracting visitors from all over brazil as well as from different parts of the world , and the city hotels generally stay fully booked .
interstate 5 -lrb- i-5 -rrb- is the main north -- south interstate highway on the west coast of the united states , running largely parallel to the pacific coast of the contiguous u.s. from mexico to canada . it travels through the states of california , oregon , and washington , serving several large cities on the u.s. west coast , including san diego , los angeles , sacramento , portland , and seattle . it is currently the only continuous interstate highway to touch both the mexican border and the canadian border . upon crossing the mexican border at its southern terminus , interstate 5 continues to tijuana , baja california as mexico federal highway 1 .
in december 2018 , with the possibility of a government shutdown that month looming , the house passed a bill funding the government through february and providing 5.7 billion for the border wall between the united states and mexico favored by president trump hours after he told house republican leaders that he would not sign a package passed in the senate due to it not providing money for the barrier . on december 21 , after attending a meeting in the office of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , corker announced that senate leaders had reached an agreement on how to apply the house-passed bill and expressed hope it would ultimately lead to a deal averting a shutdown while cautioning the agreement was only on the bill 's processing . in a december 23 appearance on state of the union , corker called the conflict between democrats and republicans over funding a `` purposely contrived fight '' that would end with american borders remaining unsecured no matter which side won and furthered that it was `` a made-up fight so the president can look like he 's fighting but even if he wins , our borders are going to be insecure . '' corker noted that more funding was passed for border security in a 2013 amendment that received bipartisan support and opined that trump would have accepted a deal offered by senate minority leader chuck schumer the previous january granting 25 billion for border security in exchange for the reauthorization of the deferred action for childhood arrivals -lrb- daca -rrb- program if he was more concerned about border security than politics . upon entering office in 1981 , the incoming ronald reagan administration intended to push congress to abolish the nea completely over a three-year period . reagan 's first director of the office of management and budget , david a. stockman , thought the nea and the national endowment for the humanities were `` good to simply bring to a halt because they went too far , and they would be easy to defeat . '' another proposal would have halved the arts endowment budget . however , these plans were abandoned when the president 's special task force on the arts and humanities , which included close reagan allies such as conservatives charlton heston and joseph coors , discovered `` the needs involved and benefits of past assistance , '' concluding that continued federal support was important . from december 22 , 2018 until january 25 , 2019 , the federal government was shut down when congress refused to give in to trump 's demand for $ 5.7 billion in federal funds for a u.s. -- mexico border wall . in december 2018 , the republican-controlled senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding , and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the republican-controlled house of representatives and trump . after trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to `` build the wall '' , he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction . during this shutdown , mcconnell blocked the senate from voting on appropriations legislation , and said it was not his place to mediate between the senate and trump .
they got together again the following may in new york , while he and john lennon were there to inaugurate apple records . a few months after he returned to london , he invited her to spend some time with him there . when she arrived , they went to his home , where they spent the evening . `` he must have been really happy that night , '' said one of the fans who often loitered outside his home . linda darlene drouin was born in biddeford , maine , and raised in the new england town of milford , new hampshire . her father , rosaire drouin , was a construction worker of french-canadian ancestry . her mother , joyce taylor , was a homemaker . they struggled financially in a working-class home . linda 's daughter , heather , created another strong bond between them , since he had always liked and wanted children of his own . when he first met heather , who was nearly six , he insisted that she and linda move to london to live with him . after they did , he devoted time to heather , playing with her , reading her stories , and drawing cartoons with her . he sang her to sleep at bedtime .
in october 2017 , the interior department 's office of inspector general -lrb- oig -rrb- launched an investigation into zinke 's use of three charter flights during his tenure as interior secretary . in april 2018 , oig released its report , concluding that zinke 's chartered flight to give a speech to the june 2017 speech to the las vegas golden knights nhl team was authorized `` without complete information '' and that the speech was not official business because zinke did not discuss the interior department or his role as interior secretary . oig concluded that the two other charter flights , one to alaska and the other to the u.s. virgin islands , `` appeared to have been reasonable as related to official doi business . '' in december 2017 , politico reported that zinke had booked government helicopters for more than $ 14,000 to travel in june and july 2017 . one of these trips was the swearing-in ceremony of his successor in congress ; the department of interior defended the use of government helicopters instead of a two-hour car drive by saying zinke would otherwise not be able to fully participate in the swearing-in ceremony . an interior spokesperson also said to a politico reporter inquiring about the expenses , `` shame on you for not respecting the office of a member of congress . '' another of these trips was the use of a park police helicopter to have a horseback ride with vice president mike pence ; the interior department justified the use of the helicopter over the three-hour car drive by saying `` the secretary will be able to familiarize himself with the in-flight capabilities of an aircraft he is in charge of '' and that park police staff would `` provide an added measure of security to the secretary during his travel . '' because the policies and activities of the department of the interior and many of its agencies have a substantial impact in the western united states , the secretary of the interior has typically come from a western state ; only three of the individuals to hold the office since 1949 have not been from a state lying west of the mississippi river . the current interior secretary is david bernhardt , who held the office in an acting capacity until april 2019 . he succeeded ryan zinke who resigned on january 2 , 2019 .
republicans were quick to condemn comments from their party 's nominee , when donald trump refused to say he 'd accept the outcome of the presidential election . during the debate , fox news ' chris wallace , who was moderating , asked trump , `` do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir , that you will absolutely accept the result of this election ? '' trump responded , `` i will look at it at the time . i 'm not looking at anything now . donald trump 's campaign manager on thursday dismissed suggestions the republican nominee is undercutting american democracy by refusing to say whether he will accept the results of the election if he loses . in an at-times contentious interview with cnn 's chris cuomo on `` new day , '' kellyanne conway tried to clarify trump 's comments that he would take a wait-and-see approach before accepting the outcome . `` what donald trump has said , over time , if you take all of his statements together , he has said that he will respect the results of the election , '' said conway , a veteran republican pollster who was named trump 's campaign manager in august . at wednesday night 's presidential debate , trump -- who has repeatedly said the election is rigged against him and claimed there is `` large scale '' vote fraud -- refused to say whether he will accept the results on november 8 . chris wallace delivered a sterling performance as moderator of the final presidential debate on wednesday night , maintaining order and focusing on substantive issues that matter to american voters . in an otherwise nasty and vitriolic campaign season , the `` fox news sunday '' host pressed hillary clinton and donald trump on matters pertaining to the u.s. economy , america 's foreign policy and the supreme court , while also addressing pressing questions about both candidates ' fitness to lead . wallace was widely praised for his performance by fellow journalists , political operatives on both sides of the aisle and even a few celebrities . `` chris wallace did a good job .
born in devon , england , johnstone grew up hating school , finding that it blunted his imagination and made him feel self-conscious and shy . after teaching at a working-class school in battersea , london in the early 1950s , johnstone was commissioned to write a play by the royal court theatre in 1956 . he subsequently became a play-reader , director and drama teacher there , where he chose to reverse all that his teachers had told him in an attempt to create more spontaneous actors . in the 1970s , johnstone moved to calgary , alberta to teach at the university of calgary . in april 2012 , she wrote about the first round of the french presidential elections a few days earlier and identified front national leader marine le pen as `` notably '' `` basically on the left '' while also labelling le pen as `` demagogic '' . describing johnstone as `` an excellent journalist '' , alexander cockburn in the nation , quoted from an email she sent to him : `` there is absolutely nothing attesting to anti-semitism on the part of marine le pen . she has actually tried to woo the powerful jewish organisations , and her anti-islam stance is also a way to woo such groups '' . the book was rejected by publishers in sweden , prompting an open letter in 2003 defending johnstone 's book -- and her right to publish -- that was signed by , among others , noam chomsky , arundhati roy , tariq ali and john pilger . the signatories stated : `` we regard diana johnstone 's fools ' crusade as an outstanding work , dissenting from the mainstream view but doing so by an appeal to fact and reason , in a great tradition . '' ed vulliamy , who reported for the guardian during the bosnian war , called johnstone 's book `` poison '' finding unbelievable the response of chomsky and the others . in march 2006 , david aaronovitch in the times wrote : `` in the sense that the world understood there to have been an act amounting to genocide at srebrenica ... johnstone certainly , and chomsky implicitly , had most certainly denied the massacre '' .
in 1941 , the `` army of the united states '' was founded to fight world war ii . the regular army , army of the united states , the national guard and officer/enlisted reserve corps -lrb- orc and erc -rrb- existed simultaneously . after world war ii , the orc and erc were combined into the united states army reserve . the army of the united states was re-established for the korean war and vietnam war and was demobilized upon the suspension of the draft . in the pacific war , u.s. army soldiers participated alongside the united states marine corps in capturing the pacific islands from japanese control . following the axis surrenders in may -lrb- germany -rrb- and august -lrb- japan -rrb- of 1945 , army troops were deployed to japan and germany to occupy the two defeated nations . two years after world war ii , the army air forces separated from the army to become the united states air force in september 1947 . in 1948 , the army was desegregated by order of president harry s. truman . the united states joined world war i as an `` associated power '' in 1917 on the side of britain , france , russia , italy and the other allies . u.s. troops were sent to the western front and were involved in the last offensives that ended the war . with the armistice in november 1918 , the army once again decreased its forces .
this act was part of a bigger movement in the early 20th century to use special groups like commissions to regulate and oversee certain forms of business . the federal trade commission act works in junction with the sherman act and the clayton act . any violations of the sherman act will also violate the federal trade commission act so the federal trade commission can act on cases that violate each act . the federal trade commission act , along with two other antitrust laws , were created for the sole objective to `` protect the process of competition for the benefit of consumers , making sure there are strong incentives for businesses to operate efficiently , keep prices down , and keep quality up . '' in 1982 the reagan administration used the sherman act to break up at&t into one long-distance company and seven regional `` baby bells '' , arguing that competition should replace monopoly for the benefit of consumers and the economy as a whole . the pace of business takeovers quickened in the 1990s , but whenever one large corporation sought to acquire another , it first had to obtain the approval of either the ftc , fcc or the justice department . often the government demanded that certain subsidiaries be sold so that the new company would not monopolize a particular geographical market . the inspiration and motivation for this act started in 1890 , when the sherman act was passed . this era in time was an antitrust movement to prevent manufacturers from joining price-fixing cartels . after the case northern securities co. v. united states , which dismantled a j. p. morgan company , antitrust enforcement became institutionalized . soon after , roosevelt created the bureau of corporations , an agency that reported on the economy and businesses in the industry .
during a siege of the ammonite capital of rabbah , david remains in jerusalem . he spies a woman , bathsheba , bathing and summons her ; she becomes pregnant . the text in the bible does not explicitly state whether bathsheba consented to sex . david calls her husband , uriah the hittite , back from the battle to rest , hoping that he will go home to his wife and the child will be presumed to be his . david is an important figure in rabbinic judaism , with many legends around him . according to one tradition , david was raised as the son of his father jesse and spent his early years herding his father 's sheep in the wilderness while his brothers were in school . saul sets david over his army . all israel loves david , but his popularity causes saul to fear him -lrb- `` what else can he wish but the kingdom ?

the gospels say that jesus was betrayed to the authorities by a disciple , and many scholars consider this report to be highly reliable . he was executed on the orders of pontius pilate , the roman prefect of judaea . pilate most likely saw jesus ' reference to the kingdom of god as a threat to roman authority and worked with the temple elites to have jesus executed . the sadducean high-priestly leaders of the temple more plausibly had jesus executed for political reasons than for his teaching . now there was about this time jesus , a wise man , ... he drew over to him both many of the jews and many of the gentiles ... and when pilate , at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us , had condemned him to the cross ... around ad 30 , jesus and his followers traveled from galilee to jerusalem to observe passover . jesus caused a disturbance in the second temple , which was the center of jewish religious and civil authority . sanders associates it with jesus ' prophecy that the temple would be totally demolished . jesus held a last meal with his disciples , which is the origin of the christian sacrament of bread and wine .

the museum of costume art was founded by aline bernstein and irene lewisohn . in 1946 , with the financial support of the fashion industry , the museum of costume art merged with the metropolitan museum of art as the costume institute , and in 1959 became a curatorial department . today , its collection contains more than 35,000 costumes and accessories . the costume institute used to have a permanent gallery space in what was known as the `` basement '' area of the met because it was downstairs at the bottom of the met facility . the craft contemporary , formerly known as craft and folk art museum -lrb- cafam -rrb- , los angeles , usa , was incorporated in 1973 and began formal museum operations in 1975 . it is the successor to the commercial gallery , the egg and the eye , which opened november 1 , 1965 in the same historic building . like the present-day museum , the gallery showed contemporary craft objects and folk art . a popular restaurant on the mezzanine featured a long list of ethnically inspired omelettes . in 1966 , after receiving a permanent charter , the museum expanded its name and mission . as the museum of american folk arts , it looked beyond the traditional definitions of american folk art . its exhibitions and collection began to reflect `` every aspect of the folk arts in america -- north , south , east , and west . '' founding curator herbert w. hemphill jr. `` expanded the notion of folk art beyond traditional , utilitarian , and communal expressions . '' under his direction , the museum began to champion idiosyncratic and individualistic artwork from the fields of traditional and contemporary folk art . in doing so , the museum ushered in a new era in the field of twentieth-century folk art .

greenwich hospital was a permanent home for retired sailors of the royal navy , which operated from 1692 to 1869 . its buildings were later used by the royal naval college , greenwich and the university of greenwich , and are now known as the old royal naval college . the word `` hospital '' was used in its original sense of a place providing hospitality for those in need of it , and did not refer to medical care , although the buildings included an infirmary which , after greenwich hospital closed , operated as dreadnought seaman 's hospital until 1986 . in february 2017 , the south london critical care network reviewed the hospital 's intensive care department and found a complete lack of medical leadership . care for patients across the trust could be affected because of issues with the critical care service . it was suggested that `` younger fitter patients with single organ failure '' would not be admitted to intensive care until they developed multiorgan failure because of pressures on bed availability . only 3.5 full-time equivalent consultants were in post with staff working locum shifts to fill gaps . the charitable foundation of greenwich hospital still exists , although it is no longer based at the original site . it is now a royal charity for the benefit of seafarers and their dependants , with the secretary of state for defence acting as the crown 's sole trustee . the charity now funds sheltered housing for former royal navy personnel and the school it spawned , the royal hospital school , now at holbrook in suffolk . the charity 's head office is located in the city of london .
in a cnbc interview at the end of july 2008 , alan greenspan said he believed the u.s. was not yet in a recession , but that it could enter one due to a global economic slowdown . alan greenspan was the chairman of the federal reserve of the united states from 1987 to 2006 . he was appointed by president ronald reagan in august 1987 and was reappointed by president bill clinton in 1996 . he was , perhaps , the person most singly responsible for the housing bubble in the u.s. , although he said that `` i really did n't get it until very late in 2005 and 2006 . '' greenspan stated that the housing bubble was `` fundamentally engendered by the decline in real long-term interest rates '' , though he also claims that long-term interest rates are beyond the control of central banks because `` the market value of global long-term securities is approaching $ 100 trillion '' and thus these and other asset markets are large enough that they `` now swamp the resources of central banks '' . in september 2008 joseph stiglitz stated that greenspan `` did n't really believe in regulation ; when the excesses of the financial system were noted , -lrb- he and others -rrb- called for self-regulation -- an oxymoron '' . greenspan , according to the new york times , says he himself is blameless . on april 6 , 2005 , greenspan called for a substantial increase in the regulation of fannie mae and freddie mac : `` appearing before the senate banking committee , the fed chairman , alan greenspan , said the enormous portfolios of the companies -- nearly a quarter of the home-mortgage market -- posed significant risks to the nation 's financial system should either company face significant problems . '' despite this , greenspan still claims to be a firm believer in free markets , although in his 2007 biography he wrote , `` history has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums '' as seen before the credit crisis of 2008 .
tarantino discovered the centerpiece for the work in 2009 while filming a movie with an actor that had the same stunt double for 20 years . even though there was nothing but a small bit for the stuntman to do , tarantino was asked to use him , and he agreed . the relationship fascinated tarantino and inspired him to make a film about hollywood . tarantino said that while the stuntman may have been a perfect double for the actor years earlier , at the time he had come to meet them , `` this was maybe the last or second-to-last thing they 'd be doing together '' . laine next found employment in a munitions plant , at a salary of $ 150.00 a week . he quit singing for what was perhaps the fifth or sixth time of his already long career . while working at the plant , he met a trio of girl singers , and became engaged to the lead singer . the group had been noticed by johnny mercer 's capitol records , and convinced laine to head out to hollywood with them as their agent . on june 12 , 1996 , he was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the 27th annual songwriters ' hall of fame awards ceremony at the new york sheraton . on his 80th birthday , the united states congress declared him to be a national treasure . then , a decade later on march 30 , 2003 , frankie celebrated his 90th birthday , and several of his old pals , herb jeffries , patti page and kay starr were welcomed to his birthday bash in san diego , as each of them gave him a helping hand in blowing out the candles .

bartle called to his office 20 business leaders and called upon them to form an association later known as `` the gold coats '' , whose sole objective was to sell and take down payments on the 35,000 season tickets required . `` the gold coats '' had to sell season tickets to people without knowing the team name , where it was coming from , who the owner was , which football league they would play in , who the players or coaches were , when the team would play its first game in kansas city , or where it would play . hunt gave bartle a four-month deadline to accomplish the sales . bartle and `` the gold coats '' made good in only 8 weeks . hunt , with a roster replete with players who had played college football in texas , wanted to maintain a lineage to the team 's roots and wanted to name the club the kansas city texans . `` the lakers stayed the lakers when they moved from minnesota to california '' , he reasoned . `` but jack steadman convinced me that was n't too smart . it would n't sell . '' in 1953 , first national 's consumer finance operation launched its `` first charge '' card which remains to this day the most profitable innovation in first national 's long history . the bank issued a simple little card , which was nothing more than a white piece of plasticized paper , complete with a green logo , and an inscription which spelled `` first charge account service '' and a red number which served to identify the cardholder . first bankcard is one of the top three banks serving the credit card needs of other financial institutions , including union bank of california and people 's bank . first bankcard also services credit cards for major league lacrosse , world of warcraft , scheels all sports , just to name a few .
although the phase-out of cfcs took almost two decades , the policy is generally seen as a success . while a crisis seems to be averted , due to the longevity of cfc particles in the atmosphere , the ozone layer is only expected to start showing sign of recovery by 2024 . ozone depletion is the reduced concentration of ozone in the earth 's stratosphere -lrb- called the ozone layer -rrb- , where it serves to block much of the ultraviolet radiation from the sun . chlorofluorocarbons -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which were used beginning in the 1930s in a number of important areas , were determined in 1974 to be responsible for much of the depletion of the ozone layer . four years later , the epa and fda banned cfcs in aerosol cans . as research in the 1980s indicated that the problem was worse than before , and revealed a controversial massive hole in the ozone layer over antarctica , three international agreements were made to reduce the ozone-damaging substances - the vienna convention , the 1987 montreal protocol , and a third agreement in 1990 in london . historically , the politics of climate change dates back to several conferences in the late 1960s and the early 1970s under nato and president richard nixon . 1979 saw the world 's first world climate conference . 1985 was the year that the vienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer was created and two years later in 1987 saw the signing of the montreal protocol under the vienna convention . this model of using a framework conference followed by protocols under the framework was seen as a promising governing structure that could be used as a path towards a functional governance approach that could be used to tackle broad global multi-nation/state challenges like global warming .
in march 1980 , nero wolfe was one of half-a-dozen new series being considered by the team of brandon tartikoff and fred silverman at nbc , according to peter boyer of the associated press . `` the idea has been tried unsuccessfully on tv before , most recently by abc , '' boyer reported . `` but nbc has an angle going that will certainly make this nero wolfe worthy of notice -- the distinct possibility that orson welles will play the lead role . '' the pilot episode was to be written by leon tokatyan -lrb- lou grant -rrb- . `` american nero wolfe fans had their dreams come true in 1981 , when the nbc network allowed viewers on a weekly , prime time visit to the infamous new york brownstone on west 35th street , '' wrote brian sheridan in the spring 2008 issue of the gazette : the journal of the wolfe pack . sheridan interviewed lee horsley , who found his first major role when he was cast as archie goodwin . horsley recalled an enjoyable relationship with william conrad , whose off-screen demeanor was a perfect fit for the character . `` he was definitely nero wolfe down to the toes , '' horsley said . in april 1996 , when the tv land network made its debut , nero wolfe was featured in its `` saturday cavalcade '' lineup of great detectives . in 1999 the series was part of an afternoon block of tv land 's counterprogramming to network soap operas , and it also aired in the wee hours of the morning .
in 1929 money ran out , and mees decided to help them once more . mees knew that the solution to the problem of the wandering dyes had already been found by one of kodak 's own scientists , leslie brooker . so he gave mannes and godowsky enough money to pay off the loan kuhn loeb had supplied and offered them a yearly salary . he also gave them a three-year deadline to come up with a finished and commercially viable product . mannes and godowsky followed that route , started experimenting with color couplers , but their experiments were hindered by a lack of money , supplies and facilities . in 1922 robert wood , a friend of mannes , wrote a letter to kodak 's chief scientist mees , introducing mannes and godowsky and their experiments , and asking if mees could let them use the kodak facilities for a few days . mees offered to help , and after meeting with mannes and godowsky agreed to supply them with multi-layer emulsions made to mannes and godowsky 's specifications . financial aid , in the form of a $ 20,000 loan , was supplied by the investment firm kuhn , loeb and company , who had mannes and godowsky 's experiments brought to their attention by a secretary working for that firm mannes had acquainted . not long before the three-year period would expire , at the end of 1933 , mannes and godowsky still had not managed to come up with anything usable , and thought their experiments would be terminated by kodak . their only chance for survival was to invent something in a hurry , something that the company could put into production and capitalise . mees , however , granted them a one-year extension , and still not having solved all the technical challenges they had to solve , they eventually presented mees with a two-color movie process in 1934 . the original kodachrome invented by john capstaff some 20 years earlier was also two-color .
alexander hamilton took the oath of office as the first secretary of the treasury on september 11 , 1789 . hamilton had served as george washington 's aide-de-camp during the revolution and was of great importance in the ratification of the constitution . because of his financial and managerial acumen , hamilton was a logical choice for solving the problem of the new nation 's heavy war debt . hamilton 's first official act was to submit a report to congress in which he laid the foundation for the nation 's financial health . in february 2007 , the u.s. mint , under the presidential $ 1 coin act of 2005 , introduced a new $ 1 u.s. presidential dollar coin . based on the success of the `` 50 state quarters '' series , the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations , starting with george washington , on the obverse side . the reverse side features the statue of liberty . to allow for larger , more detailed portraits , the traditional inscriptions of `` e pluribus unum '' , `` in god we trust '' , the year of minting or issuance , and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face . dollar coins have never been popular in the united states since the removal of precious metal from coins . despite efforts by the government to promote their use to save the cost of printing one-dollar bills , such as the presidential $ 1 coin program , most americans currently use the bill . for this reason , since december 11 , 2011 , the mint has not produced dollar coins for general circulation , and all dollar coins produced after that date have been specifically for collectors . these collector coins can be ordered directly from the mint , while pre-2012 circulation dollar can be obtained from most u.s. banks .
sandra bullock has proved her congeniality extends to animals , too . the actress made a $ 100,000 donation to the humane society of ventura county , which is on the ground helping the non-human victims of the wildfires in southern california . `` our efforts for rescuing and caring for evacuated animals from the hill and woolsey fires had caught her attention and her team reached out to the shelter to show their support , '' the organization wrote on facebook . `` sandra bullock and her family have reached out to other nonprofit organizations both during this incident and in the past . the humane watch website was created by the center for consumer freedom . in 2012 , mother jones reported the following : `` according to the center for consumer freedom 's 2010 tax filing , the group set aside about a million dollars to set up its anti-humane society website `` humane watch .

from the operator 's perspective , what i need is something that will not give me just a spot in time but will give me a track of what is happening . when we are trying to find out if the serbs are taking arms , moving tanks or artillery into bosnia , we can get a picture of them stacked up on the serbian side of the bridge . we do not know whether they then went on to move across that bridge . we need the that a tactical , an sr-71 , a u-2 , or an unmanned vehicle of some sort , will give us , in addition to , not in replacement of , the ability of the satellites to go around and check not only that spot but a lot of other spots around the world for us . the army this week selected the company to build its much-anticipated new vehicle to replace the humvee -- a multibillion dollar contract . oshkosh corporation , located in oshkosh , wisconsin , won the $ 6.7 billion contract to produce the joint light tactical vehicle , which will also be used by the marine corps . the initial order will be for 17,000 vehicles , with production set to begin next year . the army expects to have its first jltv unit ready to go in fiscal year 2018 , according to a release from the army . on 13 november 2013 , air force chief of staff general mark welsh revealed that the service was interested in the sr-72 's hypersonic capabilities , but had not spoken with lockheed martin about the aircraft . its high speed appeals to the service to reduce the time an adversary would have to react to an operation . they are pursuing hypersonic technology , but do n't yet have the material ability to construct a full-size plane like the unmanned sr-72 . the sr-72 was unveiled in the midst of sequestration budget cuts that have forced the air force to prioritize acquisition projects and sacrifice mission readiness .
wałęsa is well known for his conservative stance on lgbt rights . in 2013 he said on polish television that `` he does n't wish for this minority , which he tolerates and understands , to impose itself on the majority . referring to robert biedroń , he argued that , considering that as they represent less than one percent of the polish society , proportionally speaking , homosexual mps should sit `` in the last row of the parliament , or even behind its walls '' . after sharp international criticism , including city authorities of san francisco 's decision to rename walesa street as a result of those remarks , wałęsa apologized for his comments , stressing that `` being a man of old date , in his view one 's sexual orientation should lie in one 's intimate sphere '' . the pirke de-rabbi eliezer told that the first trial was when abram was born , and all the magnates of the kingdom and the magicians sought to kill him . abram 's family hid abram in a cave for 13 years , during which he never saw the sun or moon . after 13 years , abram came out speaking the holy language , hebrew , and he despised idols and held in abomination the graven images , and he trusted in god , saying -lrb- in the words of psalm 84:12 -rrb- : `` blessed is the man who trusts in you .

as part of its mandate to gather intelligence , the cia is looking increasingly online for information , and has become a major consumer of social media . `` we 're looking at youtube , which carries some unique and honest-to-goodness intelligence , '' said doug naquin , director of the dni open source center -lrb- osc -rrb- at cia headquarters . `` we 're looking at chat rooms and things that did n't exist five years ago , and trying to stay ahead .

the terminology of the british isles refers to the various words and phrases that are used to describe the different -lrb- and sometimes overlapping -rrb- geographical and political areas of the islands of great britain , ireland , and the smaller islands which surround them . the terminology is often a source of confusion , partly owing to the similarity between some of the actual words used , but also because they are often used loosely . in addition , many of the words carry both geographical and political connotations which are affected by the history of the islands . the purpose of this article is to explain the meanings of and relationships among the terms in use ; however many of these classifications are contentious and are the subject of disagreement -lrb- see the british isles naming dispute -rrb- . the trump administration 's national counterterrorism strategy correctly states that the country has `` long faced a persistent security threat from domestic terrorists who are not motivated by a radical islamist ideology but are instead motivated by other forms of violent extremism . '' saturday 's attack in el paso , texas , which is being treated as a case of domestic terrorism by federal authorities , according to the us attorney for the western district of texas , is a reminder of that long history and its particular threat today . to prevent future attacks , the united states will need to expand on the work being done by law enforcement to combat right-wing terrorism , and president donald trump will need to recognize that the threat posed by far-right terrorists is of a similar scope to that posed by jihadist terrorists . trump should also use the bully pulpit of his presidency to attack the ideological underpinnings of right-wing violence rather than stoking its flames . the united kingdom of great britain and ireland was a sovereign state established by the acts of union 1800 , which merged the kingdoms of great britain and ireland . the united kingdom , having financed the european coalition that defeated france during the napoleonic wars , developed a large royal navy that enabled the british empire to become the foremost world power for the next century . the crimean war with russia was a relatively small operation in a century where britain was largely at peace with the great powers . rapid industrialisation that began in the decades prior to the state 's formation continued up until the mid-19th century .
at the boots pure drug company in 1953 , adams began work on other chemical substances that could have a pain-killing effect , and have less side effects , centred on rheumatoid arthritis . he worked in a house in the south of nottingham for many years , as the main labs had been destroyed in the war , then moved to boots pharmaceuticals new building on pennyfoot street in 1960 where there was a radioactive lab . this is now biocity nottingham . since their inception , capsules have been viewed by consumers as the most efficient method of taking medication . for this reason , producers of drugs such as otc analgesics wanting to emphasize the strength of their product developed the `` caplet '' , a portmanteau of `` capsule-shaped tablet '' , in order to tie this positive association to more efficiently-produced tablet pills , as well as being an easier-to-swallow shape than the usual disk-shaped tablet . in march 2015 , the australian competition and consumer commission -lrb- accc -rrb- launched proceedings against reckitt benckiser ; for misleading advertising for its targeted pain range . in december 2015 , the federal court of australia found that reckitt benckiser , which makes nurofen , had misled consumers with its `` nurofen specific pain range '' , and ordered that all nurofen specific pain products be removed from retail sale within three months . a spokeswoman for reckitt benckiser argued that , '' specific-pain range '' was intended `` to help consumers navigate their pain relief options , particularly within the grocery environment where there is no healthcare professional to assist decision making '' . the accc said that the products were found to be `` no more effective at treating the type of pain described on its packaging than any of the other nurofen specific pain products '' , and sold for almost twice the price .

'' `` when people hear ` snyder cut ' in their heads , they think about , like , a dvd they 've seen of an extended cut or something that 's finished . the ` snyder cut ' that , again i have n't seen , but the one i 've heard everyone speak of was never a finished film . it was a movie that people in production could watch and fill in the blanks . it was certainly not meant for mass consumption .

consumer perception of green advertisements and greenwashing alike is impacted by where consumers attribute the green messaging . eco-labels can be given to a product both from an external organization and by the company itself , which has raised concerns considering that companies are able to label a product green or environmentally friendly by selectively disclosing positive attributes of the product while not disclosing negative environmental impacts . consumers expect to see eco-labels from both internal and external sources but perceive labels from external sources to be more trustworthy . researchers from the university of twente found that uncertified or greenwashed internal eco-labels may still contribute to consumer perceptions of a responsible company , with consumers attributing internal motivation to a company 's internal eco-labeling . global green works to create a value shift towards a sustainable future for humanity . global green is committed to working with local communities to develop a vision for a more sustainable future and solutions for climate-vulnerable neighborhoods . from building green infrastructure , to greening affordable housing , to providing innovative and effective answers to the ever-present challenges of green waste disposal , global green engages on the ground and in the meetings that matter for the future of our planet . greenwashing -lrb- a compound word modelled on `` whitewash '' -rrb- , also called `` green sheen '' , is a form of marketing spin in which green pr -lrb- green values -rrb- and green marketing are deceptively used to persuade the public that an organization 's products , aims and policies are environmentally friendly and therefore ` better ' ; appeal to nature . common examples present in the marketing of food products , alternative medicine and natural medicine .

donald trump returns to nevada wednesday for the final presidential debate in a state that is critical to his path to the white house -- and one where he has remained tied with hillary clinton despite all the turmoil rocking his campaign . nevada has been kind to trump , handing him a resounding victory in this year 's caucuses that helped him clinch the republican nomination , even though he had little in the way of a campaign apparatus and hundreds of volunteers who were entirely new to the presidential process . the republican party is trying to match the enthusiasm of trump 's nevada supporters with resources , conducting volunteer trainings all over the state this year in an effort to turn trump 's eager supporters into phone-banking and door-knocking regulars . their biggest challenge will be to catch up with the formidable democratic machine , powered by labor in a state where union power is strong . donald trump used the third and final presidential debate to dig himself into a deeper hole that only increases the threat to his presidential prospects . over the course of 90 minutes , trump scored some early hits against democratic opponent hillary clinton . but it 's one moment that will haunt the republican nominee and define the narrative heading into the campaign 's last days . `` i will look at it at the time , '' trump said when asked whether he would concede if he loses on november 8 . as this was happening , senate majority leader mitch mcconnell was quietly planning a possible trial . on october 8 , 2019 , he led a meeting on the subject , advising the republican senators to craft their responses according to their own political needs . mcconnell proposed two potential avenues : state opposition to the house process , or refuse to comment due to being potential jurors .
the us officially relocated its embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem on monday , formally upending decades of american foreign policy in a move that was met with clashes and protests along the israeli-gaza border . at least 58 palestinians were killed and more than 2,700 injured in gaza as deadly protests took place ahead of , during and after the ceremony in jerusalem , making it the deadliest day there since the 2014 gaza war . the violence could deepen tuesday , when palestinians mark what they call the `` nakba , '' or catastrophe , in memory of the more than 700,000 palestinians who were either driven from or fled their homes during the arab-israeli war that accompanied the creation of the state of israel in 1948 . on monday , which marked the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of israel , us and israeli leaders hailed the embassy move as a sign of the enduring relationship between the two countries and of us trustworthiness . the israeli military destroyed a tunnel in northern gaza with an airstrike on saturday night , according to lt. col. jonathan conricus . the 1-kilometer tunnel was only meters away from the border fence near the erez crossing into israel and a short distance away from a kibbutz , said the israel defense forces -lrb- idf -rrb- spokesman . this is the sixth tunnel destroyed in the past six months . conricus said the tunnel took months to build and that the military had been tracking its construction for a number of weeks . israeli forces killed dozens of palestinians in bloody clashes at the gaza border monday in the deadliest day there since the 2014 war , as the us officially opened its embassy in jerusalem just 50 miles away . at least 58 palestinians died , according to the palestinian health ministry , during protests over the trump administration 's controversial relocation of the embassy from tel aviv , a move that has been praised by israelis but has enraged palestinians . most of the dead were killed by israeli fire near the border . cnn journalists heard gunshots in spurts and saw a tank moving towards the fence in the border area of malaka .
in 1956 , double sessions at poly were needed until a second high school , ramona high , could be built . as high school enrollment continued to grow , it was evident that a third high school would be needed in riverside . in 1960 , a new high school , rubidoux , shared the poly campus until its campus could be completed in 1961 . in 1965 , poly separated from the junior college campus and a site on the corner of central and victoria avenues was built , along with a high school on third street and chicago avenue , named north high . the partnership is creating measures that help students across riverside earn a degree . for example , rcc will now give 2012 graduates of ausd and rusd priority class registration , and a two-year guarantee to complete an associate degree or transfer to a four-year university . completion counts is also ensuring that ausd , rusd and rcc work together to create a seamless math and english curriculum to prepare students for college-level work . high school and college student counselors are meeting regularly to agree on the best ways to get students ready for college . riverside polytechnic high school is a four-year public high school in riverside , california , united states , and part of the riverside unified school district . the current facility , located on victoria avenue , was opened in september 1965 ; the traditions of the school go back to 1887 , then known as the riverside high school , making riverside polytechnic the oldest high school in the city .
the university has buildings scattered throughout the cities of winterthur and zurich , as well as campus-like facilities in wädenswil . despite the fact that the schools and institutes are not all centrally located , students are rarely -lrb- if ever -rrb- required to relocate to other venues . 8 libraries are available for use by members of the university , as are the six on-location canteens . the collegium helveticum is an institute for advanced study . it is jointly supported and operated by the eth zurich , the university of zurich and the zurich university of the arts . it is dedicated to transdisciplinary research and acts as a think tank as well . fellows are elected for five years to work together on a particular subject . eth is a federal institute -lrb- i.e. , under direct administration by the swiss government -rrb- , whereas the university of zurich is a cantonal institution . the decision for a new federal university was heavily disputed at the time ; the liberals pressed for a `` federal university '' , while the conservative forces wanted all universities to remain under cantonal control , worried that the liberals would gain more political power than they already had . in the beginning , both universities were co-located in the buildings of the university of zurich .
on june 20 , 2000 , ground was broken for the capitol visitor center , which opened on december 2 , 2008 . from 2001 through 2008 , the east front of the capitol -lrb- site of most presidential inaugurations until ronald reagan began a new tradition in 1981 -rrb- was the site of construction for this massive underground complex , designed to facilitate a more orderly entrance for visitors to the capitol . prior to the center being built , visitors to the capitol had to line up in the basement of the cannon house office building or the russell senate office building . the new underground facility provides a grand entrance hall , a visitors theater , room for exhibits , and dining and restroom facilities , in addition to space for building necessities such as a service tunnel . the main office of the sergeant at arms is in the postal square building in washington , d.c. . the core computer operations are in that building , and the staff manage internet and intranet connections to offices of senators both in the capitol complex and back in their home states . in addition to expanding the space available for the senate 's use , the chamber 's designers were concerned that the room have acoustical and line-of-sight qualities comparable to those of a theater . the construction of the chamber began in 1851 and continued until senators began utilizing the room for legislative business in 1859 . shortly after beginning to utilize the chamber , however , senators noted the poor acoustic qualities , the sounds created by rain as it hit the glass-paneled ceiling , and uncomfortable drafts of air throughout the room .
jared fogle gives a speech at south park , touting how easy it is to lose weight by simply eating a diet of subway sandwiches . cartman , kyle , stan and butters visit jared , and are dismayed when jared reveals that his weight loss is not only the result of eating sandwiches , but also with the help from his aides -lrb- a personal trainer and a dietician -rrb- . kyle convinces jared that he is being dishonest by never referring to his assistants , and jared realizes the boys are correct , and plans to give another speech to discuss them . at jared 's next announcement , he raves about his aides . i was loaded with nine other men into a van and taken to la tuna federal correctional institution , throwing up all the way . once i was checked in , i was taken by wheelchair to my new home -- and a different type of hell in unit 6 -lrb- handicapped unit -rrb- at la tuna . the things that saved my life were my `` cellies '' -lrb- my cell mates , the other five men in the six-man cell that i was assigned to live in , a 10-by-10-foot room -rrb- . these men fed me and wheeled me to the bathroom , food service -lrb- sometimes -rrb- and to the medical office . `` jared has aides '' was written and directed by series co-creator trey parker . the episode , which heavily satirizes former subway spokesman and weight loss advocate jared fogle , was inspired by the fact that parker and stone had seen several subway commercials featuring fogle ; as parker said , `` there was a jared commercial on all the damn time , and it was getting pretty out of hand . '' the subplot from the episode , featuring butters faking losing weight in order to strike a deal to film commercials with city wok , was inspired by parker and stone wondering if fogle really lost weight by eating a diet consisting entirely of submarine sandwiches , with stone saying on the commentary that `` i could go gain 20 pounds , and then eat nothing but mcdonald 's . i just would n't eat very much mcdonald 's . ''
the town established on the chosen site was given the name of salem -lrb- from `` shalom '' meaning `` peace '' , after the canaanite city mentioned in the book of genesis -rrb- chosen for it by the moravians ' late patron , count zinzendorf . on january 6 , 1766 , the first tree was felled for the building of salem . salem was a typical moravian settlement congregation with the public buildings of the congregation grouped around a central square , today salem square . these included the church , a brethren 's house and a sisters ' house for the unmarried members of the congregation , which owned all the property in town . wesley hanes died at age fifty-three young age in 1903 , just two years after creating the business . his son , james gordon hanes , would be responsible for the 1963 merger with p. h. hanes knitting and for making hanes hosiery one of largest producers in the world of seamless stretch nylon hosiery for women . known by his middle name , wesley hanes owned the expensive clothing company in partnership with his brother , pleasant henderson hanes . using some of the proceeds of their sale of the business to r. j. reynolds tobacco company , wesley hanes went into the manufacturing of stockings while his brother set up an underwear manufacturing business under the name p.h. hanes knitting company .
deficit spending increases the money supply . the extent and the timing of budget deficits is disputed among schools of economic analysis . the mainstream view is that net spending by the public sector is inflationary in so far as it is `` financed '' by the banking system , including the central bank , and not by the sale of state debt to the public . in 1992 , lapre began broadcasting the making money show with don lapre , which suggested that viewers could make money as easily as he had . for several years the show was ranked among the ten most frequently broadcast cable television infomercials . the principal product was lapre 's `` money making secrets '' , a package of booklets , tapes , and common-sense tips for placing ads and operating a 900-number business . the product was sold through new strategies , whose parent company was tropical beaches . donald d. lapre -lrb- may 19 , 1964 -- october 2 , 2011 -rrb- was an american multi-level marketing and infomercial salesman . his work involved product packages such as `` the greatest vitamin in the world '' and `` making money secrets '' . lapre was criticized as selling questionable business plans that often did not work for his clients . in june 2011 , lapre was charged with 41 counts of conspiracy , mail fraud , wire fraud , and promotional money laundering related to his internet businesses .
the blue that appears in the background of the insignia was chosen to be `` the opposite of red , the war colour '' , although the exact shade has never been officially specified by the united nations . the original colour the group chose in 1945 was a gray blue that differs from the current united nations flag . the globe used in the original design was an azimuthal projection focused on the north pole with the united states , the host nation of the conference , at the centre . the projection that was used cut off portions of the southern hemisphere at the latitude of argentina , which was acceptable at the time , as argentina was not planned to be an original member of the united nations . a 2005 rand corporation study found the un to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts . it compared un nation-building efforts to those of the united states , and found that seven out of eight un cases are at peace . also in 2005 , the human security report documented a decline in the number of wars , genocides and human rights abuses since the end of the cold war , and presented evidence , albeit circumstantial , that international activism -- mostly spearheaded by the un -- has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict since the end of the cold war . due to its role in international politics , the united nations headquarters is often featured in movies and other pop culture . the only two films actually shot on location in the un headquarters is the glass wall -lrb- 1953 -rrb- by legendary hollywood writer/director/producer ivan tors and the interpreter -lrb- 2005 -rrb- by director sydney pollack . when he was unable to obtain permission to film in the un headquarters , director alfred hitchcock covertly filmed cary grant arriving for the 1959 feature north by northwest . after the action within the building , another scene shows grant leaving across the plaza looking down from the building 's roof .
polls conducted during 1998 and early 1999 showed that only about one-third of americans supported clinton 's impeachment or conviction . however , one year later , when it was clear that impeachment would not lead to the ousting of the president , half of americans said in a cnn/usa today/gallup poll that they supported impeachment but 57 % approved of the senate 's decision to keep him in office and two thirds of those polled said the impeachment was harmful to the country . with respect to the issues , dole promised a 15 % across-the-board reduction in income tax rates and made former congressman and supply side advocate jack kemp his running mate . bill clinton framed the narrative against dole early , painting him as a mere clone of unpopular house speaker newt gingrich , warning america that bob dole would work in concert with the republican congress to slash popular social programs , like medicare and social security , dubbed by clinton as `` dole-gingrich '' . bob dole 's tax-cut plan found itself under attack from the white house , who said it would `` blow a hole in the deficit , '' which had been cut nearly in half during his opponent 's term . bush unexpectedly came in third in the iowa caucus -lrb- that he had won back in 1980 -rrb- , behind the winner senator bob dole , and robertson . dole was also leading in the polls of the new hampshire primary , and the bush camp responded by running television commercials portraying dole as a tax raiser , while governor john h. sununu stumped for bush . these efforts enabled the vice president to defeat dole and gain crucial momentum . embittered by his loss in new hampshire , dole told bush directly , on live television that evening , to `` stop lying about my record . ''
a week later , shabazz was at manhattan 's audubon ballroom , with her mother and sisters , when her father was assassinated . she was six at the time and reportedly the only one of his children who has clear memories of him . in 2005 , she told journalist gabe pressman that she remembered the events of that day `` vividly '' : both frank and yolanda were christian scientists . yolanda always carried a knitted bag with her that held the bible and science and health . she attended the same christian science church as ginger rogers for many years . off stage , she was quiet and modest , and wore plain clothes , saying that `` pretty '' clothes were for her performances . o'neill was a leading opponent of the reagan administration 's domestic and defense policies . following the 1980 election , with the u.s. senate controlled by republicans , o'neill became the leader of the congressional opposition . o'neill even went as far as calling ronald reagan `` the most ignorant man who had ever occupied the white house '' . o'neill also said that reagan was `` herbert hoover with a smile '' and `` a cheerleader for selfishness . ''
when casting the leads , tarantino invited pitt , dicaprio , and robbie to his house to read the only copy of the full script , to prevent leaks . when butler auditioned , he did not know which character it was for . tarantino told him it was for a villain or a hero on lancer , when in fact it was for `` tex '' watson . to prepare for her audition , maya hawke practiced with her father , ethan hawke . as a writer , i demand the right to write any character in the world that i want to write . i demand the right to be them , i demand the right to think them and i demand the right to tell the truth as i see they are , all right ? and to say that i ca n't do that because i 'm white , but the hughes brothers can do that because they 're black , that is racist . that is the heart of racism , all right . in november 2013 , tarantino said he was working on a new film and that it would be another western . he stated that it would not be a sequel to django . on january 12 , 2014 , it was revealed that the film would be titled the hateful eight . production of the western would most likely have begun in the summer of 2014 , but after the script for the film leaked in january 2014 , tarantino considered dropping the movie and publishing it as a novel instead .
joshu roshi told me i would never get enlightened if i thought about these things . i was told by one osho and one senior student i would be blamed for joshu roshi 's death if i tried to make him change his behavior , and that i would be responsible for ruining his legacy . `` you are killing him ! '' was shouted at me more than once . it was n't until his inji , who was engaged to be married , came bursting into my room at bodhi mandala in new mexico after lunch one day during an autumn sesshin , sobbing and saying , `` he wo n't leave me alone '' , that it finally dawned on me that this was real . until then i truly did not believe any of the rumors because of my own conditioned ignorance . in 2008 , sewell appeared in the hbo miniseries john adams as alexander hamilton . he received critical praise for his portrayal of charles ii in the bbc 's charles ii : the power and the passion . the series ' cast included ian mcdiarmid , helen mccrory , rupert graves and shirley henderson and spanned the life of the king from his last days in exile to his death . he co-starred in the controversial film downloading nancy , which was released on 5 june 2009 .
in 2000 and again in 2004 , time magazine named george w. bush as its person of the year , a title awarded to someone who the editors believe `` has done the most to influence the events of the year '' . in may 2004 , gallup reported that 89 percent of the republican electorate approved of bush . however , the support waned due mostly to a minority of republicans ' frustration with him on issues of spending , illegal immigration , and middle eastern affairs . in april of 2008 , bush 's disapproval ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70-year history of the gallup poll , with 69 percent of those polled disapproving of the job bush was doing as president and 28 percent approving -- although the majority -lrb- 66 percent -rrb- of republicans still approved of his job performance . gallup 's poll is announced during the last week of each year , and the results typically gets mainstream media coverage at the time . the survey has been considered , in part , a test of name recognition . while places at the top of the list are often predictable , scholars have found appearances further down in the top ten to be illuminating , such as in 1958 when segregationist governor orval faubus made the list in the wake of the little rock nine civil rights episode .

a unique voting group from the 2016 election -- voters who backed independent vermont sen. bernie sanders but were willing to vote for donald trump -- seems to be non-existent in the early days of the latest presidential contest . trump 's june 2015 entrance into the presidential election quickly turned that race from a debate over candidates ' ideology into a question of whether voters wanted a political insider or outsider as the successor to president barack obama . perhaps no group of voters signified that debate more than those who preferred sanders -lrb- a progressive independent who was seen at the time as further left than the mainstream democratic party -rrb- but were willing to vote for trump -lrb- a billionaire espousing conservative positions who took over the republican party with his bellicose rhetoric and take-no-prisoners political style -rrb- . those who wanted to link trump -- with his promise to `` drain the swamp '' and anti-elite message -- and sanders often called them `` populists '' and `` anti-establishment . '' the latest cnn/des moines register/mediacom iowa poll is undoubtedly good news for former vice president joe biden and sen. bernie sanders as the two lead the large pack of possible contenders for the democratic nomination for president in 2020 . but the poll also reveals strengths and weaknesses for those two and several other democratic contenders . biden for biden , it 's mostly a positive picture . the new poll shows him with 81 % favorability among likely democratic caucusgoers . the latest cnn/des moines register/mediacom 2020 iowa poll shows former vice president joe biden continuing to lead the pack with 27 % and sen. bernie sanders close behind with 25 % . sanders is up from our last poll , though the relative order remains the same . no other candidate reaches double-digits . but beyond these topline numbers , the poll reveals some interesting trends in the electorate .

her writing for the monthly includes a feature on the forgotten australians , the 500,000 australians that received institutionalized or other care in the 20th century , and another about questionable real estate news coverage . her story about digital archiving for an politics and arts publication won her australian society of archivists ' mander jones award . her work for the new scientist includes an article about the debate about the impact of the human genome project and the unspecialness of being human . more recent research has also explored writing development . myhill concentrated on the development of written language skills in adolescents aged 13 to 15 . myhill discovered that the more mature writer was aware of the shaping of text , and used non-finite clauses , which mirrored perera 's results -lrb- 1984 -rrb- . other researchers focused on writing development up until late adolescence , as there has been a limited research in this area . her first book , the first word : the search for the origins of language , is about the relatively new field of evolutionary linguistics starring such figures as cognitive scientist philip lieberman , primatologist sue savage-rumbaugh , psychologists steven pinker and paul bloom , and evolutionary biologists tecumseh fitch and marc hauser . she interviewed all of these scientists for the book . lieberman a former student of noam chomsky broke from his mentor 's insistence that language could not be explained by evolutionary theory . among other work , he studied the human brain to find support for the idea that language evolved from organs like the basal ganglia that human beings share with members of other species .
monsanto , headquartered in creve coeur , missouri , is the largest producer of genetically engineered seed . monsanto has been involved in high-profile lawsuits , as both plaintiff and defendant , and its current and former biotechnology products , its lobbying of government agencies , and its history as a chemical company have made it a controversial corporation . in the united states , the majority of corn , soybean , and cotton is genetically modified . brprior to the march , monsanto 's ceo hugh grant had accused opponents of genetically modified foods of wanting to block others from choosing more affordable food options , thus being guilty of `` elitism '' . in the late 1960s , the monsanto plant in sauget , illinois , was the nation 's largest producer of pcbs , which remained in the water along dead creek there . an epa official referred to sauget as `` one of the most polluted communities in the region '' and `` a soup of different chemicals '' . the supreme court of canada had issued a similar decision in monsanto canada inc. v. schmeiser -lrb- 2004 -rrb- . that case concerned percy schmeiser , who claimed to have discovered that some canola growing on his farm in 1997 was roundup resistant . schmeiser harvested the seed from the roundup resistant plants , and planted the seed in 1998 . monsanto sued schmeiser for patent infringement for the 1998 planting .
president donald trump has a lot to say about the ongoing special counsel investigation into russian meddling into the 2016 campaign . he 's called it a `` phony russian witch hunt '' and the `` russia hoax '' story . trump 's lawyers have been building what amounts to an opposition research file on robert mueller , the head of the special counsel investigation , and the rest of his team . by contrast , mueller and his investigators have been totally silent . president donald trump told reporters on thursday that he has n't given firing special counsel robert mueller any thought , despite people close to him telling reporters that the president is considering firing the man investigating russian meddling in the 2016 election . `` i have n't given it any thought , '' he said . `` i 've been reading about it from you people . you say , ` oh , i 'm going to dismiss him . ' after the news broke out in late january 2018 , that trump ordered don mcgahn to fire robert mueller in june 2017 , trump pressured mcgahn to deny the reports . `` after the story broke , the president , through his personal counsel and two aides , sought to have mcgahn deny that he had been directed to remove the special counsel , '' the report reads . trump told then-white house staff secretary rob porter to tell mcgahn to create a record that makes clear trump never directed mcgahn to fire the special counsel . `` porter thought the matter should be handled by the white house communications office , but the president said he wanted mcgahn to write a letter to the file ` for our records ' and wanted something beyond a press statement to demonstrate that the reporting was inaccurate .
matthew 's account has parallels in luke 7:1 -- 10 and john 4:46 -- 53 . there are major differences between john 's account and those of the two synoptic writers , but such differences exist also between the two synoptic accounts , with next to nothing of the details in luke 7:2 -- 6 being present also in matthew . the commentary of craig a. evans states that the word pais used by matthew may be that used in the hypothetical source known as q used by both matthew and luke and , since it can mean either son or slave , it became doulos -lrb- slave -rrb- in luke and huios -lrb- son -rrb- in john . writers who admit john 4:46 -- 53 as a parallel passage generally interpret matthew 's pais as `` child '' or `` boy '' , while those who exclude it see it as meaning `` servant '' or `` slave '' . the original bible text is , according to catholics , `` written by the inspired author himself and has more authority and greater weight than any , even the very best , translation whether ancient or modern '' . the old testament has always been central to the life of the christian church . bible scholar n.t. wright says `` jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures . '' he adds that the earliest christians also searched those same hebrew scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of jesus .
the wsr-88d doppler weather radar system , also called nexrad , was developed by the national weather service during the mid-1980s , and fully deployed throughout the majority of the united states by 1997 . there are 158 such radar sites in operation in the u.s. , its various territorial possessions and selected overseas locations . this technology , because of its high resolution and ability to detect intra-cloud motions , is now the cornerstone of the agency 's severe weather warning operations . the national weather service -lrb- nws -rrb- is an agency of the united states federal government that is tasked with providing weather forecasts , warnings of hazardous weather , and other weather-related products to organizations and the public for the purposes of protection , safety , and general information . it is a part of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- branch of the department of commerce , and is headquartered in silver spring , maryland , within the washington metropolitan area . the agency was known as the united states weather bureau from 1890 until it adopted its current name in 1970 . the nws performs its primary task through a collection of national and regional centers , and 122 local weather forecast offices -lrb- wfos -rrb- . as the nws is an agency of the u.s. federal government , most of its products are in the public domain and available free of charge . in situations where a forecaster indicates a significant threat of extremely severe and life-threatening weather with an ongoing local weather event , enhanced wording may be used to note the heightened threat by a significant local storm event . in april 2012 , the nws introduced the impact based warning system at its weather forecast offices in wichita and topeka , kansas , and springfield , st. louis and kansas city/pleasant hill , missouri ; the pilot project -- which would expand to 80 weather forecast offices overseen by the central , eastern , southern and western region headquarters by the spring of 2015 -- incorporate message tags within the main body of the product describing the source of the hazard report , damage potential , and if applicable , radar indications or physical observations of tornadoes or the possibility of a tornado ; hazards are also summarized at the close of the product text -lrb- describing estimated maximum hail size and wind gusts , and if applicable , if a storm has the potential to produce a tornado or in the event of a tornado warning , the basis of the warning or its damage threat -rrb- . the wording `` particularly dangerous situation '' -lrb- pds -rrb- , which originated by the storm prediction center for use in tornado watch products during expected high-end severe weather outbreaks , is subjectively issued . it is occasionally issued with tornado warnings , normally if a large tornado capable of producing ef3 to ef5 damage or staying on the ground for long-duration -- sometimes uninterrupted -- paths has been reported -lrb- although a tornado emergency may be issued in such cases if the tornado is expected to track into a densely populated area -rrb- .

a special counsel investigation led by robert mueller found that trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged russian foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election under the belief that it would be politically advantageous , but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of criminal conspiracy or coordination with russia . mueller also investigated trump for obstruction of justice , and his report neither indicted nor exonerated trump on that count . a 2019 house impeachment inquiry found that trump solicited foreign interference in the 2020 u.s. presidential election from ukraine to help his re-election bid and then obstructed the inquiry itself . the inquiry reported that he withheld military aid and a white house invitation in order to influence ukraine to publicly announce investigations into his political rivals . on june 19 , 2017 , two days after trump tried to have don mcgahn fire the special counsel , trump went to sessions . trump had a one-on-one meeting in the oval office with corey lewandowski , former trump campaign manager who was not working for the government . trump wanted lewandowski to deliver a message to sessions that would `` have had the effect of limiting the russia investigation to future election interference only '' . the report relays that trump told lewandowski `` that sessions was weak and that if the president had known about the likelihood of recusal in advance , he would not have appointed sessions '' . robert mueller 's report could land within days , yet rather than offering definitive answers , his hotly anticipated filing might only ignite a new controversy -- over how much of the special counsel 's conclusions most americans get to see . sources told cnn on wednesday that the justice department is preparing for mueller to report to attorney general bill barr as soon as next week after an investigation that started as an attempt to find out whether trump campaign members conspired with a russian election meddling effort . but the big question is how much of what the special counsel concludes -- after an investigation repeatedly blasted as a `` hoax '' and a `` witch hunt '' by the president -- will be made public or even sent to congress . whenever it is filed , mueller 's report will mark a critical point in the trump presidency , given the gravity of the accusations against his team , and offer the theoretical possibility of conclusive answers about the last white house race .
the school has seen many names over the years , changing from the `` state normal and industrial school '' to the state normal and industrial college in 1896 , and again in 1919 to north carolina college for women . in 1932 , it changed to the woman 's college of the university of north carolina , when it became one of the three charter institutions of the consolidated university of north carolina , and changed again to the university of north carolina at greensboro when men were first admitted to the school in 1963 . it is remembered fondly by many graduates of the woman 's college simply as `` the w.c. '' this week , the world 's largest gathering of aids doctors and experts is converging on washington for the 19th international aids conference . it marks the first time in 22 years that the biannual event will be held on u.s. soil , possible only because a 25-year-old travel ban preventing hiv-positive people from entering the country was lifted by president barack obama in 2009 and went into effect a year later . the significance of that move is not lost on researchers all over the country . more than 25,000 doctors , scientists , aids activists , politicians , philanthropists , drug company representatives , people living with hiv and heads of state from around the world are attending the weeklong conference . the history of the school of education of uncg has its roots in the founding of the university itself . originally designated in 1891 as the north carolina state normal and industrial school , uncg was established as a school to train women educators , based on the assumption that if women received training they would , in turn , educate their children and ultimately improve the level of education and literacy in the state .
the weekend massacre at an upscale shopping center in kenya is shining a new light on an old concern for western counterterrorism officials : the recruitment of jihadist fighters from somali communities in the united states , canada , and europe . it 's a concern all too familiar for many somali-american families in minneapolis , minnesota , where young men have been slipping away to join the al qaeda-affiliated guerrilla group al-shabaab for the past few years , sometimes in groups . several have died , their relatives learning of their deaths in cryptic phone calls or in messages posted online . one of those killed was burhan hassan , who was killed fighting in somalia . a new permanent span over washington state 's skagit river reopened sunday , some four months after a bridge collapse on interstate 5 . the bridge 's failure in late may sent cars tumbling into the river and severed the state 's main artery to canada , on which trucks carry an estimated $ 13.9 billion annually in cargo . a temporary span went up within a few weeks . ntsb : ` boom , ' then shudder , first sign of problem on bridge roughly 70,000 vehicles a day travel on interstate 5 over the bridge , said the state department of transportation , which announced the reopening on its facebook page . canada is a country in the northern part of north america . its ten provinces and three territories extend from the atlantic to the pacific and northward into the arctic ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres -lrb- 3.85 million square miles -rrb- , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . its southern border with the united states , stretching some 8,891 kilometres -lrb- 5,525 mi -rrb- , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . canada 's capital is ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are toronto , montreal , and vancouver .
wherever i go , terror seems to follow . i used to go jogging by westminster bridge when i lived in london , and my office was just a few blocks away from the world trade center when i lived in new york . i do n't know how many hundreds of times i have walked where terrorism took innocent lives . i also studied in paris , just a few blocks away from the bataclan and république , sites of the 2015 attacks that left over a hundred people dead and many more injured . on thursday afternoon , a van rammed into a crowd of people in barcelona , killing 13 people and injuring at least 100 . it 's the worst attack on spanish soil since the 2004 madrid bombings , which killed 191 people and injured more than 1,800 . the deadly assault was followed hours later by a second possible terror attack in cambrils , south of barcelona , where police shot dead five suspected terrorists . as police search for answers , here 's what we know so far . the football world has united in paying tribute to the victims of thursday 's barcelona attacks which killed 14 people and injured at least 100 . lionel messi , who plays for barcelona football club and is one of the world 's most revered players , sent his condolences to the families and friends of the victims , saying he totally rejected `` any act of violence , '' while real madrid 's cristiano ronaldo and other world stars also offered their sympathy . barcelona and real madrid , spain 's biggest football clubs , both held a minute 's silence before training on friday . the attack on las ramblas , a predominantly pedestrian zone in the heart of the catalan capital , was the worst on spanish soil since the 2004 madrid bombings , which killed 191 people and injured more than 1,800 .
on 6 june 2013 , britain 's the guardian newspaper began publishing a series of revelations by an unnamed american whistleblower , revealed several days later to be former cia and nsa-contracted systems analyst edward snowden . snowden gave a cache of internal documents in support of his claims to two journalists : glenn greenwald and laura poitras , greenwald later estimated that the cache contains 15,000 -- 20,000 documents , some very large and very detailed , and some very small . this was one of the largest news leaks in the modern history of the united states . in over two months of publications , it became clear that the nsa operates a complex web of spying programs which allow it to intercept internet and telephone conversations from over a billion users from dozens of countries around the world . edward joseph snowden -lrb- born june 21 , 1983 -rrb- is an american whistleblower who copied and leaked highly classified information from the national security agency -lrb- nsa -rrb- in 2013 when he was a central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- employee and subcontractor . his disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs , many run by the nsa and the five eyes intelligence alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and european governments , and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy . in 2013 , snowden was hired by an nsa contractor , booz allen hamilton , after previous employment with dell and the cia . snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored . snowden met with barton gellman of the washington post six months after the disclosure for an exclusive interview spanning 14 hours , his first since being granted temporary asylum . snowden talked about his life in russia as `` an indoor cat , '' reflected on his time as an nsa contractor , and discussed at length the revelations of global surveillance and their reverberations . snowden said , `` in terms of personal satisfaction , the mission 's already accomplished ... i already won .
during his campaign , biden focused on the war in iraq and his support for the implementation of the biden-gelb plan to achieve political success . he touted his record in the senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy . despite speculation to the contrary , biden rejected the notion of accepting the position of secretary of state , focusing only on the presidency . at a 2007 campaign event , biden said , `` i know a lot of my opponents out there say i 'd be a great secretary of state . since shortly following biden 's withdrawal from the presidential race , obama had been privately telling biden he was interested in finding an important place for him in a possible obama administration . biden declined obama 's first request to vet him for the vice presidential slot , fearing the vice presidency would represent a loss in status and voice from his senate position , but subsequently changed his mind . in a june 22 , 2008 , interview on nbc 's meet the press , biden confirmed that , although he was not actively seeking a spot on the ticket , he would accept the vice presidential nomination if offered . in early august , obama and biden met in secret to discuss a possible vice-presidential relationship , and the two developed a strong personal rapport . on january 31 , 2007 as biden entered the presidential race he attacked frontrunner hillary clinton 's plan for the war in iraq . during an interview on good morning america , biden called clinton 's plan `` a disaster '' and `` counterproductive '' . biden stated that his plan called for a `` political solution '' unlike clinton 's `` military solution '' . biden praised hillary clinton as a presidential candidate , calling her `` fully qualified '' .

will tracy , an associate editor at the onion , told the new york times in 2010 that the office of the vice president had sent the onion staff an email with the message `` keep it up . he really likes it . '' tracy commented , `` apparently he 's a fan . '' biden 's office denied being aware of any communication between the vice president and the onion . after lucy flores published an essay in 2019 alleging biden had inappropriately kissed and touched her , there was renewed attention on other allegations that biden has made inappropriate physical contact with women . in turn , the increased attention on the issue prompted critical reassessments of the onion 's portrayal of biden , particularly the character 's interactions with women . antonia farzan at the washington post said some of the older headlines about biden and women -- like `` biden invokes freedom of information act to find out when woman gets off work '' and `` biden invites nation 's women to tax code discussion at private mountain chalet '' -- had `` a sharper edge now that multiple women have said that biden 's close physical contact at public events made them feel uncomfortable .

the ntsb investigated the relationship between crew performance and the events in the accident . : 73 faa regulations require a sterile cockpit before takeoff , which means there is to be no conversation unrelated to the aircraft and pending flight . however , the cockpit voice recorder -lrb- cvr -rrb- tapes recorded extensive nonessential conversation , including about the cvr itself , the crash of continental airlines flight 1713 , and the dating habits of the flight attendants . the cvr also showed that prior to takeoff , the flight crew was distracted by chatting with a flight attendant about the upcoming presidential election , drink mixes , and various other topics unrelated to the operation of the aircraft . as part of the re-branding project , a safety video featuring a flight attendant showed up on youtube in early 2008 , getting over 1 million views and the attention of news outlets , specifically for the video 's tone mixed with the serious safety message . the flight attendant , katherine lee , was dubbed `` deltalina '' by a member of flyertalk for her resemblance to angelina jolie . delta had considered several styles for its current safety video , including animation , before opting for a video presenting a flight attendant speaking to the audience . the video was filmed on a former song airlines boeing 757-200 . based on the lack of warning sounds on the cvr , the ntsb also determined that the plane 's take-off warning system -lrb- tows -rrb- , designed to alert the crew if the engines are throttled to take-off power without the flaps and slats being correctly set , failed to alert the pilots to their improper takeoff configuration . : 71 the switch that operated the tows in the incident aircraft had been previously modified , per boeing instructions , to prevent nuisance activations during aircraft taxiing . : 36 a fleet-wide boeing 727 inspection , ordered by the federal aviation administration following the flight 1141 crash , identified 35 anomalies in the tows out of 1,190 aircraft examined . : 40 the faa had recommended that the boeing 727 tows be changed from a system activated by the aircraft throttles to one activated by engine pressure ratio -lrb- epr -rrb- , and while delta owned boeing 727s that had an epr-activated tows , these were all aircraft that delta had acquired from other airlines , and delta did not convert its own aircraft to an epr-activated system .

new york magazine reported that executive editor jill abramson `` put on a full-court press '' to keep silver at the times and that `` for abramson , silver was a tentpole attraction for her favorite subject , national politics , and brought the kind of buzz she thought valuable '' , but the company 's ceo and president mark thompson `` confirmed that keeping silver was not at the top of his agenda '' . the article stated that `` the major reason silver left was because he felt it was thompson who had not committed to building his franchise . the mixed signals from thompson and abramson -- his lack of enthusiasm for committing resources to silver , her desire to keep a major star -- frustrated silver and his lawyer '' . in 1797 , patrick colquhoun was able to persuade the west indies merchants who operated at the pool of london on the river thames , to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £ 500,000 worth of cargo . the idea of a police , as it then existed in france , was considered as a potentially undesirable foreign import . in building the case for the police in the face of england 's firm anti-police sentiment , colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was `` perfectly congenial to the principle of the british constitution '' . moreover , he went so far as to praise the french system , which had reached `` the greatest degree of perfection '' in his estimation . edwin chadwick 's 1829 article , `` preventive police '' in the london review , argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body , which was not the case in practice . the reason , argued chadwick , was that `` a preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation .

according to martin heidegger we do not exist inside time , we are time . hence , the relationship to the past is a present awareness of having been , which allows the past to exist in the present . the relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility , task , or engagement . it is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned , which causes `` being ahead of oneself '' when thinking of a pending occurrence . not long after tebow 's retirement from the nfl , beginning in 2016 and continuing through the next two or three years , there was a controversy over football players kneeling during the pre-game national anthem . the normally outspoken tebow , who was still very much in the public eye as a tv commentator during those years , stayed out of that controversy . most of the players involved were his former opponents or teammates . in a 2018 interview , he explained that he never kneeled during the anthem , and that `` it was never something i did to take away from somebody else . in 2001 , the two compiled a tape of many of their shorts and submitted it to various comedic heroes , including bob odenkirk of mr. show , who reacted to their work with enthusiasm and agreed to collaborate with them on a pilot of tom goes to the mayor . the pilot was submitted to adult swim who offered to turn the short into a series which ran on the network for two seasons . their next project with adult swim was the sketch program , tim and eric awesome show , great job ! , which ran for five seasons and established a cult following for the duo . they released a cd with music from awesome show entitled tim and eric awesome record , great songs !

speaking at a `` becoming '' tour stop for her best-selling memoir at barclays center in brooklyn on saturday , michelle obama used language we 're not used to hearing from a former first lady . obama said the idea that `` you can have it all '' is `` a lie . '' `` it 's not always enough to lean in , '' she said , referencing facebook coo sheryl sandberg 's book of the same name . `` because that s -- does n't work all the time . '' the social problems associated with poverty , from crime to drug addiction , have plagued the area for decades . despite the decline of crime compared to its peak during the crack and heroin epidemics , violent crime continues to be a serious problem in the community , especially gang-related gun violence . empty lots and unused storefronts are common in brownsville due to high rates of crime , mostly in the area 's public housing developments . a reporter for the new york times observed that some of the area 's playgrounds were inadequately maintained with broken lights and unlocked gates , and that shootings were common in these public housing developments . the brt did not run any elevated train through services from 1899 to 1901 . due to increased patronage after the opening of the interborough rapid transit company -lrb- irt -rrb- 's first subway line , the park row station was rebuilt in 1906 . at one point , there were plans for brooklyn bridge elevated trains to run underground to the brt 's proposed chambers street station in manhattan , though work on the connection was never completed . the overpass across william street was closed in 1913 to make way for the proposed connection .
on october 1 , 2009 , bay revealed that dark of the moon had already gone into pre-production , and its planned release was back to its originally intended date of july 1 , 2011 , rather than 2012 . due to the revived interest in 3-d technology brought in by the success of avatar , talks between paramount , ilm , and bay had considered the possibility of the next transformers film being filmed in 3-d , and testing was performed to bring the technology into bay 's work . bay originally was not much interested in the format as he felt it did not fit his `` aggressive style '' of filmmaking , but he was convinced after talks with avatar director james cameron , who even offered the technical crew from that film . cameron reportedly told bay about 3-d , `` you got ta look at it as a toy , it 's another fun tool to help get emotion and character and create an experience . '' due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards , many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the `` oscar season '' . this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than by quality . william friedkin , an academy award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony , expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in 2009 , describing it as `` the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself '' . american director and producer michael bay started his career directing music videos and commercials . this included a commercial for the american red cross in 1992 which received a clio award , and music videos for donny osmond , styx and meat loaf . jerry bruckheimer recognizing his achievements on commercials offered him the chance to direct one of his productions as bay 's feature film debut . bay did so with bruckheimer 's action comedy bad boys starring will smith , and martin lawrence .
for years , johns hopkins has been among the nation 's top medical schools in the number of competitive research grants awarded by the national institutes of health . according to u.s. news and world report , johns hopkins ranks # 2 among research-oriented medical schools , and has always ranked in the top 3 . its major teaching hospital , the johns hopkins hospital , was ranked the top hospital in the united states every year from 1991 to 2011 by u.s. news & world report . international business times named an md from johns hopkins one of the five most prestigious degrees in the world . after the civil war and during reconstruction , johns hopkins ' stance on abolitionism infuriated many prominent people in baltimore . during the american reconstruction period to his death his abolitionism was expressed in the documents founding the johns hopkins institutions , and reported in newspaper articles before , during , and after the founding of these institutions . before the war , there was significant written opposition to his support for myrtilla miner 's founding of a school for african american females -lrb- now the university of the district of columbia -rrb- . similarly , opposition -lrb- and some support -rrb- was expressed during reconstruction , such as in 1867 , the same year he filed papers incorporating the johns hopkins institutions , when he attempted unsuccessfully to stop the convening of the maryland constitutional convention where the democratic party came into power and where a new state constitution , the constitution still in effect , was voted to replace the 1864 constitution of the radical republicans previously in power . in 1893 , johns hopkins university was one of the first medical schools to admit women . the decision to begin coeducation was a result of a shortage of funds , as the b&o railroad stock that was supposed to cover cost was used up in building the hospital in 1889 and the medical school had not yet been built . four of the original trustees ' daughters offered to raise the money needed to open the school , but only if the school agreed to admit qualified women to the university . after several discussions the trustees agreed to their terms and accepted the financial help of these four women , with only one of the doctors , william henry welch resisting .

organic farming is widely perceived to be a healthy , more environmentally-friendly alternative to conventional agricultural techniques . but its role in providing for an increasingly crowded planet remains unclear with its merits hotly contested . new research looks set to refuel the debate revealing yields from organic farming to be , on average , 25 % lower than conventionally-farmed produce . reporting in the science journal nature , researchers from canada 's mcgill university and the u.s. 's university of minnesota say that the differences are not uniform across every crop with some performing better than others . inventions by university of minnesota students and faculty have ranged from food science to health technologies . most of the public research funding in minnesota is funneled to the university of minnesota as a result of long-standing advocacy by the university itself . the rhedc eventually identified the need for a branch campus of the university of minnesota system that could integrate with the health sciences programs and needs of the mayo clinic . the group promoted the university of minnesota system as the only higher education provider in a position to carry out this ideal , in spite of the existing branch campus of winona state university - rochester and rochester community and technical college . the rhedc report was drafted and delivered to the legislature and the governor . the recommendations of the report were adopted by the governor , the legislature and the university of minnesota board of regents .
television production made up much of the studio 's output , with universal heavily committed , in particular , to deals with nbc -lrb- which much later merged with universal to form nbc universal ; see below -rrb- providing up to half of all prime time shows for several seasons . an innovation during this period championed by universal was the made-for-television movie . in 1982 , universal became the studio base for many shows that were produced by norman lear 's tandem productions/embassy television , including diff'rent strokes , one day at a time , the jeffersons , the facts of life , and silver spoons which premiered on nbc that same fall . reprise was heavily in debt at the time of the takeover , and the warner records management team was reportedly dismayed at their balance sheet being pushed back into the red by the acquisition , but they were given no choice in the matter . ben kalmenson , a warner bros. company director and close aide to jack warner , summoned the label 's directors to a meeting in new york and explicitly told them that both he and warner wanted the deal and that they expected them to vote in favor of it . warner bros. returned to the record business in 1958 with the establishment of its own recording division , warner bros. . records . by this time , the established hollywood studios were reeling from multiple challenges to their former dominance -- the most notable being the introduction of television in the late 1940s . legal changes also had a major impact on their business -- lawsuits brought by major stars had effectively overthrown the old studio contract system by the late 1940s ; warner bros. . pictures sold off much of its film library in 1948 -lrb- although , ironically , time warner 's 1996 takeover of turner broadcasting returned most of the warner archive to the company -rrb- and , beginning in 1949 , anti-trust suits brought by the us government forced the five major studios to divest their cinema chains .
the first , regularly scheduled , american television newscast in history was made by nbc news on february 21 , 1940 , anchored by lowell thomas -lrb- 1892-1981 -rrb- , and airing weeknights at 6:45 p.m. . it was simply lowell thomas in front of a television camera while doing his nbc network radio broadcast , the television simulcast seen only in new york . in june 1940 , nbc , through its flagship station in new york city , w2xbs -lrb- renamed commercial wnbt in 1941 , now wnbc -rrb- operating on channel one , televised 30 1/4 hours of coverage of the republican national convention live and direct from philadelphia . the station used a series of relays from philadelphia to new york and on to upper new york state , for rebroadcast on w2xb in schenectady -lrb- now wrgb -rrb- , making this among the first `` network '' programs of nbc television . nbc 's vice president of news and public affairs , j. davidson taylor , was a southerner who , with producer reuven frank , was determined that nbc would lead television 's coverage of the civil rights movement . in 1955 , nbc provided national coverage of rev. martin luther king , jr. 's leadership of the bus boycott in montgomery , alabama , airing reports from frank mcgee , then news director of nbc 's montgomery affiliate wsfa-tv , who would later join the network . a year later , john chancellor 's coverage of the admission of black students to central high school in little rock , arkansas was the first occasion when the key news story came from television rather than print and prompted a prominent u.s. senator to observe later , `` when i think of little rock , i think of john chancellor .

the oval office has become associated in americans ' minds with the presidency itself through memorable images , such as a young john f. kennedy , jr. peering through the front panel of his father 's desk , president richard nixon speaking by telephone with the apollo 11 astronauts during their moonwalk , and amy carter bringing her siamese cat misty malarky ying yang to brighten her father president jimmy carter 's day . several presidents have addressed the nation from the oval office on occasion . examples include kennedy presenting news of the cuban missile crisis -lrb- 1962 -rrb- , nixon announcing his resignation from office -lrb- 1974 -rrb- , ronald reagan following the space shuttle challenger disaster -lrb- 1986 -rrb- , and george w. bush in the wake of the september 11 attacks -lrb- 2001 -rrb- . in 2018 , former white house stenographer beck dorey-stein published a memoir about her years working for obama called from the corner of the oval . traditionally , the addresses are delivered with the president sitting at the resolute desk speaking into the camera . occasionally , however , the president will stand at a lectern on the opposite side of the oval office and give the address . previously , it was also common for an artificial background to be placed behind the president , ordinarily consisting of plain blue fabric . since the administration of jimmy carter , the preference has instead been for the natural backdrop of the office 's windows . the september 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in bush 's presidency . that evening , he addressed the nation from the oval office , promising a strong response to the attacks . he also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims . three days after the attacks , bush visited ground zero and met with mayor rudy giuliani , firefighters , police officers , and volunteers .
a federal bankruptcy judge denied american airlines ' plan to give its ceo a $ 20 million severance package , saying bankruptcy law prevents such rich `` golden parachutes . '' but the airline says it will continue to push for ceo tom horton to get the payoff . and the judge left the door open to reconsider the request in future , or for the company to approve the windfall for horton once its merger with us airways is complete . horton is losing his ceo position when american and us airways merge , which is expected to take place later this year . two pilots , an american and a canadian , were killed saturday when the small aircraft they were flying crashed into a house in guyana , officials said . the pilots , whose names were not released , were the only people on board the six-seat plane . their piper aztec twin-engine aircraft had just taken off from guyana 's ogle airport when it encountered engine trouble , according to robeson benn , the south american country 's minister of transport . the plane crashed into a house in the coastal village of sparendaam , about 5 miles -lrb- 8 kilometers -rrb- east of the capital city of georgetown , authorities said . the brooklyn nets are an american professional basketball team based in the new york city borough of brooklyn . the nets compete in the national basketball association -lrb- nba -rrb- as a member of the atlantic division of the eastern conference . the team plays its home games at barclays center . they are one of two nba teams located in new york city ; the other is the new york knicks .
libby and dan later marry . during an interview , susan bower said that there is nothing interesting in watching an on-screen marriage that is working and she highlighted her plans for the couple ; `` it 's a very , very slow , long burn and there 's some wonderful humour and the fact there 's the brady bunch a bit . we are making stories about what happens in people 's lives and there 's the good and the bad .

on march 30 , 1981 , while bush was in texas , reagan was shot and seriously wounded by john hinckley jr. . bush immediately flew back from washington d.c. ; when his plane landed , his aides advised him to proceed directly to the white house by helicopter in order to show that the government was still functioning . bush rejected the idea , as he feared that such a dramatic scene risked giving the impression that he sought to usurp reagan 's powers and prerogatives . during reagan 's short period of incapacity , bush presided over cabinet meetings , met with congressional leaders and foreign leaders , and briefed reporters , but he consistently rejected the possibility of invoking the twenty-fifth amendment . bush 's handling of the attempted assassination and its aftermath made a positive impression on reagan , who recovered and returned to work within two weeks of the shooting . in an article that same month , time magazine accused the bush administration of making desperate attempts to distance themselves from the scandal . according to author frank pellegrini , various bush appointments held connections to enron , including deputy white house chief of staff karl rove as a stockholder , secretary of the army thomas white jr. as a former executive , and sec chairman harvey pitt , a former employee of arthur andersen . former montana governor marc racicot , whom bush considered for appointment for secretary of the interior , briefly served as a lobbyist for the company after leaving office . after opening a criminal investigation into the scandal , attorney general john ashcroft recused himself and his chief of staff from the case when democratic congressman henry waxman accused ashcroft of receiving $ 25,000 from enron for his failed reelection campaign to the senate in 2000 . kenneth lay was a longtime supporter of u.s. president george w. bush and a donor to his various political campaigns , including his successful bid for the presidency in 2000 . as such , critics of bush and his administration attempted to link them to the scandal . a january 2002 article in the economist claimed that lay had been a close personal friend of bush 's family and had backed him financially since his unsuccessful campaign for congress in 1978 . allegedly , lay was even rumored at one point to be in the running to serve as secretary of energy for bush .
after paul 's death in 1910 , he was succeeded by his son , joseph krug ii . however , during world war i joseph ii was taken prisoner and his wife jeanne played a key role in the house , at a time when the western front divided the region between the allies and the germans . after the war , joseph ii 's slow recovery led to his nephew jean seydoux becoming joint manager in 1924 . in that decade , too , the krug 1926 and 1928 vintages were created , which have been considered by critics to be amongst the greatest champagnes . by the mid-1930s , paul krug ii , the son of joseph ii , was active in the business and would go on to become head of the house from 1959 to 1977 . his father only died in 1967 , by which time he was , according to patrick forbes , `` one of the most popular and respected figures in the champagne district '' . on april 12 , 2011 , legacy recordings released bob dylan in concert -- brandeis university 1963 , taped at brandeis university on may 10 , 1963 , two weeks prior to the release of the freewheelin ' bob dylan . the tape was discovered in the archive of music writer ralph j. gleason , and the recording carries liner notes by michael gray , who says it captures dylan `` from way back when kennedy -rsb- was president and the beatles had n't yet reached america . it reveals him not at any big moment but giving a performance like his folk club sets of the period ... this is the last live performance we have of bob dylan before he becomes a star .

in a 2019 interview , cooper said that he and his wife sheryl have a death pact , wherein they will die at the same time , sparking a flurry of headlines . but cooper clarified his comments telling usa today , `` what i was meaning was that because we 're almost always together , at home and on the road , that if something did happen to either of us , we 'd most likely be together at the time . but neither of us has a suicide pact . we have a life pact . '' throughout his career , cooper 's philosophy regarding politics is that politics should not be mixed with rock music . cooper has usually kept his political views to himself , and in 2010 said , `` i am extremely non-political . i go out of my way to be non-political . i 'm probably the biggest moderate you know . cooper 's father suffered a series of heart attacks while undergoing open-heart surgery , and died january 5 , 1978 , at the age of 50 . cooper considers his father 's book families to be `` sort of a guide on ... how he would have wanted me to live my life and the choices he would have wanted me to make . and so i feel very connected to him . ''
by the early 1960s , bush was widely regarded as an appealing political candidate , and some leading democrats attempted to convince bush to become a democrat . he declined to leave the republican party , later citing his belief that the national democratic party favored `` big , centralized government '' . the democratic party had historically dominated texas , but republicans scored their first major victory in the state with john g. tower 's victory in a 1961 special election to the united states senate . motivated by tower 's victory , and hoping to prevent the far-right john birch society from coming to power , bush ran for the chairmanship of the harris county , texas republican party , winning election in february 1963 . in the election the democrats won both houses of congress . the white house bulletin , published by bulletin news , cited rumors of rove 's impending departure from the white house staff : '' ` karl represents the old style and he 's got to go if the democrats are going to believe bush 's talk of getting along ' , said a key bush advisor . '' however , while allowing that many republican members of congress are `` resentful of the way he and the white house conducted the losing campaign '' , the new york times also stated that , `` white house officials say president bush has every intention of keeping mr. rove on through the rest of his term . '' bush defeated dukakis by a margin of 426 to 111 in the electoral college , and he took 53.4 percent of the national popular vote . bush ran well in all the major regions of the country , but especially in the south . he became the first sitting vice president to be elected president since martin van buren in 1836 , as well as the first person to succeed a president from his own party via election since herbert hoover in 1929 . in the concurrent congressional elections , democrats retained control of both houses of congress .
according to coca-cola 's chief marketing officer , sergio zyman , tab clear was an intentional `` kamikaze '' effort to create an unpopular beverage that was positioned as an analogue of crystal pepsi in order to `` kill both in the process '' . the `` born to die '' strategy included using the poor-performing tab brand rather than coke , labeling the product as a `` sugar free '' diet drink to confuse consumers into thinking crystal pepsi had no sugar , and marketing the product as if it were `` medicinal '' . zyman said `` pepsi spent an enormous amount of money on the brand and , regardless , we killed it . both of them were dead within six months .

the bush presidency transformed american politics , its economy , and its place in the world , but not in ways that could have been predicted when the governor of texas declared his candidacy for america 's highest office . as president , bush became a lightning rod for controversy . his controversial election and policies , especially the war in iraq , deeply divided the american people . arguably his greatest moment as president was his initial , heartfelt response to the tragedy of the 9/11 attacks . george walker bush -lrb- born july 6 , 1946 -rrb- is an american politician and businessman who served as the 43rd president of the united states from 2001 to 2009 . a member of the republican party , he had previously served as the 46th governor of texas from 1995 to 2000 . bush is frequently referred to as george w. bush , bush junior , or bush 43 to distinguish him from his father , george h. w. bush , who served as the 41st president of the united states from 1989 to 1993 . bush is the eldest son of barbara and george h. w. bush , and the second son to become the american president after his father , the first being john quincy adams . george herbert walker bush came into the presidency as one of the most qualified candidates to assume the office . he had a long career in both domestic politics and foreign affairs , knew the government bureaucracy , and had eight years of hands-on training as vice president . still , if presidential success is determined by winning reelection , bush was unsuccessful because he failed to convince the american public to give him another four years in office . generally the bush presidency is viewed as successful in foreign affairs but a disappointment in domestic affairs .

funding for the nih has often been a source of contention in congress , serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time . during the 1980s , president reagan repeatedly tried to cut funding for research , only to see congress partly restore funding . the political contention over nih funding slowed the nation 's response to the aids epidemic ; while aids was reported in newspaper articles from 1981 , no funding was provided for research on the disease . in 1984 national cancer institute scientists found implications that `` variants of a human cancer virus called htlv-iii are the primary cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome -lrb- aids -rrb- , '' a new epidemic that gripped the nation . take a movement break every 30 minutes , say experts . no matter how much you exercise , sitting for excessively long periods of time is a risk factor for early death , a new study published monday in annals of internal medicine found . there 's a direct relationship between time spent sitting and your risk of early mortality of any cause , researchers said , based on a study of nearly 8,000 adults . as your total sitting time increases , so does your risk of an early death . the national institutes of health was created on january 26 , 1996 by the up board of regents to enhance research undertakings of up manila with regards to public health . it serves as an institutional home of a network of researchers and research institutions . eventually , nih was established as the national health research center of the philippines through the health research and development act of 1998 , otherwise known as republic act 8503 .

ty systematically retired various designs , and many people assumed that all `` retired '' designs would rise in value the way that early retirees had . the craze lasted through 1999 and slowly declined after the ty company announced that they would no longer be making beanie babies and made a bear called `` the end '' . some time after the original announcement that the company would stop production , ty asked the public to vote on whether the product should continue ; fans and collectors voted `` overwhelmingly '' to keep the toys on the market . according to the oxford dictionary , the etymology is uncertain , but probably derives from the slang term `` bean '' , meaning `` head '' . in new zealand and australia , the term `` beanie '' is normally applied to a knit cap known as a tuque in canada and parts of the us , but also may apply to the kind of skull cap historically worn by surf lifesavers and still worn during surf sports . the non-knitted variety is normally called a `` cap '' in other countries . maple the bear was the first beanie baby bear that was made in honor of canada , and was sold exclusively in canada . introduced on january 1 , 1997 , maple was the first beanie baby to be exclusive to a country other than the united states . the original intention of ty was to name maple `` pride , '' but due to confusion involving `` pride of america '' , the name was changed , though not before the first 10,000 -lrb- originally thought to be 3000 -rrb- maples have tush tags with pride on the label .

president donald trump 's latest tirade against robert mueller 's investigation does not appear to have prompted many capitol hill republicans to reconsider the need for legislation to protect the special counsel . instead , gop lawmakers maintained tuesday that additional protections are n't necessary all but offered a sobering warning : any move by trump to oust mueller would be cataclysmic for his presidency . senate judiciary chairman chuck grassley told cnn , `` i think it would be suicide for the president to fire him . i think the less the president says about this whole thing , the better off he will be . mike pompeo , the trump administration 's nominee to lead the state department , told senators on the foreign relations committee on thursday he has cooperated with special counsel robert mueller 's russia investigation . `` i spoke with special counsel mueller , who interviewed me , requested an interview , i cooperated , '' he told the committee 's top democrat sen. bob menendez , who asked about the investigation , during his confirmation hearing . he also said president donald trump has never asked him do anything `` improper '' as it relates to the russia probe during then-fbi director james comey 's time as fbi director , but he declined to say if the president asked him to do anything about the comey probe and could not `` recall '' the nature of a march 2017 conversation where trump reportedly asked pompeo to get comey to pull back . `` i am not going to talk about private conversations i 've had with the president , '' he said . the longest-serving republican senator in history offered a sharp rebuke thursday to anyone recommending that president donald trump fire special counsel robert mueller . `` anyone advising the president -- in public or over the airwaves -- to fire bob mueller does not have the president or the nation 's best interest at heart . full stop , '' sen. orrin hatch , r-utah , tweeted . the utah republican 's remarks comes shortly after trump 's tweet early thursday morning that if he wanted to fire mueller , `` i would have fired him '' after it was reported he has discussed firing mueller for months .

president barack obama is set to deliver his seventh and final state of the union address on tuesday , where he is expected to outline his remaining goals as he finishes his second term . the president 's february 2009 speech was delivered before a joint session of congress , but is not considered an official state of the union address . in a teaser video released last week , obama expressed optimism for the year and said his speech would go beyond what he hopes to accomplish in his last months as president , but also on what he would like to see in the years to come . `` while i 'm writing , my team is cooking up new ways you can watch and engage with the speech , '' the president said . south carolina gov. nikki haley is a `` natural '' and will deliver a `` great '' response to the state of the union , house speaker paul ryan said monday . haley will respond to president barack obama 's speech for the republican party on tuesday , an honor bestowed on rising stars in the gop . the high-profile event has been both a launching pad for careers and an opportunity for embarrassment , depending on how the politician performs . he 's a lame duck president entering his final year in office . the race to replace him is in full swing , and when he gives his state of the union address , the first caucuses and primaries of 2016 will be right around the corner . but that does n't mean barack obama is going to leave the limelight quietly . the white house last month insisted obama would give his final state of the union address in a `` non-traditional '' way .
bowie married his first wife , mary angela barnett on 19 march 1970 at bromley register office in bromley , london . they had an open marriage . angela described their union as a marriage of convenience . `` we got married so that i could work . jonathan meets with david again and confirms his loyalty to david as the future king . after the people of ziph notify saul that david is taking refuge in their territory , saul seeks confirmation and plans to capture david in the wilderness of maon , but his attention is diverted by a renewed philistine invasion and david is able to secure some respite at ein gedi . returning from battle with the philistines , saul heads to ein gedi in pursuit of david and enters the cave where , as it happens , david and his supporters are hiding , `` to attend to his needs '' . david realises he has an opportunity to kill saul , but this is not his intention : he secretly cuts off a corner of saul 's robe , and when saul has left the cave he comes out to pay homage to saul as the king and to demonstrate , using the piece of robe , that he holds no malice towards saul . `` thirteen years ago , david letterman put cbs late night on the map and in the process became one of the defining icons of our network , '' said leslie moonves , president and ceo of cbs corporation . `` his presence on our air is an ongoing source of pride , and the creativity and imagination that the late show puts forth every night is an ongoing display of the highest quality entertainment . we are truly honored that one of the most revered and talented entertainers of our time will continue to call cbs ` home .

hillary clinton and bernie sanders are closing out their iowa caucus campaigns with notably different strategies . both candidates are blanketing the state in the closing days of the first-in-the-nation caucus -- that 's obvious . but that 's where the similarities end . the secret to the iowa caucuses is this : not all caucus sites are created equal . the democratic presidential hopefuls will face voters in a cnn town hall on monday in des moines -- one week before the highly anticipated iowa caucuses . former secretary of state hillary clinton , former maryland gov. martin o'malley and vermont sen. bernie sanders will field questions from iowa democrats in this prime-time event hosted by the iowa democratic party and drake university . `` we are honored to partner with cnn on their town hall with our three fantastic democratic candidates , '' said dr. andy mcguire , chair of the iowa democratic party . iowa is n't known as a bastion of diversity . but in the run up to the caucus on monday , hillary clinton is making a concerted effort to court some of the state 's racial and religious minorities . clinton made an unexpected visit to mt. zion missionary baptist church on sunday morning , tying herself to president barack obama 's legacy .
johnson has had four wives in five marriages , three of which were brief . his first two marriages were annulled within a matter of days . the names of johnson 's first two wives have not been made public , though they were said to have been a dancer and a `` rich bimbo '' . in the early 1970s , johnson lived with groupie pamela des barres . `` i 've loved court vision since he was a 2-year-old , '' said romans , who had taken over training the colt for only a few months before the mile . `` we saw him at the sales and have been following him . i 've been saying all week how good this horse was doing . when i saw how easy he was running down the backside , i thought if they just back up a little we 've got a hell of a shot .

the birth of a child . there 's nothing quite like it . especially when your baby is delivered in the middle of the night on the floorboard of your car while you 're speeding down california 's 580 freeway . that 's how january 24 , 1981 , began for donald lacy . in august 2014 , barrymore stated that he would be presenting a new show called stealing the limelight which would be similar to my kind of people where he and a co-presenter called barrie drewitt-barlow would travel the country and allow members of the public to audition for the chance to appear on the show . dates were booked in liverpool , manchester and london . however , this came to nothing and the twitter page for the new show now no longer exists . julian assange has been sentenced to just under a year in a uk prison on wednesday after he was found guilty of violating his bail conditions when he entered ecuador 's london embassy to avoid extradition to sweden in 2012 . `` you had a choice and the course of action you chose was to commit an offense , '' judge deborah taylor said . `` you have not surrendered willingly . had the government of ecuador not permitted entry to the embassy , you would not have voluntarily come before the court , '' she added , before handing down an `` imprisonment of 50 weeks .

the theorem has been given numerous proofs -- possibly the most for any mathematical theorem . they are very diverse , including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs , with some dating back thousands of years . the theorem can be generalized in various ways , including higher-dimensional spaces , to spaces that are not euclidean , to objects that are not right triangles , and indeed , to objects that are not triangles at all , but n-dimensional solids . the pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical abstruseness , mystique , or intellectual power ; popular references in literature , plays , musicals , songs , stamps and cartoons abound . dominic cheung , a poet and professor of east asian languages at the university of southern california , said that had it not been for the chinese civil war , chang would have been a recipient of the nobel prize in literature . in mathematics , the pythagorean theorem , also known as pythagoras ' theorem , is a fundamental relation in euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle . it states that the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse -lrb- the side opposite the right angle -rrb- is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides . this theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a , b and c , often called the `` pythagorean equation '' :
cnn was the first cable news channel to break the news of the september 11 attacks . anchor carol lin was on the air to deliver the first public report of the event . she broke into a commercial at 8:49 a.m. eastern time that morning and said : bolduan was previously co-anchor of the situation room with wolf blitzer before moving to new york . alongside wolf blitzer , she provided current events , breaking news , political headlines , and reports within lively discussions during the two-hour program . daryn kagan and leon harris were live on the air just after 9:00 a.m. eastern time as the second plane hit the north tower of the world trade center and through an interview with cnn correspondent david ensor , reported the news that u.s. officials determined `` that this is a terrorist act . '' later , aaron brown and judy woodruff anchored through the day and night as the attacks unfolded , winning an edward r. murrow award for the network . brown had just joined cnn from abc to serve as the breaking news anchor . cnn has made archival files of much of the day 's broadcast available in five segments , plus an overview .
while the rt at first seemed to have the upper hand , with landy elected national secretary in 1972 , by the next year landy and his faction had been expelled . at the time of the split , the rsl took 100 of the is 's 300 members . the expelled group , now styling itself the revolutionary socialist league , adopted generally orthodox trotskyist positions based on the transitional program including permanent revolution , opposition to popular fronts and the need for a fourth international . this last position cost them unity with the class struggle league , who advocated a fifth international . the rise of fascism in nazi germany and the failure of the communist and social democratic left to unite against the common danger created a situation where certain radical parties throughout the world reexamined their priorities and sought a mechanism for building united action . as early as december 1933 , a trotskyist splinter group called the communist league of struggle -lrb- cls -rrb- , headed by former socialist party youth section leader albert weisbord and his wife vera buch , approached norman thomas of the socialist party of america seeking a united front hunger march of the two organizations followed by a general strike . this suggestion was dismissed as `` poppycock '' by sp executive secretary clarence senior , but the seed of the idea of joint action had been planted . the rsl was one of the left groups most active in the pre-aids gay movement . rick miles considered this area `` particularly important '' because he believed that much of the left suffered from the same homophobia as the rest of society , and because the `` gay question '' had a direct bearing on their concept of socialism as a `` free society '' run directly by workers and oppressed people , rather than an authoritarian society run by a state capitalist class . it also emphasized the oppressive nature of the stalinist countries where homosexuals were repressed . the rsl recruited a minority tendency of the red flag union , a gay socialist collective , to its state capitalist characterization , and they merged into the league in 1977 .
justin boyles lay in bed , exhausted and depressed . his 385-pound body sank into the mattress with each breath he took . i have diabetes , he thought in disbelief . his 6-year-old daughter , autumn , crawled on top of the king-sized comforter and stared at him with bright blue eyes . after his father 's retirement in june 1984 , his mother remained at her new edinburgh home while the rest of the family moved into his father 's home at 1418 pine avenue , montreal known as cormier house where the following autumn he began attending the private collège jean-de-brébeuf , his father 's alma mater . the school had begun as a jesuit school but was non-denominational by the time justin matriculated . in 2008 , trudeau said that of all his early family outings he enjoyed camping with his father the most , because `` that was where our father got to be just our father -- a dad in the woods '' . during the summers his father would send him and his brothers to camp ahmek , on canoe lake , in algonquin provincial park , where he would later work in his first paid employment as a camp counselor . in an interview in august 2013 , trudeau said that the last time he had used marijuana was in 2010 , after he had become a member of parliament : `` we had a few good friends over for a dinner party , our kids were at their grandmother 's for the night , and one of our friends lit a joint and passed it around . i had a puff . '' after analysing the results of the legalization of marijuana in colorado , trudeau reiterated his position in favour of the legalization in canada , saying that canadians would benefit from analysing the experiences of both colorado and the state of washington .
robert hooke was born in 1635 in freshwater on the isle of wight to john hooke and cecily gyles . robert was the last of four children , two boys and two girls , and there was an age difference of seven years between him and the next youngest . their father john was a church of england priest , the curate of freshwater 's church of all saints , and his two brothers -lrb- robert 's uncles -rrb- were also ministers . robert hooke was expected to succeed in his education and join the church . simon , patricia and doyle cosentino make their way back to an apartment in los angeles to think up the next stage of their plan now that valecross is out of the picture , and while there , it is revealed that simon originally met patricia in iraq when escaping from the russian heist . they head to the valecross home in order to search for the `` nomad '' that valecross mentioned just before he died . when they get there , mrs valecross immediately recognizes templar and they decide to call rayt marius , who , it is revealed , has a history with patricia . burns 's worldly prospects were perhaps better than they had ever been ; but he had become soured , and had alienated many of his friends by freely expressing sympathy with the french and american revolutions and the advocates of reform and votes for all men . his political views came to the notice of his employers and in an attempt to prove his loyalty to the crown , burns joined the royal dumfries volunteers in march 1795 . as his health began to give way , he began to age prematurely and fell into fits of despondency . the habits of intemperance -lrb- alleged mainly by temperance activist james currie -rrb- are said to have aggravated his long-standing possible rheumatic heart condition .
in late april 2017 , trump hired julie radford as her chief of staff . before the end of the month , trump and radford had plans to travel with dina powell and hope hicks to the first w20 women 's summit . the w20 was organized by the national council of german women 's organizations and the association of german women entrepreneurs as one of the preparatory meetings leading up to the g20 head-of-state summit in july . at the conference , trump spoke about women 's rights . it was announced by donald trump in august 2017 that his daughter would lead the u.s. delegation to india in the fall in a global support of women 's entrepreneurship . in response to the announcement , an indian diplomat was quoted as stating , `` we regard ivanka trump the way we do half-wit saudi princes . it 's in our national interest to flatter them . '' the majority of reactions to her actual performance alongside p.m. modi at the event were substantial . after she was appointed advisor to the president , trump donated the unpaid half of the advance payments for her book women who work : rewriting the rules for success to the national urban league and the boys and girls clubs of america . she further said that any royalties exceeding the advances would also be given to charity .
hillary clinton flew to california on friday for a series of weekend fundraisers , including two events hosted by george and amal clooney . supporters of bernie sanders were ready . when clinton 's motorcade turned up washington street in san francisco 's posh nob hill area friday night , protesters chanting at the 2016 candidate were standing atop the hill . `` release the transcripts , '' they shouted , referring to clinton 's paid speeches . the new york times reported that `` the long day of often-testy exchanges between committee members and their prominent witness revealed little new information about an episode that has been the subject of seven previous investigations ... perhaps stung by recent admissions that the pursuit of mrs. clinton 's emails was politically motivated , republican lawmakers on the panel for the most part avoided any mention of her use of a private email server . '' the email issue did arise shortly before lunch , in `` a shouting match '' between republican committee chair trey gowdy and two democrats , adam schiff and elijah cummings . late in the hearing , republican representative jim jordan of ohio accused clinton of changing her accounts of the email service , leading to a `` heated exchange '' in which clinton said that she had erred in making a private email account , but denied having dealt with anything marked classified , instead seeking `` to be transparent by publicly releasing her emails . '' clinton was u.s. secretary of state in the obama administration from 2009 to 2013 . during her tenure , clinton responded to the arab spring by advocating military intervention in libya . she was harshly criticized by republicans for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the 2012 benghazi attack . clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international sanctions against iran in an effort to force it to curtail its nuclear program ; this effort eventually led to the multinational joint comprehensive plan of action agreement in 2015 .

'' he released his debut single , titled `` ghostboy '' featuring claire ridgely , on majestic casual records . the song received international acclaim on major streaming platforms and peaked at 5th on the viral charts of united states , united kingdom , and germany . on 7 june 2002 , about a year after the raid , philippine army troops conducted a rescue operation in which martin burnham and filipino nurse ediborah yap were killed . the remaining hostage was wounded and the hostage takers escaped . in july 2004 , gracia burnham testified at a trial of eight abu sayyaf members and identified six of the suspects as her captors , including alhamzer limbong , abdul azan diamla , abu khari moctar , bas ishmael , alzen jandul , and dazid baize . `` the eight suspects sat silently during her three-hour testimony , separated from her by a wooden grill .
in the late 2000s , fox launched a few series that proved to be powerful hits in different respects . in 2007 , the network began production on the game shows are you smarter than a 5th grader ? and do n't forget the lyrics ; both shows ran for a total of three seasons each , making them the longest-running game shows in fox 's history . in 2008 , the supernatural mystery series fringe debuted to moderate ratings but earned critical acclaim during its first season on tuesdays . fox 's overexposure in the media led several men 's websites , such as askmen , to boycott her on august 4 , 2009 , although some refused to do so , feeling that the boycott was a publicity stunt and therefore hypocritical . in response to the media attention , fox told magazine nylon , in september of that year , that '' wanted to make sure would make $ 700 million , so they oversaturated the media with their stars '' and that she did not `` want to have people get completely sick of before ever even done something legitimate . '' she became much less prominent in the media by 2010 , after starring in the less commercially successful films jonah hex and passion play . that same year , fox said , `` my biggest regret is that i 've assisted the media in making me into a cartoon character . in august 2018 , fox television group ceo dana walden outlined how the network would operate following the transition to new fox . the network will commission and acquire series from `` independent '' studios -lrb- such as lionsgate , mgm television , sony pictures television , and warner bros. , the last of which being a co-owner of the cw with cbs but not outright owning a major broadcast network -rrb- . walden noted that the vertical integration of the major broadcast networks -lrb- including fox itself -rrb- with associated studios had limited opportunities for outside studios , and cited several top programs that were distributed by third-parties , such as the big bang theory and this is us -lrb- produced by warner bros. . television and 20th television for cbs and nbc respectively -rrb- . there are also plans for fox to acquire new pitches directly from their writers , and offer them to outside producers .
after the premiere , a journalist mentioned to tarantino that robbie had few lines . tarantino responded : `` i reject your hypothesis '' . robbie elaborated , `` i think the moments on screen show those wonderful sides of could be adequately done without speaking . '' tarantino stated : `` i thought it would both be touching and pleasurable and also sad and melancholy to just spend a little time with , just existing ... tarantino first created cliff booth , giving him a massive backstory . then , the actor booth was the stunt double for rick dalton . tarantino decided to have them be sharon tate 's next door neighbors in 1969 . the first plot point he developed was the ending , then moved backwards from there , this being the first time tarantino had worked this way . the work that would become the screenplay for once upon a time in hollywood was developed slowly over several years by tarantino . while he knew he wanted the work to be titled once upon a time in hollywood , evoking the idea of a fairy tale set in 1960s hollywood , he publicly referred to the project as magnum opus . the life of the work for the first five years was as a novel , which tarantino considered to be an exploratory approach to the story he wanted to tell , not yet having decided if it would be a screenplay . tarantino tried other writing approaches : the early scene between dicaprio 's dalton and pacino 's marvin schwarz was originally written as a one-act play as part of this exploratory work .
rutgers was among the first american institutions to engage in intercollegiate athletics , and participated in a small circle of schools that included yale university , columbia university and long-time rival , princeton university -lrb- then called the college of new jersey -rrb- . the four schools met at the fifth avenue hotel in manhattan on october 19 , 1873 , to establish a set of rules governing their intercollegiate competition , and particularly to codify the new game of football . although invited , harvard chose not to attend . in the early years of intercollegiate athletics , the schools that participated in these athletic events were located solely in the american northeast . rutgers university -- new brunswick is one of three regional campuses of rutgers university , new jersey 's public research university . it is located in new brunswick and piscataway . it is the oldest campus of the university , the others being in camden and newark . the campus is composed of several smaller campuses : college avenue , busch , livingston , cook , and douglass , the latter two sometimes referred to as `` cook/douglass , '' as they are adjacent to each other . there were setbacks in the growth of the university . in 1967 , the rutgers physics department had a centers of excellence grant from the nsf which allowed the physics department to hire several faculty each year . these faculty were to be paid by the grant for three years , but after that time any faculty hired with the associate or full professor designation would become tenured . the governor and the chancellor forced rutgers to lose this grant by rejecting the condition that tenure be granted .

realism is one of the dominant schools of thought in international relations theory , theoretically formalising the realpolitik statesmanship of early modern europe . although a highly diverse body of thought , it is unified by the belief that world politics is always and necessarily a field of conflict among actors pursuing power . the theories of realism are contrasted by the cooperative ideals of liberalism . realists can be divided into three classes based on their view of the essential causes of interstate conflict . the prince -lrb- italian : il principe , latin : de principatibus -rrb- is a 16th-century political treatise by the italian diplomat and political theorist niccolò machiavelli . from his correspondence , a version appears to have been distributed in 1513 , using a latin title , de principatibus -lrb- of principalities -rrb- . however , the printed version was not published until 1532 , five years after machiavelli 's death . this was carried out with the permission of the medici pope clement vii , but `` long before then , in fact since the first appearance of the prince in manuscript , controversy had swirled about his writings '' . although the prince was written as if it were a traditional work in the mirrors for princes style , it is generally agreed that it was especially innovative . machiavellianism as a trope , or `` popular discourse '' , in political history is a pejorative term for the supposed political philosophy of the italian renaissance diplomat niccolò machiavelli , `` a negative caricature of machiavellian ideology as godless , scheming and self-interested '' . though in discussions of machiavelli 's thought `` machiavellian '' and `` machiavellianism '' may be used in reasoned critiques , in general usage the terms more often occur in political polemic , suggesting an unprincipled lust for power , achieved through `` subtle policie , cunning roguerie '' -lrb- the earliest dictionary definition in english , from 1611 -rrb- , by the `` machiavel '' , an adherant of these principles . in this trope , as described by isaiah berlin , machiavelli was regarded as `` a man inspired by the devil to lead good men to their doom , the great subverter , the teacher of evil , le docteur de la scélératesse , the inspirer of st. bartholomew 's eve , the original of iago '' . in particular english theatre saw a '' ` pseudo-machiavellian ' burlesque stage tradition . its relation to machiavelli 's political doctrine does not go much beyond its borrowing of the florentine 's name .

by the early 1960s , bush was widely regarded as an appealing political candidate , and some leading democrats attempted to convince bush to become a democrat . he declined to leave the republican party , later citing his belief that the national democratic party favored `` big , centralized government '' . the democratic party had historically dominated texas , but republicans scored their first major victory in the state with john g. tower 's victory in a 1961 special election to the united states senate . motivated by tower 's victory , and hoping to prevent the far-right john birch society from coming to power , bush ran for the chairmanship of the harris county , texas republican party , winning election in february 1963 . in his general election campaign , kerry promised to mix liberalism with tight budget controls . he defeated republican ray shamie despite a nationwide landslide for the re-election of republican president ronald reagan , for whom massachusetts voted by a narrow margin . in his victory speech , kerry asserted that his win meant that the people of massachusetts `` emphatically reject the politics of selfishness and the notion that women must be treated as second-class citizens .

'' in 2000 , bowie was voted by other music stars as the `` most influential artist of all time '' in a poll by nme . alexis petridis of the guardian wrote that bowie was confirmed by 1980 to be `` the most important and influential artist since the beatles '' . dressed in a striking costume , his hair dyed reddish-brown , bowie launched his ziggy stardust stage show with the spiders from mars -- ronson , bolder , and woodmansey -- at the toby jug pub in tolworth in kingston upon thames on 10 february 1972 . the show was hugely popular , catapulting him to stardom as he toured the uk over the next six months and creating , as described by buckley , a `` cult of bowie '' that was `` unique -- its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom . '' the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars -lrb- 1972 -rrb- , combining the hard rock elements of the man who sold the world with the lighter experimental rock and pop of hunky dory , was released in june . `` starman '' , issued as an april single ahead of the album , was to cement bowie 's uk breakthrough : both single and album charted rapidly following his july top of the pops performance of the song . `` changes '' is a song by english singer-songwriter david bowie , originally released on the album hunky dory in december 1971 and as a single on 7 january 1972 , the day before bowie 's 25th birthday . despite missing the top 40 of the billboard hot 100 , `` changes '' became one of bowie 's best-known songs . the lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality , the frequent change of the world today , and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s . this single has been cited as david bowie 's official north american debut , despite the fact that the song `` the man who sold the world '' was released in north america two years prior .

troy university in montgomery , alabama wanted to dedicate their new library and museum to rosa parks , `` the mother of the civil rights movement '' . the library carries her name and it commemorates her refusal to give up her seat on the montgomery city bus to a white man . the museum and library were opened on the anniversary of the day she refused to give up her seat : december 1 . city officials in montgomery and detroit announced on october 27 , 2005 , that the front seats of their city buses would be reserved with black ribbons in honor of parks until her funeral . parks ' coffin was flown to montgomery and taken in a horse-drawn hearse to the st. paul african methodist episcopal -lrb- ame -rrb- church , where she lay in repose at the altar on october 29 , 2005 , dressed in the uniform of a church deaconess . a memorial service was held there the following morning . one of the speakers , united states secretary of state condoleezza rice , said that if it had not been for parks , she would probably have never become the secretary of state . rosa louise mccauley parks -lrb- february 4 , 1913 -- october 24 , 2005 -rrb- was an american activist in the civil rights movement best known for her pivotal role in the montgomery bus boycott . the united states congress has called her `` the first lady of civil rights '' and `` the mother of the freedom movement '' . on december 1 , 1955 , in montgomery , alabama , parks rejected bus driver james f. blake 's order to relinquish her seat in the `` colored section '' to a white passenger , after the whites-only section was filled . parks was not the first person to resist bus segregation , but the national association for the advancement of colored people -lrb- naacp -rrb- believed that she was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her arrest for civil disobedience in violating alabama segregation laws . parks ' prominence in the community and her willingness to become a controversial figure inspired the black community to boycott the montgomery buses for over a year , the first major direct action campaign of the post-war civil rights movement .
the 1990s led off with grand met taking burger king 's soft drink contract to coca-cola from pepsi . traditionally burger king had sold soft drinks from the coca-cola company in the united states , but in 1983 , pepsico was able to garner the us$ 444 million beverage supplier contract from its rival . despite extreme market debate over the future of the contract , it was renewed for a second term in 1987 . a sweetened contract that strengthened marketing and advertising program ties between burger king and itself allowed pepsi to keep supplying soft drinks to bk . when the predecessor of international fast food restaurant chain burger king -lrb- bk -rrb- first opened in 1953 , its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers , french fries , soft drinks , milkshakes , and desserts . after being acquired by its miami , florida franchisees and renamed in 1954 , bk began expanding its menu by adding the whopper . the company did not add another permanent hamburger to its menu until the introduction of the big king sandwich in 1996 in response to mcdonald 's big mac sandwich . the company began experimenting with premium hamburgers , made from higher quality ingredients , in 1978 with the introduction of its specialty sandwich product line . with the opening of its whopper bar locations in the united states during 2010 , burger king reported that it would be the first time in its north american locations that beer would be available for purchase . although beer is available at fast food restaurants throughout europe , including burger king , this is the first time a major fast food chain has attempted to sell beer in the united states . the company will be selling products from sabmiller and anheuser-busch including budweiser , bud lite and miller lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature . the move , designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic , has been called risky by industry analysts because of the company is known as a fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller .

president bush 's legacy continues to develop today . supporters credit bush 's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring in the u.s. after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the medicare prescription drug benefit and the aids relief program known as pepfar . critics often point to his handling of the iraq war , specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction , that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion -- as well as his handling of tax policy , hurricane katrina , climate change and the 2008 financial crisis -- as proof that george w. bush was unfit to be president . in response to the september 11 terrorist attacks , bush launched a `` war on terror '' that began with the war in afghanistan in 2001 and later expanded to the iraq war in 2003 . signature legislation passed during his presidency included broad tax cuts , the patriot act , the no child left behind act , the partial-birth abortion ban act , the medicare modernization act , and funding for the aids relief program known as pepfar . in the 2004 presidential race , bush defeated democratic senator john kerry in a close election . after his re-election , bush received criticism from across the political spectrum for his handling of the iraq war , hurricane katrina , and other challenges . the bush presidency transformed american politics , its economy , and its place in the world , but not in ways that could have been predicted when the governor of texas declared his candidacy for america 's highest office . as president , bush became a lightning rod for controversy . his controversial election and policies , especially the war in iraq , deeply divided the american people . arguably his greatest moment as president was his initial , heartfelt response to the tragedy of the 9/11 attacks .

on march 11 , 2012 , after months of attempting to change the attitude of the ministry 's board , coleman told the crystal cathedral congregation that she was leaving to start a new church because of `` a hostile work environment '' . the international business times reported that this came following `` a bitter fallout between the ministry and its founding family '' . according to the religion news service , the founders were left with little to no assets ; their home was fully mortgaged . on 8 june 2011 , it was reported daughter meyers had filed an application with the court to make bettencourt a ward of the state for her health and being incapable of the management of her fortune . on 17 october 2011 , a french judge ruled that she was to be placed under the guardianship of members of her family on concerns about bettencourt 's declining mental health . francoise bettencourt-meyers , along with bettencourt 's two grandsons , gained control of her wealth and property . one of the grandsons was additionally named as her personal guardian . further controversy arose when it was revealed that l'oréal had its german headquarters for over 30 years , before being sold in 1991 , on land confiscated from a jewish family during world war ii . the jewish family has been battling for restitution from the company for three generations , the latest of which is edith rosenfelder , a holocaust survivor . fritz rosenfelder , was forced to sell the house to a nazi official , of which the family never received the proceeds of the sale . instead , the family was deported .
economics professor alan zagier blames credential inflation for the admission of so many unqualified students into college . he reports that the number of new jobs requiring college degrees is less than the number of college graduates . he states that the more money that a state spends on higher education , the slower the economy grows , the opposite of long held notions . other studies have shown that the level of cognitive achievement attained by students in a country -lrb- as measured by academic testing -rrb- is closely correlated with the country 's economic growth , but that `` increasing the average number of years of schooling attained by the labor force boosts the economy only when increased levels of school attainment also boost cognitive skills . however , according to a 2004 survey , a majority of the 1001 parent groups polled wants complete sex education in the schools . the american people are heavily divided over the issue . over 80 % of polled parents agreed with the statement `` sex education in school makes it easier for me to talk to my child about sexual issues , '' while under 17 % agreed with the statement that their children were being exposed to `` subjects i do n't think my child should be discussing . '' 10 percent believed that their children 's sexual education class forced them to discuss sexual issues `` too early . '' teachers have been frustrated with lack of parent involvement in the learning process , particularly in the earlier grades . children spend about 26 % of their time in school , sleep 40 % , leaving about 34 % of their time left-over . teachers believe that parents are not supervising their children 's free time to encourage the learning process , such as basic literacy , which is crucial not only to later success in life , but also to keeping them out of prison .
the term was coined by marketing strategist jerry welsh , while he was working as the manager of global marketing efforts for american express in the 1980s . most ambush marketing campaigns aim to associate a brand with the prominence of a major event , without actually being an `` official '' partner or sponsor of said event . an advertiser may indirectly ambush an event by alluding to its imagery and themes without referencing any specific trademarks associated with it , or in `` direct '' and `` predatory '' means -- where an advertiser engages in the fraudulent use of official names and trademarks to deliberately mislead consumers . payne and the united states olympic committee 's marketing director john krimsky held a meeting over the campaign with howard slusher , a subordinate of nike co-founder phil knight . the meeting quickly turned aggressive ; payne threatened ioc counter-measures , including pulling accreditation for nike employees , banning the display of its logos on equipment , and organizing a press conference where silver medallists from the games , as well as prominent nike-sponsored athlete michael johnson , would denounce the company . faced with these threats , nike agreed to retract most of its negative advertising and pr stunts . after reebok unexpectedly pulled out on short notice , nike eventually served as the official sportswear supplier of the 2000 summer olympics in sydney , australia -- using them to launch the company 's first-ever global marketing campaign . it was sued by egypt , rwanda , and sri lanka for allegedly operating a product-based pyramid scheme . the company and its franchise vihaan are under investigation in india . the bombay high court denied the anticipatory bail plea of the directors of vihaan direct selling pvt ltd. , a franchise of qnet , which included world amateur billiards champion michael ferreira after it was earlier rejected by sessions court . they were facing charges of cheating and forgery the court observed that `` the deceit and fraud is camouflaged under the name of e-marketing and business '' .

in 2016 , eastman kodak showed a concept for a new super 8 camera , its first such camera in over 30 years . although kodak has neither confirmed nor denied it , logmar is said to have assisted in the design of the transport and the camera 's firmware . a working prototype was displayed at the 2017 consumer electronics show , with kodak hoping to begin production in spring 2017 . super 8 has its roots in a marketing association for individually owned hotels that were already in business started by dennis brown in 1972 . after one year , in 1973 ron rivett and dennis brown canceled the association and created their new super 8 motel corporation with each of them owning 50 % of the stock in the new company . the original room rate was us$ 8.88 , hence the numeric brand name . the first super 8 , with 60 rooms , opened in aberdeen , south dakota in 1974 , built near a holiday inn with just some drawings made by rivett as blueprints . becker and greene had specialized in building low-cost housing developments , and they wanted to provide an alternative to other major hotel chains , such as holiday inn , whose locations were becoming increasingly upscale in quality and price in the 1960s , after starting out with a budget-oriented concept . becker and greene spent two years formulating their business model and searched for ways to cut costs as much as possible . during the chain 's early years , motel 6 emphasized itself as a `` no-frills '' lodging chain with rooms featuring coin-operated black-and-white television receivers instead of the free color televisions found in the more expensive motels , along with functional interior decor , to reduce the time it took to clean the rooms . the first location in santa barbara had no restaurant on-site , a notable difference from other hotels of the era .
michael jordan , to whom bryant was often compared , said in a statement : `` words ca n't describe the pain i am feeling . i loved kobe -- he was like a little brother to me ... we used to talk often , and i will miss those conversations very much . he was a fierce competitor , one of the greats of the game and a creative force . '' shaquille o'neal , bryant 's lakers teammate from 1996 to 2004 and with whom he shared a friendship and later a heavily publicized feud , said that he was `` sick '' and `` had no words to express the pain . '' in april 2019 , he pretended to cross the mexico -- united states border to show how easy it was for immigrants to enter into the country ; this came to light after it was pointed out by his democratic challenger , ammar campa-najjar , that actually leaving the country would violate his parole after his indictment on illegal spending of campaign funds . in the video hunter says he is at `` the grand border wall in yuma , arizona , '' while standing next to a waist-high barrier near the border . hunter indicated that the small barrier was in fact the border wall and elaborated that `` this is what we expect to stop people , transnational terrorists , families , all illegal aliens from coming across the border . this is it . '' hunter was an early supporter of donald trump 's presidential bid , endorsing him in february 2016 in the earliest days of the republican primary . he was the second member of congress to support him . according to anonymous sources , during an address to riverside county young republicans in late august 2017 , hunter said of president trump , `` he 's just like he is on tv ... he 's an asshole , but he 's our asshole .

in july , miller went to washington to brief the sdi office -lrb- sdio -rrb- on their progress . while the instrumentation concerns had been publicly reported on multiple occasions by this point , he failed to mention these issues . several sources noted this , and one stated they `` were furious because miller used the old view graphs on the experiment , which did not take into account the new disturbing findings . '' gerwig 's direction was deemed notable for several reasons . kate erbland of indiewire commended gerwig for how she `` modernized the book 's timeless story in unexpected ways '' , while also maintaining an `` affection for the original , and keenly aware of how the concerns of alcott and the march sisters -lrb- loosely based on the author 's own family -rrb- have never quite abated , no matter the time . '' she was also lauded for her screenplay , with brian truitt of usa today dubbing her writing `` a fantastic follow-up to her oscar-nominated lady bird that makes alcott 's time and language feel effervescently modern and authentically nostalgic . '' once they leave the hotel and resume their trip , they run into a hitchhiker , chrishelle , and when dorothy shakes her head at nate , he quotes to her `` what would jesus do '' to justify him stopping for the attractive young woman . when chrishelle gets into the truck , she steals cereal from destiny , and drops a reefer pipe in the back seat . the family stops at bun world for lunch , and destiny 's birthday celebration , and when nate asks chrishelle to bless the food , she begins to roll her eyes and hiss strange phrases , which frightens the family and they all refuse to sit near her once they get back in the car . that evening , they all go to a hotel to rest , and nate is woken up by a small alligator in his and dorothy 's bed .
on april 30 , 2018 , the new york times published a list of interview questions for trump that the mueller investigation had provided to the president 's attorneys . the list was provided to the times by an individual outside trump 's legal team . among the questions was , `` what knowledge did you have of any outreach by your campaign , including by paul manafort , to russia about potential assistance to the campaign ? '' before this disclosure , there had been no publicly available information indicating any such outreach . on may 29 , 2019 , mueller announced that he was retiring as special counsel and that the office would be shut down , and he spoke publicly about the report for the first time . saying `` he report is my testimony , '' he indicated he would have nothing to say that was n't already in the report . on the subject of obstruction of justice , he said he had been prohibited by justice department policy from charging the president with a crime and that any potential wrongdoing by a president must be addressed by a `` process other than the criminal justice system '' . this suggested that the investigation could now be picked up by congress . the new york times reported on march 7 , 2018 , that the mueller investigation is aware of conversations trump had with two witnesses regarding their testimony with investigators . in one conversation , trump asked white house counsel don mcgahn to issue a statement denying a story the times published in january 2018 . that story reported that mcgahn told investigators trump had ordered him to direct the justice department to dismiss mueller . mcgahn never issued the statement and reportedly told trump that the president had , in fact , told him to have mueller dismissed .
new drugs receive extensive scrutiny before fda approval in a process called a new drug application -lrb- nda -rrb- . critics , however , argue that the fda standards are not sufficiently rigorous , allowing unsafe or ineffective drugs to be approved . new drugs are available only by prescription by default . a change to over-the-counter -lrb- otc -rrb- status is a separate process , and the drug must be approved through an nda first . critics of the fda 's regulatory power argue that the fda takes too long to approve drugs that might ease pain and human suffering faster if brought to market sooner . the aids crisis created some political efforts to streamline the approval process . however , these limited reforms were targeted for aids drugs , not for the broader market . this has led to the call for more robust and enduring reforms that would allow patients , under the care of their doctors , access to drugs that have passed the first round of clinical trials . 23andme only sold raw genetic data and ancestry-related results in the us due to fda restrictions from november 22 , 2013 until october 21 , 2015 , when it announced that it would resume providing health information in the form of carrier status and wellness reports with fda approval . wojcicki said they still plan to report on disease risk , subject to future fda approval .
president donald trump did not record his conversations with fired fbi director james comey , he tweeted on thursday , ending weeks of speculation kick-started by the president himself . `` with all of the recently reported electronic surveillance , intercepts , unmasking and illegal leaking of information , i have no idea whether there are ` tapes ' or recordings of my conversations with james comey , but i did not make , and do not have , any such recordings , '' trump tweeted . the statement ended speculation about whether the president recorded conversations in the oval office . comey , who trump fired last month , said he had hoped there were recordings of their conversations . donald trump has n't had a lot of good weeks since being sworn in as the 45th president of the united states . but this was his worst one yet . this was the week the investigation of russia 's involvement in the 2016 election reached the oval office -- and trump himself . the washington post reported wednesday night that trump himself is under investigation by special counsel bob mueller for the possibility that he obstructed justice in his decision to fire former fbi director james comey . president donald trump finally , grudgingly , had no choice but to come clean . his admission , on twitter thursday that he did not secretly record his conversations with fired fbi director james comey -- after earlier raising the possibility that he did -- capped a six-week charade that damaged his presidency and cast doubt on his personal credibility . it was a surreal new twist to a presidency that has often already stretched the limits of credulity , and has challenged conventions on the decorum and gravity expected in the behavior of the person who holds the office itself . after weeks of speculation , the president delivered a mea culpa , a step that he had little choice to make , in a somewhat resentful manner , in keeping with his reluctance to ever publicly admit error .

'' he acted in the 2002 psychological thriller changing lanes . the scenes in which he appeared were edited out of the final cut of the film , but are featured on the film 's dvd and blu-ray releases . there 's a reason `` a star is born '' was made -lrb- and remade and remade -rrb- , meaning a new version need n't reinvent the wheel . director-star-co-writer bradley cooper is shrewd enough not to try , crafting a pleasantly satisfying movie and splashy big-screen showcase for lady gaga , in a role that capitalizes on her musical talents as few others could . although gaga made a tv foray into the bloody confines of the `` american horror story '' franchise , there 's far more dimension -- not to mention singing -- in this update of the familiar showbiz cautionary tale , about a star who discovers and woos a fresh new talent , only to see her light ascending even as his fades . here , cooper is jackson maine , a pill-popping , boozing rock star who -- in pursuit of his next drink -- stumbles into a bar where he meets gaga 's ally , who 's moonlighting as a singer .
the president and the vice president are elected together in a presidential election . it is an indirect election , with the winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the electoral college . in modern times , voters in each state select a slate of electors from a list of several slates designated by different parties or candidates , and the electors typically promise in advance to vote for the candidates of their party -lrb- whose names of the presidential candidates usually appear on the ballot rather than those of the individual electors -rrb- . the winner of the election is the candidate with at least 270 electoral college votes . ballot access refers to the laws which regulate under what conditions access is granted for a candidate or political party to appear on voters ' ballots . each state has its own ballot access laws to determine who may appear on ballots and who may not . according to article i , section 4 , of the united states constitution , the authority to regulate the time , place , and manner of federal elections is up to each state , unless congress legislates otherwise . depending on the office and the state , it may be possible for a voter to cast a write-in vote for a candidate whose name does not appear on the ballot , but it is extremely rare for such a candidate to win office . as a matter of convenience and cost saving , elections for many of these state and local offices are held at the same time as either the federal presidential or midterm elections . there are a handful of states , however , that instead hold their elections during odd-numbered `` off years .

after the memo was leaked in june 2018 , a representative for turning point criticized young america 's foundation in a statement to the chronicle of higher education , accusing the group of `` abandoning the ` reagan rule ' '' that `` thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow republican . '' although charlie kirk did not directly respond to the memo , he posted on twitter that he wished `` some conservatives fought the left as hard as they fight people who support president trump '' . turning point 's communications director candace owens directly responded to the memo , saying she was `` truly speechless '' over the memo supposedly attacking kirk for his lack of college experience . a former employee stated on twitter that `` tpusa activists do some incredible work . after tpusa 's annual `` student action summit '' in late december 2018 , dissidents within the organization , headed by conservative activist kevin martin , formed `` heal our voice '' , a group critical of kirk 's leadership of turning point usa . one member of the group told the daily beast that `` charlie kirk can be a little bit of a snowflake -- or a lot a bit of a snowflake . '' other complaints concerned sexual harassment and assault at tpusa events . a private brochure , handed out only to turning point donors , highlighted the organization 's alleged strategy to take over student governments at universities across the country , and included a list of every turning point-supported student who was elected to student government positions in the year 2017 . turning point said that it had helped more than 50 conservatives win elections to become student-body presidents . however , when politico looked into turning point 's claims , it found the `` success rate to be considerably overstated . in fact , some of the students that turning point usa claimed to have backed flatly condemned the organization and said they 'd never spoken to anyone who works for it .

from june 28 , 2009 to july 19 , 2009 , a wienermobile visited hawaii and was met with harsh criticism from the local outdoor circle , best known for pushing hawaii 's strict billboard ban through the 1927 legislature . a representative for the oscar mayer company insisted that the mobile hot-dog-on-a-bun did nothing wrong . there was no indication that an environmental impact statement would be demanded . few people believed that there was a real `` oscar mayer '' at the company , as the company for many years employed george molchan , a little person , as a mascot called `` little oscar , '' and mayer himself avoided publicity . he would travel nationwide with little oscar and the wienermobile . after being informed that there were choking risks from the whistles shaped like hot dogs that he would distribute to children on these publicity tours , he had 2 million of the whistles destroyed , despite assurances from doctors that the likelihood of risk was low . thomas ross was the son of a farmer , also thomas ross , and ann murray . he was born at wardheads , errol , and attended local schools before going to glasgow around 1855 to work as an assistant to architect alexander kirkland . he soon moved to the office of charles wilson , winning a measured drawing competition during his time there . he spent the proceeds on a study trip to yorkshire , visiting fountains abbey among other sites .
after consulting the nechung oracle about the proper escape route , the dalai lama and his staff put on disguises and slip out of lhasa under cover of darkness . during an arduous journey , throughout which they are pursued by the chinese , the dalai lama becomes very ill and experiences two personal visions , first that their trip to india will be propitious and that , similarly , their eventual return to tibet will also be propitious . the group eventually makes it to a small mountain pass on the indian border . as the dalai lama walks to the guard post , an indian guard approaches him , salutes , and inquires : `` are you the lord buddha ? '' the high lamas used several ways in which they can increase the chances of finding a person they claim to be the reincarnation . high lamas often visit lhamo la-tso , a lake in central tibet , and watch for a sign from the lake itself . this may be either a claimed ` vision ' or some ` indication ' of the direction in which to search , and this was how tenzin gyatso was determined to be the next dalai lama . it is said that palden lhamo , the female guardian spirit of the sacred lake lhamo la-tso promised gendun drup , the 1st dalai lama , in one of his visions `` that she would protect the reincarnation lineage of the dalai lamas . '' by the himalayan tradition , phowa is the discipline that is believed to transfer the mindstream to the intended body . upon the death of the dalai lama and consultation with the nechung oracle , a search for the lama 's yangsi , or reincarnation , is conducted . traditionally , it has been the responsibility of the high lamas of the gelugpa tradition and the tibetan government to find a person accepted as his reincarnation . the process can take around two or three years to identify the dalai lama , and for the 14th , tenzin gyatso , it was four years before he was found .
it 's hard to imagine how the past three days could have gone worse for republicans . the public impeachment hearings were never going to be a good thing for trump -- given that the proceedings were controlled by the house democratic majority and we knew , from a series of closed-door depositions over the past month , that the witnesses who would be called had a -rrb- expressed deep misgivings about president donald trump 's phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky on july 25 and b -rrb- suggested that there was a not-so-secret quid pro quo in place that unless the ukrainians announced an investigation into joe and hunter biden they would not get the white house meeting with the president they so desired . but even by those standards , what happened over the past 72 hours was a disaster the likes of which not even the most pessimistic republican could have predicted . the wednesday testimony of us ambassador to the european union gordon sondland was obviously the pivot point of the week . fiona hill , the last witness in two weeks of televised impeachment hearings , made the case against her old boss president donald trump better than democrats ever have . the former national security council official on thursday distilled the fog of shady dealings and competition between trump appointees and career bureaucrats with a crystal clear condemnation of his rogue foreign policy operation in ukraine . and she also effectively warned that the republican defense of the president -- by peddling ukraine conspiracy theories -- was in danger , in itself , of becoming an extension of the 2016 russian election scheme that is tearing american politics apart and draining public confidence in its democracy . hill -- a british-born , non-partisan russia expert who also wrote a book on vladimir putin -- was the star witness in a day of testimony that brought many of the threads of the democratic case together . fiona hill , president donald trump 's former top russia adviser , testified publicly on thursday before the house intelligence committee in the democratic-led impeachment inquiry into president donald trump . hill , a former national security adviser until she left the administration this summer , told lawmakers that us ambassador to the european union gordon sondland was involved in a `` domestic political errand '' in ukraine , while she and others were trying to stay involved in `` national security foreign policy . '' she told congress that it was obvious to her that when trump 's aides mentioned `` burisma , '' a ukrainian energy company , that they were really thinking about former vice president joe biden . and she forcefully rejected and dismantled the notion that ukraine meddled in the 2016 election to harm trump , calling it a `` fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the russian security services themselves . ''
after the september 11 attacks , some movies and tv shows deleted scenes or episodes set within the world trade center . for example , the simpsons episode `` the city of new york vs. homer simpson '' , which first aired in 1997 , was removed from syndication after the attacks because a scene showed the world trade center . songs that mentioned the world trade center were no longer aired on radio , and the release dates of some films , such as the 2001 -- 2002 films sidewalks of new york , people i know , and spider-man , were delayed so producers could remove scenes that included the world trade center . the 2001 film kissing jessica stein , which was shown at the toronto international film festival the day before the attacks , had to be modified before its general public release , so the filmmakers could delete the scenes that depicted the world trade center . the film 's director paul greengrass publicly stated that he `` stands behind the authenticity of captain phillips , '' despite complaints of inaccuracy with how the film portrays the events surrounding the hijacking , and `` at the end of the day , it is easy to make anonymous accusations against a film but the facts are clear captain phillips ' ship was attacked , and the ship and the crew and its cargo made it safely to port with no injuries or loss of life that 's the story we told , and it 's an accurate one . '' phillips ' first mate shane murphy stated in an interview with vulture published on october 13 , 2013 that he was satisfied with how the movie portrayed both phillips and himself , and stated that he was only disappointed that the film did n't show footage of the crews ' families at home or the president 's comments on the hijacking . in a later address before congress , the president declared , `` as a symbol of america 's resolve , my administration will work with congress , and these two leaders , to show the world that we will rebuild new york city . '' the immediate response from world trade center leaseholder larry silverstein was that `` it would be the tragedy of tragedies not to rebuild this part of new york . it would give the terrorists the victory they seek . '' however , by 2011 , only one building , 7 world trade center , had been rebuilt .

zelda first met the future novelist f. scott fitzgerald in july 1918 , when he had volunteered for the army , and was stationed at camp sheridan , outside montgomery . scott began to call her daily , and came into montgomery on his free days . he talked of his plans to be famous , and sent her a chapter of a book he was writing . he was so taken with zelda that he redrafted the character of rosalind connage in this side of paradise to resemble her . scott and zelda quickly became celebrities of new york , as much for their wild behavior as for the success of this side of paradise . they were ordered to leave both the biltmore hotel and the commodore hotel for their drunkenness . zelda once jumped into the fountain at union square . when dorothy parker first met them , zelda and scott were sitting atop a taxi . in april 1925 , back in paris , scott met ernest hemingway , whose career he did much to promote . hemingway and scott fitzgerald became firm friends , but zelda and hemingway disliked each other from their very first meeting , and she openly described him as `` bogus , '' `` that fairy with hair on his chest '' and `` phoney as a rubber check . '' she considered hemingway 's domineering macho persona to be merely a posture ; hemingway in turn , told scott that zelda was crazy . her dislike was probably not helped by scott 's repeated insistence that she recount the story of her affair with jozan to hemingway and his wife , hadley .
the american automobile association is suing the port authority of new york and new jersey over toll increases that recently went into effect at new york city bridges . aaa of new york and north jersey filed a complaint in federal court in manhattan tuesday , alleging that toll hikes that began on september 18 breach a federal law that requires interstate tolls be set at `` just and reasonable '' rates , according to a statement released by the agency . `` clearly , drivers are already paying more than their fair share -- and they are doing so at a time when federal , state and local authorities are hard pressed to meet routine road and bridge maintenance needs , '' said marta genovese , aaa new york 's vice president and counsel in a statement . the lawsuit seeks to stop the toll increases , which affect commuters using the lincoln and holland tunnels , the george washington , bayonne and goethals bridges , as well as the outerbridge crossing . lower manhattan was abuzz with rumors that british rock band radiohead would kick off an impromptu concert for an enthusiastic crowd friday in new york 's zuccotti park , where wall street protestors gathered for a second straight week . despite comments from the band 's spokesman that they would not play , hundreds congregated at the plaza after organizers from a group called occupy wall street announced the british rockers would soon arrive . when they never did , most of the crowd quickly dispersed . the park has remained a rallying point for demonstrators who have camped out in protest over what they say are social inequities derived from greed and corruption plaguing the current financial system . about 80 people were arrested on the eighth day of protests in new york on saturday , the greatest number since demonstrations started near wall street . earlier arrests in the week totaled about 20 on previous days for similar charges , according to new york city deputy commissioner paul j. browne . the latest arrests include disorderly conduct , resisting arrest , obstructing governmental administration and assaulting a police officer , according to browne . the protests started september 17 in lower manhattan and are aimed at drawing attention to the role powerful financial interests played in america 's spiraling economy .

as the republican presidential nomination race went into the primaries season , romney had not endorsed anyone but was one of the republican establishment figures who were becoming increasingly concerned about the front-runner status of new york businessman donald trump . romney publicly criticized trump for not releasing his taxes , saying there might be a `` bombshell '' in them . trump responded by calling romney `` one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of republican politics . '' then romney gave a speech on march 3 , 2016 , at the hinckley institute of politics , that represented a scathing attack on trump 's personal behavior , business performance , and domestic and foreign policy stances . by early 2014 , the lack of a clear mainstream republican candidate for the 2016 presidential election led some supporters , donors , and pollsters to suggest romney stage a third run . regarding such a possibility , romney at first responded , `` oh , no , no , no . no , no , no , no , no . no , no , no . '' romney himself thought he might be branded a `` loser for life '' and fade into an obscurity like michael dukakis -lrb- a similar figure with no obvious base of political support who had lost what his party considered a winnable presidential election -rrb- but , to the surprise of many political observers , that did not happen . romney re-emerged onto the political scene in the run-up to the 2014 u.s. midterm elections , endorsing , campaigning , and fundraising for a number of republican candidates , especially those running for the u.s. senate .

'' johnston asserted the preeminence of the sopranos as opposed to the wire and deadwood in a debate with television critics alan sepinwall and matt zoller seitz , both of whom would later include the sopranos in their 2016 book titled tv -lrb- the book -rrb- as the 2nd greatest american television series of all time , behind only the simpsons and ahead of the wire , with seitz considering the show 's ending to be the greatest ending for any television show . in december 1958 , after receiving a message from nikita khrushchev during a visit to the soviet union , humphrey returned insisting that the message was not negative toward america . in february 1959 , humphrey said khrushchev 's comments , in which he called humphrey a purveyor of fairy tales , should have been ignored by american newspapers . in a september address to the national stationary and office equipment association , humphrey called for further inspection of khrushchev 's `` live and let live '' doctrine and maintained the cold war could be won by using american `` weapons of peace '' . the series was often described as `` a show about nothing '' . however , seinfeld in 2014 stated `` the pitch for the show , the real pitch , when larry and i went to nbc in 1988 , was we want to show how a comedian gets his material . the show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later , and larry and i to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show , because to us it 's the opposite of that . '' much of the show 's humor is based upon repeated use of irony , incongruity , and -lrb- oftentimes unfortunate -rrb- coincidence -lrb- s -rrb- as plot devices for many of the individual episodes ' plots and humorous moments .
the afghani -lrb- sign : afs or afs ; code : afn ; pashto : افغانۍ ; dari : افغانی -rrb- is the currency of the islamic republic of afghanistan , which is issued by the nation 's central bank called da afghanistan bank . it is nominally subdivided into 100 puls -lrb- پول -rrb- , although there are no pul coins currently in circulation . in 2019 , one u.s. dollar was exchanged for approximately 75 afghanis .
powerless to act after yet another mass shooting , all the president of the united states could do was vent . barack obama has clasped grieving parents close . his voice has broken as he 's read aloud the names of murdered kids . he 's wept in the white house briefing room . news of thursday 's deadly shooting at umpqua community college in roseburg , oregon , quickly reverberated through congress , the 2016 campaign trail and the white house , with president barack obama making the 15th statement of his presidency addressing gun violence . obama said `` thoughts and prayers '' are no longer enough to prevent another mass shooting , calling for more gun-control legislation . `` as i said just a few months ago , and i said a few months before that , and i said each time i see one of these mass shootings , our thoughts and prayers are not enough . it 's not enough , '' obama said from the white house briefing room . following obama 's election , many pondered the existence of a `` postracial america . '' however , lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent , and many african-americans expressed outrage over what they saw as `` racial venom '' directed at obama 's presidency . in july 2009 , prominent african-american harvard professor henry louis gates , jr. , was arrested at his cambridge , massachusetts home by a local police officer , sparking a controversy after obama stated that the police acted `` stupidly '' in handling the incident . to reduce tensions , obama invited gates and the police officer to the white house in what became known as the `` beer summit '' .
yellowstone follows `` the dutton family , led by john dutton , who controls the largest contiguous ranch in the united states . the ranch is under constant attack by those it borders -- land developers , an indian reservation , and united states of america 's first national park . it is an intense study of a violent world far from media scrutiny , where land grabs earn developers billions , and politicians are bought and sold by the world 's largest oil and lumber corporations . where unsolved murders are not news , they are a consequence of living in the new frontier . yellowstone was part of a federally governed territory . with no state government that could assume stewardship of the land , the federal government took on direct responsibility for the park , the official first national park of the united states . the combined effort and interest of conservationists , politicians and the northern pacific railroad ensured the passage of enabling legislation by the united states congress to create yellowstone national park . theodore roosevelt and his group of conservationists , the boone and crockett club , were already an active campaigners , and so influential , as good stump speakers were highly necessary in the pre-telecommunications era , was highly influential in convincing fellow republicans and big business to back the bill . because the policies and activities of the department of the interior and many of its agencies have a substantial impact in the western united states , the secretary of the interior has typically come from a western state ; only three of the individuals to hold the office since 1949 have not been from a state lying west of the mississippi river . the current interior secretary is david bernhardt , who held the office in an acting capacity until april 2019 . he succeeded ryan zinke who resigned on january 2 , 2019 .
alex forbes attends a boarding school where his father is principal . a new student , nigel colbie , is placed in alex 's room . nigel has a father who is in the same secret society as alex 's father . nigel , however , is unusual , and in alex 's words `` had this morbid fascination with all things dead . '' according to lehman , the concept is just a description of how ideas work , not advocacy of extreme policy proposals . in an interview with the new york times , he said , `` it just explains how ideas come in and out of fashion , the same way that gravity explains why something falls to the earth . i can use gravity to drop an anvil on your head , but that would be wrong . i could also use gravity to throw you a life preserver ; that would be good .

the supreme court of the united states -lrb- scotus -rrb- is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the united states . it has ultimate -lrb- and largely discretionary -rrb- appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law , and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases , specifically `` all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party '' . the court holds the power of judicial review , the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the u.s. constitution . it is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the constitution or statutory law . one of the informal traditions of the american legal system , derived from the common law , is that all litigants are guaranteed at least one appeal after a final judgment on the merits . however , appeal is merely a privilege provided by statute in 47 states and in federal judicial proceedings ; the u.s. supreme court has repeatedly ruled that there is no federal constitutional right to an appeal . the supreme court firmly established its power to declare laws unconstitutional in marbury v. madison -lrb- 1803 -rrb- , consummating the american system of checks and balances . in explaining the power of judicial review , chief justice john marshall stated that the authority to interpret the law was the particular province of the courts , part of the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is . his contention was not that the court had privileged insight into constitutional requirements , but that it was the constitutional duty of the judiciary , as well as the other branches of government , to read and obey the dictates of the constitution .
mike pence might not have helped donald trump in tuesday night 's vice presidential debate -- but he certainly helped his own political future . the indiana governor largely batted away hillary clinton running mate tim kaine 's recitations of trump 's most incendiary comments , dismissing kaine 's pressure as `` pre-done lines '' from an `` insult-driven campaign . '' he sidestepped trump 's most politically toxic remarks -- on muslims , mexicans , a disabled journalist and more -- and showed how a more conventional republican could attack clinton . it had some republicans crowing about pence 's chances in 2020 -- and others saying they wish he could be promoted to the top of the ticket in 2016 . donald trump and mike pence are a study in contrasts when it comes to their debate preparation . as the vice presidential candidates prepare to take the stage for a televised debate this tuesday , a campaign official said gop vice presidential candidate mike pence has been preparing for tuesday 's debate since the day the indiana governor received the call to join the republican ticket in july . pence 's debate preparations contrast sharply with the much looser sessions used by trump in the weeks running up to his first face-off with hillary clinton . trump never practiced against a stand-in for clinton . `` some calm , something peaceful . '' that is what rob chapman is hoping will come out of the vice presidential debate being held in his hometown of farmville , virginia . `` i think they have a better disposition , they should be able to get along , '' chapman , the 45-year-old manager of walker 's diner on north main street , says of vice presidential nominees mike pence and tim kaine . after the fireworks americans saw in the general election 's first presidential debate , many expect the vice presidential debate to be a more sober affair -- free of name calling , shimmies , or , hopefully , audio issues .
when it comes to dealing with the confederate flag , jeb bush is n't leaving much room for interpretation in his stance on the issue . the former governor recalled saturday how he ordered the removal of the flag from florida state grounds in 2001 , adding that he believes south carolina will do `` the right thing '' as the state decides what to do about the controversial symbol that flies at the capitol in columbia . his comments come as 2016 presidential candidates face questions over how to handle the racially sensitive debate that follows the massacre of nine african-american parishioners by a white gunman in a charleston church this week . `` my position on how to address the confederate flag is clear , '' he said in a written statement . south carolina gov. nikki haley on monday called for the removal of the confederate flag from the grounds of the state house . `` today we are here in a moment of unity in our state without ill will to say it is time to remove the flag from our capitol grounds , '' said haley , a republican and the state 's first non-white governor , while flanked by a diverse group of south carolina politicians . `` this flag , while an integral part of our past , does not represent the future of our great state , '' she said . all of a sudden , republican presidential candidates found a position on the confederate flag monday . in the days after the racially-motivated massacre of nine african-americans at a church in charleston , many of the gop candidates tried to skirt the issue of the confederate flag -- calling for prayer , a time for grieving , and support for the families of the nine victims . in some cases , they chided reporters for bringing up `` politics '' at such a sensitive time . but within seconds of south carolina gov.
in 1864 , the honourable william young purchased the heavily indebted halifax mechanic 's library and donated the collection to establish the city 's first free public library , the citizens ' free library . anyone `` above the age of 18 who were of a known and respectable nature '' could borrow one book at a time . the library found a permanent home in 1890 on the second floor of city hall , where the office of the mayor of halifax is now located . it served as city hall of independent woodlawn , alabama for only two years , before the city was incorporated into birmingham . it included `` most of the town 's public functions within its walls -- city offices , the court and jail , the fire department , an auditorium for meetings and performances , and the first branch of the greater birmingham library , which began with 890 books . relieved of its city hall status after the annexation , the upstairs became used entirely by the library -lrb- they did not build separate quarters until 1950 -rrb- , while the street level was converted on one side to retail spaces , the longest-term occupant of which was the morgan brothers department store . the fire station remained until 1928 , and subsequently that half of the first floor was converted to commercial use . as fish argues in black power/white control two picked issues that mobilized resident participation , and at the same time built power for the organization to take on large outside entities like the university and the city -lrb- i.e. mayor daley -rrb- . the group took part in the flurry of activity surrounding the freedom rides and the civil rights movement by loading up over 40 buses of people from woodlawn and riding to city hall to register to vote . they also rallied against slum landlords and cheating business owners .
in order to make project management effective , the managers use risk management tools . it is necessary to assume the measures referring to the same risk of the project and accomplishing its objectives . chronologically , project risk management may begin in recognizing a threat , or by examining an opportunity . for example , these may be competitor developments or novel products . due to lack of definition , this is frequently performed qualitatively , or semi-quantitatively , using product or averaging models . this approach is used to prioritize possible solutions , where necessary . with the above disciplines of operational , financial and underwriting risk management , the concepts of risk , risk management and individual risks are nearly interchangeable ; being either personnel or monetary impacts respectively . impacts in project risk management are more diverse , overlapping monetary , schedule , capability , quality and engineering disciplines . for this reason , in project risk management , it is necessary to specify the differences -lrb- paraphrased from the `` department of defense risk , issue , and opportunity management guide for defense acquisition programs '' -rrb- :
`` universal search '' was launched by google on may 16 , 2007 as an idea that merged the results from different kinds of search types into one . prior to universal search , a standard google search would consist of links only to websites . universal search , however , incorporates a wide variety of sources , including websites , news , pictures , maps , blogs , videos , and more , all shown on the same search results page . marissa mayer , then-vice president of search products and user experience , described the goal of universal search as `` we 're attempting to break down the walls that traditionally separated our various search properties and integrate the vast amounts of information available into one simple set of search results . initially , microsoft reportedly played down the threat from chrome and predicted that most people would embrace internet explorer 8 . opera software said that `` chrome will strengthen the web as the biggest application platform in the world '' . but by february 25 , 2010 , businessweek had reported that `` for the first time in years , energy and resources are being poured into browsers , the ubiquitous programs for accessing content on the web . credit for this trend -- a boon to consumers -- goes to two parties . despite google search 's immense index , sources generally assume that google is only indexing less than 5 % of the total internet , with the rest belonging to the deep web , inaccessible through its search tools .
dönitz admired hitler and was vocal about the qualities he perceived in hitler 's leadership . in august 1943 he praised his foresightedness and confidence ; `` anyone who thinks he can do better than the führer is stupid . '' dönitz 's relationship with hitler strengthened through to the end of the war , particularly after the 20 july plot , for the naval staff officers were not involved ; when news of it came there was indignation in the okm . even after the war , dönitz said he could never have joined the conspirators . even during his imprisonment , after nuremberg , with the crimes of the nazi state well-known , dönitz was unable to rid himself of his antisemitism . in april 1953 , he told speer that if it was the choice of the americans and not the jews , he would have been released . at the nuremberg trials , dönitz claimed the statement about the `` poison of jewry '' was regarding `` the endurance , the power to endure , of the people , as it was composed , could be better preserved than if there were jewish elements in the nation . '' later , during the nuremberg trials , dönitz claimed to know nothing about the extermination of jews and declared that nobody among `` my men thought about violence against jews . '' dönitz told leon goldensohn , an american psychiatrist at nuremberg , `` i never had any idea of the goings-on as far as jews were concerned . hitler said each man should take care of his business and mine was u-boats and the navy .

a diversity paradox looms over the democrats ' hopes of recapturing the white house in 2020 . the field of democratic presidential candidates includes the most racial minorities ever , and more minorities will likely vote next year in the party 's primaries than ever before . yet four white contenders consistently lead in state and national polls , partly because of the outsized influence of the two virtually all-white states that lead off the election calendar , iowa and new hampshire . those four white contenders -- former vice president joe biden , sens. it 's popular -- particularly on twitter ! -- to blast former vice president joe biden and declare his presidential hopes dead . and given his poor fundraising through the end of september and his , uh , middling debate performances , there are some real facts behind that perception . but one of the under-told storylines of the 2020 campaign to date is that despite the defeatist conventional wisdom , the support for the former vice president has -- and continues -- to show surprising resilience . criticism of buttigieg 's handling of racial issues in south bend has led to doubts about his ability to attract black voters . following the controversial shooting of eric logan , an african american man , by a white south bend police officer in june , 2019 , buttigieg was compelled to hold off his campaign to commit his undivided focus to the emerging public reaction . buttigieg convened a local town hall on june 23 , where he heard the grievances of disaffected activists in the african american community as well as relatives of eric logan . the local police union accused buttigieg of making decisions for political gain .

in november 2002 , kbr was tasked to plan oil well firefighting in iraq , and in february 2003 was issued a contract to conduct the work . critics contend that it was a no-bid contract , awarded due to dick cheney 's position as vice president . concern was also expressed that the contract could allow kbr to pump and distribute iraqi oil . others contend , however , that this was not strictly a no-bid contract , and was invoked under a contract that kbr won `` in a competitive bid process . '' halliburton has become the object of several controversies involving the iraq war and the company 's ties to former u.s. vice president dick cheney . cheney retired from the company during the 2000 u.s. presidential election campaign with a severance package worth $ 36 million . as of 2004 , he had received $ 398,548 in deferred compensation from halliburton while vice president . cheney was chairman and ceo of halliburton company from 1995 to 2000 and has received stock options from halliburton . the company has been involved in numerous controversies , including its involvement with dick cheney -- as u.s. secretary of defense , then ceo of the company , then vice president of the united states -- and the iraq war , and the deepwater horizon , for which it agreed to settle outstanding legal claims against it by paying litigants $ 1.1 billion .
the democratic party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the united states , along with its main rival , the republican party . tracing its heritage back to thomas jefferson and james madison 's democratic-republican party , the modern-day democratic party was founded around 1828 by supporters of andrew jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party.in its early years , the party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . since franklin d. roosevelt and his new deal coalition in the 1930s , the democratic party has promoted a social liberal platform . well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and southern conservative-populist wings ; following the new deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the south . the democratic party , also known as the minjoo party of korea -lrb- korean : 더불어민주당 ; hanja : 더불어民主黨 ; rr : deobureominjudang ; lit . together democratic party ; short form 민주 , 더민주 `` minjoo '' , `` deominjoo '' , now known as `` minjudang '' 민주당 in south korean media since 2016 -rrb- , formerly the new politics alliance for democracy -lrb- npad -rrb- , is a centrist , liberal political party in south korea . the party was founded on 26 march 2014 as a merger of the democratic party and the preparatory committee of the new political vision party -lrb- npvp -rrb- . the former democratic party was legally absorbed into the npad after the latter 's creation , while the preparatory committee of the npvp was dissolved , with members who supported the merger joining the npad individually . the democrats -lrb- portuguese : democratas , dem -rrb- is a political party in brazil . it was founded in 1985 under the name of liberal front party -lrb- partido da frente liberal , pfl -rrb- from a dissidence of the defunct pds , successor to the arena , the official party during the military dictatorship of 1964 -- 1985 . it changed to its current name in 2007 . the original name reflected the party 's support of free market policies , rather than the identification with international liberal parties .

senators used to hold their seats for life ; however , under the british north america act , 1965 -lrb- now known as the constitution act , 1965 -rrb- , members , save for those appointed prior to the change , may not sit in the senate after reaching the age of 75 . the last member of the senate who served past the age of 75 was john michael macdonald , who had been appointed on the advice of john diefenbaker in 1960 and served until his death , at the age of 91 in 1997 . orville howard phillips was the last senator appointed for life to leave the body : he was appointed on the advice of diefenbaker in 1963 and served in the senate until 1999 , when he voluntarily resigned a month before turning 75 . while most senators hold their seat until the mandatory age of retirement , andy thompson stepped down 20 months ahead of his scheduled retirement after critics drew attention to his poor attendance record while he continued to draw his salary . the first constitution of canada did not explicitly bar women from sitting as senators . however , until the end of the 1920s , only men had been appointed to the body . in 1927 , five canadian women -- known as the famous five -- requested that the supreme court determine whether women were eligible to become senators . specifically , they asked whether women were considered `` persons '' under the british north america act , 1867 , which provided : `` the governor general shall ... summon qualified persons to the senate ; and ... every person so summoned shall become and be a member of the senate and a senator . '' the approval of both houses is necessary for legislation and , thus , the senate can reject bills passed by the commons . between 1867 and 1987 , the senate rejected fewer than two bills per year , but this has increased in more recent years . although legislation can normally be introduced in either chamber , the majority of government bills originate in the house of commons , with the senate acting as the chamber of `` sober second thought '' -lrb- as it was called by sir john a. macdonald , canada 's first prime minister -rrb- .
the united states of america -lrb- usa -rrb- , commonly known as the united states -lrb- u.s. or us -rrb- or america , is a country comprising 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . at 3.8 million square miles -lrb- 9.8 million km2 -rrb- , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of europe . most of the country is located in central north america between canada and mexico . with an estimated population of over 328 million , the u.s. is the third most populous country .
stones carved in shapes resembling clusters of spheres or knobs have been found in scotland and may be as much as 4,000 years old . some of these stones show not only the symmetries of the five platonic solids , but also some of the relations of duality amongst them -lrb- that is , that the centres of the faces of the cube gives the vertices of an octahedron -rrb- . examples of these stones are on display in the john evans room of the ashmolean museum at oxford university . why these objects were made , or how their creators gained the inspiration for them , is a mystery . in 2019 , schulte was featured on netflix 's popular series , the toys that made us , along with his writing and business partner , john besmehn , on the segment discussing their writing involvement with the teenage mutant ninja turtles . it is also possible that the etruscans preceded the greeks in their awareness of at least some of the regular polyhedra , as evidenced by the discovery near padua -lrb- in northern italy -rrb- in the late 19th century of a dodecahedron made of soapstone , and dating back more than 2,500 years -lrb- lindemann , 1987 -rrb- .

'' obama said in an interview with abc news , `` at a certain point i 've just concluded that for me , personally , it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same-sex couples should be able to get married .

the following table of united states cities by crime rate is based on federal bureau of investigation uniform crime reports statistics from 2017 for the top 100 most populous cities in america that have reported data to the fbi ucr system . the ucr program was based upon work by the international association of chiefs of police -lrb- iacp -rrb- and the social science research council -lrb- ssrc -rrb- throughout the 1920s to create a uniform national set of crime statistics , reliable for analysis . in 1927 , the iacp created the committee on uniform crime reporting to determine statistics for national comparisons . the committee determined seven crimes fundamental to comparing crime rates : murder and non-negligent manslaughter , forcible rape , burglary , aggravated assault , larceny and motor vehicle theft -lrb- the eighth , arson , was added under a congressional directive in 1979 -rrb- . the early program was managed by the iacp , prior to fbi involvement , done through a monthly report . research using a series of victim surveys in 18 countries of the european union , funded by the european commission , has reported -lrb- 2005 -rrb- that the level of crime in europe has fallen back to the levels of 1990 , and notes that levels of common crime have shown declining trends in the u.s. , canada , australia and other industrialized countries as well . the european researchers say a general consensus identifies demographic change as the leading cause for this international trend . although homicide and robbery rates rose in the u.s. in the 1980s , by the end of the century they had declined by 40 % .

polls show mitt romney trailing president barack obama in just about every one of the swing states where the 2012 campaign is being waged . but romney appears to be in deeper trouble in ohio than elsewhere , an alarming development for republicans who know that the candidate 's white house chances begin and end with the kind of middle-class voters who reside in places such as akron , cincinnati and zanesville . so why exactly is romney trailing ? two surveys released in recent days , one from the ohio newspaper association and another from the washington post , crystallized the challenge facing romney as he embarks on his second straight day of campaigning in the buckeye state . president barack obama and republican presidential nominee mitt romney went head-to-head on china , taxes , and jobs on wednesday as the two campaigned throughout ohio . both sought to illustrate what the next four years would be like under their leadership as new polls indicated obama exceeding 50 % support among likely voters in ohio , florida and pennsylvania . those are all swing states that combined will account for nearly a quarter of the electoral votes needed to win the white house . surveys suggest that romney has lost his edge on the economy , the centerpiece of his campaign to highlight slow growth , trade tensions , and stubbornly high unemployment under obama 's leadership . with mitt romney beginning to tighten the gap between president obama and himself in the latest cnn polls , governor ted strickland -lrb- d-oh -rrb- joins `` starting point '' to discuss the upcoming presidential debate . strickland argues that the obama campaign in ohio is the `` strongest '' he 's `` ever seen '' with an extensive grassroots effort . `` you do n't count your chickens before they hatch and we 're not going to do that , '' strickland says . `` but we 're voting in ohio beginning today and people stayed up all night , camped out all night here in ohio , waiting to be able to cast their votes this morning . '' strickland also argues that despite the high unemployment rate , obama is able to remain a slight lead in the polls because many americans have `` started to see '' success `` in the midwest '' and `` in manufacturing states . '' `` things are improving in america and we ought not to just turn around and go back to the same failed policies that brought on this recession in the first place , '' strickland says .
on september 17 , 2003 , in little rock , arkansas , clark announced his intention to run in the presidential primary election for the democratic party nomination , becoming the tenth and last democrat to do so -lrb- coming many months after the others -rrb- : `` my name is wes clark . i am from little rock , arkansas , and i am here to announce that i intend to seek the presidency of the united states of america . '' he said , `` we 're going to run a campaign that will move this country forward , not back . '' during john kerry 's candidacy in the 2004 u.s. presidential campaign , a political issue that gained widespread public attention was kerry 's vietnam war record . in television advertisements and a book called unfit for command , co-authored by john o'neill and jerome corsi , the swift boat veterans for truth -lrb- sbvt -rrb- , a 527 group later known as the swift vets and pows for truth , questioned details of his military service record and circumstances relating to the award of his combat medals . their campaign against kerry 's presidential bid received widespread publicity , but was later discredited and gave rise to the neologism `` swiftboating '' , to describe an unfair or untrue political attack . defenders of kerry 's service record , including former crewmates , stated that allegations made by sbvt were false . with the continuing controversy that had surrounded the military service of george w. bush since the 2000 presidential election -lrb- when he was accused of having used his father 's political influence to gain entrance to the texas air national guard , thereby protecting himself from conscription into the united states army , and possible service in the vietnam war -rrb- , john kerry 's contrasting status as a decorated vietnam war veteran posed a problem for bush 's re-election campaign , which republicans sought to counter by calling kerry 's war record into question . as the presidential campaign of 2004 developed , approximately 250 members of a group called swift boat veterans for truth -lrb- sbvt , later renamed swift vets and pows for truth -rrb- opposed kerry 's campaign . the group held press conferences , ran ads and endorsed a book questioning kerry 's service record and his military awards . the group included several members of kerry 's unit , such as larry thurlow , who commanded a swift boat alongside of kerry 's , and stephen gardner , who served on kerry 's boat .

in the 1940s , dolores began helping her husband on his tours entertaining u.s. troops overseas and she would continue to do so for over 50 years . in 1990 , she was the only female entertainer allowed to perform in saudi arabia . for his service to his country through the uso , he was awarded the sylvanus thayer award by the united states military academy at west point in 1968 . a 1997 act of congress signed by president bill clinton named hope an `` honorary veteran .

johnson & johnson has set several positive goals to keep the company environmentally friendly and was ranked third among the united states 's largest companies in newsweek 's `` green rankings '' . some examples are the reduction in water use , waste , and energy use and an increased level of transparency . johnson & johnson agreed to change its packaging of plastic bottles used in the manufacturing process , switching their packaging of liquids to non-polyvinyl chloride containers . the corporation is working with the climate northwest initiative and the epa national environmental performance track program . johnson & johnson is an american multinational corporation founded in 1886 that develops medical devices , pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods . its common stock is a component of the dow jones industrial average and the company is ranked no. 37 on the 2018 fortune 500 list of the largest united states corporations by total revenue . j&j is one of the world 's most valuable companies . a declaration made by the u.s. upon its ratification of the 1949 geneva conventions includes a reservation that pre-1905 u.s. domestic uses of the red cross , such as johnson & johnson 's , would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on `` aircraft , vessels , vehicles , buildings or other structures , or upon the ground , '' i.e. , uses which could be confused with its military uses . this means that the u.s. did not agree to any interpretation of the 1949 geneva conventions that would overrule johnson & johnson 's trademark . the american red cross continues to recognize the validity of johnson & johnson 's trademark .
the term buffalo is sometimes considered to be a misnomer for this animal , and could be confused with `` true '' buffalos , the asian water buffalo and the african buffalo . however , the name buffalo is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for american buffalo or bison . samuel de champlain applied the term buffalo -lrb- buffles in french -rrb- to the bison in 1616 -lrb- published 1619 -rrb- , after seeing skins and a drawing shown to him by members of the nipissing first nation , who said they travelled forty days -lrb- from east of lake huron -rrb- to trade with another nation who hunted the animals . in english usage , the term buffalo dates to 1625 in north america , when the term was first recorded for the american mammal . buffalo hunting -lrb- hunting of the american bison -rrb- was an activity fundamental to the indigenous peoples of the plains , which was later adopted by american professional hunters as well as by the u.s. government to sabotage a central foodstuff of local tribes and force them into reservations , leading to the near-extinction of the species around 1890 . though buffalo were being slaughtered in masses , many tribes perceived the buffalo as part of the natural world -- something guaranteed to them by the creator . in fact , for some plains indigenous peoples , bison are known as the first people . many tribes did not grasp the concept of species extinction . the american bison or simply bison -lrb- bison bison -rrb- , also commonly known as the american buffalo or simply buffalo , is a north american species of bison that once roamed north america in vast herds . its historical range , by 9000 bce , is described as the great bison belt , a tract of rich grassland that ran from alaska to the gulf of mexico , east to the atlantic seaboard -lrb- nearly to the atlantic tidewater in some areas -rrb- as far north as new york and south to georgia and , according to some sources , down to florida , with sightings in north carolina near buffalo ford on the catawba river as late as 1750 . it nearly became extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle . with a population in excess of 60 million in the late 18th century , the species was down to 541 animals by 1889 .
nato leaders gathering to mark the alliance 's 70th anniversary in london face multiple challenges -- including the uncertainty of what president donald trump might do . trump opened last year 's nato summit with a snarling dismissal of its `` delinquent '' members for not spending more on their defense budgets and a jibe at germany for being `` a captive of russia . '' this year , trump is under new pressures -- the 2020 election campaign has begun and he faces an impeachment inquiry that begins its next phase before the house judiciary committee on december 4 , the second day of the nato meeting . the concern , say nato watchers , is that the gathering of world leaders will provide an irresistible international stage for the us president to let rip with another series of blistering attacks on nato members to fire up his base back home . if allied leaders had hoped that us president donald trump 's presence at a summit in the london area marking the 70th anniversary of the alliance this week would promote unity among old friends they probably left disappointed . trump 's visit was marked by showdowns between leaders , lengthy and freewheeling appearances by the president before the media , an abrupt news conference cancellation and an extraordinary row over a viral video . trump 's relationship with nato trump has long challenged and pushed nato members to spend more on defense and has even suggested the alliance is obsolete . ahead of the summit he successfully cut the us contribution to nato 's budget . president donald trump attended a lucrative fundraiser with wealthy americans residing in london in between meetings ahead of the nato summit on tuesday , part of what appears to be a larger effort by the president to use his european visit to highlight his accomplishments on the world stage . the white house billed the event , which was closed to the press , as `` a roundtable with supporters '' and a republican source familiar with the event 's plans tells cnn that the fundraiser was hosted by trump victory , a joint fundraising committee run by the republican national committee and trump 's campaign . a trump campaign official said the event was expected to raise $ 3 million . it 's not uncommon for american presidents and candidates to raise funds from americans living abroad .
following world war ii , whitmore appeared on broadway in the role of the sergeant in command decision . metro-goldwyn-mayer gave whitmore a contract , but his role in the film adaptation was played by van johnson . his first major picture for mgm was battleground , in a role that was turned down by spencer tracy , to whom whitmore bore a noted physical resemblance . he was nominated for the academy award for best supporting actor for this role , and won the golden globe award as best performance by an actor in a supporting role . this success came amid a brief period of turmoil in the mid-1990s . campanelli was fired midway through the 1992-93 season after athletic director bob bockrath heard campanelli berate his players with obscenity-laden tirades following two losses . assistant todd bozeman finished out the season , and was named permanent head coach after leading the bears to an upset of two-time defending champion duke in the ncaa tournament . bozeman himself was pushed out two months before the 1996-97 season after it emerged that he 'd funneled $ 30,000 over two years to the parents of star recruit jelani gardner so they could make the drive to see their son play . his first play on broadway -- command decision -- in which whitmore played the part of tech sergeant harold evans , was the smash hit of 1947 , and whitmore won the tony award for `` best newcomer of the season . '' whitmore continued to be active in the theatre for all of his career , performing on broadway , at ford 's theatre in washington dc , and on tour . he later won the title `` king of the one man show '' after appearing in the solo vehicles will rogers ' usa -lrb- 1970 -rrb- -lrb- repeating the role for tv in 1972 -rrb- ; as harry truman in give 'em hell , harry ! -lrb- 1975 -rrb- -lrb- repeating the role in the film version , for which he was nominated for an oscar -rrb- ; and as theodore roosevelt in bully -lrb- 1977 -rrb- , although the latter production did not repeat the success of the first two .
the hobby lobby smuggling scandal is a series of events starting in 2009 when representatives of hobby lobby received a large number of clay bulla and tablets . the artifacts were intended for the museum of the bible , funded by the evangelical christian green family , which owns the oklahoma-based chain of craft stores . internal staff had warned superiors that the items had dubious provenance and were potentially stolen . in 2017 the united states district court for the eastern district of new york directed hobby lobby to return the artifacts and pay a fine of us$ 3,000,000 . scott thumma , a dean and professor of sociology of religion at hartford seminary , defended hobby lobby during the smuggling controversy . thuma stated : `` many of the collections of our great national museums and universities are full of the very objects that hobby lobby is being fined for smuggling and are seldom required to return or pay compensation . '' barbara green , co-founder of hobby lobby , said `` today , the nation 's highest court has reaffirmed the vital importance of religious liberty as one of our country 's founding principles . the court 's decision is a victory , not just for our family business , but for all who seek to live out their faith .

the gallup poll is the division of gallup that regularly conducts public opinion polls . gallup poll results , analysis , and videos are published daily in the form of data-driven news . conducting polls brings the company financial losses of about $ 10 million a year , but gives gallup company the visibility of a well-known brand , which helps promote its corporate research . in the united states , presidential job approval ratings were introduced by george gallup in the late 1930s -lrb- most likely 1937 -rrb- to gauge public support for the president of the united states during their term . an approval rating is a percentage determined by a polling which indicates the percentage of respondents to an opinion poll who approve of a particular person or program . typically , an approval rating is given to a politician based on responses to a poll in which a sample of people are asked whether they approve or disapprove of that particular political figure . a question might ask : in 2006 , most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of bush . respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security . in 2007 , the pew global attitudes project reported that during the bush presidency , attitudes towards the united states , and towards americans , became less favorable around the world . the pew research center 's 2007 global attitudes poll found that in only nine countries of 47 did most respondents express `` a lot of confidence '' or `` some confidence '' in bush : ethiopia , ghana , india , israel , ivory coast , kenya , mali , nigeria , and uganda .
english is a west germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval england and eventually became a global lingua franca . it is named after the angles , one of the germanic tribes that migrated to the area of great britain that later took their name , as england . both names derive from anglia , a peninsula in the baltic sea . the language is closely related to frisian and low saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other germanic languages , particularly norse -lrb- a north germanic language -rrb- , and to a greater extent by latin and french.english has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical , geographical , and political context in which it is used . american is derived from america , a term originally denoting all of the new world -lrb- also called the americas -rrb- . in some expressions , it retains this pan-american sense , but its usage has evolved over time and , for various historical reasons , the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america . in modern english , american generally refers to persons or things related to the united states of america ; among native english speakers this usage is almost universal , with any other use of the term requiring specification . american english -lrb- ame , ae , ameng , useng , en-us -rrb- , sometimes called united states english or u.s. english , is the set of varieties of the english language native to the united states . american english is a particularly influential form of english worldwide.english is the most widely spoken language in the united states and is the de facto common language used by the federal and state governments , to the extent that all laws and compulsory education presume english as the primary language . english is explicitly given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments . while the local courts in some divisions of the united states grant equivalent status to both english and another language -- for example , english and spanish in puerto rico -- under federal law , english is still the official language for any matters being referred to the united states district court for the territory.the use of english in the united states is a result of british colonization of the americas .
leaders of some countries reserved enthusiasm for the obama inauguration , with coverage of the event even muted in some places . cuban president raúl castro , brother of former cuban president fidel castro , declared that '' looks like a good man , i hope he is lucky '' , while ricardo alarcón , president of the cuban legislature , admitted in his comments about obama that `` the incoming president ` is a big question mark . ' '' iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki expressed hope for openness for a new direction , noting that `` if obama chooses the right path , compensates the past , lifts hostility and u.s. hegemony , and revises the previous political mistakes , we will have no hostility . '' state-owned channel one russia , russia 's flagship early evening news show , covered obama 's presidential inauguration as a minor news story , devoting much of the day 's airtime instead to the gas war with ukraine . after the inaugural ceremony on the west front of the u.s. capitol , president obama , first lady michelle obama , vice president joe biden and dr. jill biden escorted former president george w. bush and former first lady laura bush to a departure ceremony on the east side of the u.s. capitol . before the luncheon and in keeping with tradition , president obama signed his first presidential orders in the president 's room at the capitol , and then signed the guest book for the luncheon . the first order signed by obama was a proclamation declaring his inauguration day a `` national day of renewal and reconciliation '' , in which he called `` upon all of our citizens to serve one another and the common purpose of remaking this nation for our new century '' . next , obama signed orders to officially present the nominations for his cabinet and several sub‑cabinet officials to the u.s. congress for its approval . on june 4 , john mccain proposed a series of ten joint town hall meetings with obama , at which the two could engage each other . obama first agreed in principle to the notion , but later rejected mccain 's proposal , offering instead one town-hall event on the independence day holiday and four traditional debate-style joint appearances . hank paulson , president bush 's treasury secretary , said obama 's comprehension of the financial crisis compared to mccain 's was as broad as `` night and day '' . mccain 's confidence vastly lowered when obama questioned his ideas on the financial crisis in a meeting on september 25 at the white house with bush and other congressmen .
