Road oncologists at Yale-New Haven Hospital held a press conference Tuesday to announce that Interstate 95, the main conduit running along the country’s Eastern Seaboard, had begun treatment for stage III highway cancer, an advanced and often terminal form of the disease.According to doctors, the 1,900-mile roadway, which had been battling illness since late September, was diagnosed after Connecticut motorists reported having to stop for a strange, previously unseen bump, later determined to be an 8-mile-long tumor lodged in its southbound shoulder.“When we analyzed the asphalt biopsy, all of our worst suspicions were confirmed—classic case of late-stage highway cancer,” said Dr. Angela Everett, the 15-state thoroughfare’s primary physician.
