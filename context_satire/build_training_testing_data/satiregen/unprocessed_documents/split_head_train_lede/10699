Stressing the importance of being able to financially support their kids during one of the most significant periods in their lives, a growing number of parents are opting to put aside money for their children’s unemployment, a report published Wednesday by the Brookings Institution has revealed.According to the report, parents across the United States are saving a greater portion of their incomes than ever before, hoping they will be in a position to help with costs when their kids reach young adulthood and begin their jobless years.“Parents naturally want to provide for their children’s future, and today they are increasingly aware of how much they will need to pay when their child enters unemployment,” said economist Belinda Sayers, the report’s lead author, who noted that the average cost of a year of joblessness was steadily rising, adding that families with two, three, or more kids had to put even more aside for helping multiple children through unemployment.
