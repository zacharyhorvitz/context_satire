Saying that the thought had been on her mind for a while and that she felt she needed to bring it out in the open, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reportedly asked her husband Bill if he still finds her electable Tuesday evening.According to sources, the 66-year-old stateswoman broached the subject while the two were both reading in bed, reportedly looking up from her page before revealing to her husband that she fears he no longer finds her to be a desirable candidate.“Bill, I want you to be honest with me: Do my political prospects still look good to you?” asked Hillary, assuring her husband that she could handle his candid answer, but that she would like to know one way or the other.
