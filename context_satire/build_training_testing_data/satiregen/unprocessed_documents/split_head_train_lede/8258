In a pointed critique of President Trump’s foreign policy leadership, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated to members of the press Thursday that “the American people deserve a president who can more credibly justify war with Iran.” “What the American people need is a president who can make a much more convincing case for going to war with Iran,” said Schumer (D-NY), adding that the Trump administration’s corruption and dishonesty have “proven time and time again” that it lacks the conviction necessary to act as an effective cheerleader for the conflict.
