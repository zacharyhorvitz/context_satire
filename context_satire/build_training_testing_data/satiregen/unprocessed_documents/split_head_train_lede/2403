Following yesterday’s announcement that Amazon.com founder Jeffrey Bezos would be purchasing daily newspaper , sources confirmed today that  associate editor and legendary investigative journalist Bob Woodward had already been repositioned at a new staff position in one of Amazon’s main warehouses just outside of Seattle.Amazon.com sources say that Woodward, who is reportedly now a junior warehouse associate at the web company’s Bellevue-based warehouse, will be primarily responsible for stocking the factory shelves, tracking and packaging online orders, and several other daily tasks related to the location’s inventory.“I know it’s only Bob’s first day, but I think it’s going to take him a little while to get the hang of working here,” said warehouse manager Sam Griffin, who confirmed that the veteran reporter who helped break the Watergate scandal would be making $11.50 an hour at his new position and $12.50 for any weekend or night shifts.
