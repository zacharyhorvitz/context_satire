Explaining that he had made no effort to safeguard the book or even conceal it from sight, sources reported that brazen coffee shop patron Justin Dill left his copy of Vince Flynn’s counterterrorism thriller  completely unattended while using the restroom Friday.Witnesses confirmed that the man—who was reportedly seated at a centrally located table in the Downtown Grounds café in full view of some two dozen other patrons—had been reading for nearly half an hour before closing the book, standing up from his chair, and casually walking away, recklessly leaving the eighth installment of Flynn’s popular Mitch Rapp series alone on the tabletop where anyone could take it.“Wow, I can’t believe he left that book just sitting out there in the open like that,” said fellow customer Robert Green, who explained how he at first believed Dill was stepping away from the espionage novel for only a few moments to retrieve a utensil or napkin from the counter, but was soon left in disbelief upon realizing that the man had brashly ventured to the bathroom, leaving his book out of his sight for several consecutive minutes.
