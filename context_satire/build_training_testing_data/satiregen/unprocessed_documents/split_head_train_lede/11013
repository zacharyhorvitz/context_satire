A team of geologists from the University of Colorado announced at a press conference Wednesday that they had made a significant discovery concerning the world’s silt deposits, but stated that they understand if you aren’t interested in that sort of thing.The consortium of silt experts—who acknowledged that the analysis of the loose sedimentary material that gathers in lakes, rivers, and forests was not necessarily up everyone’s alley—nonetheless stressed that the results of their research had wide-reaching implications for those in their specific field of study.“We’ve made quite a substantial breakthrough in our understanding of how slope stability is impacted by the silt composition in different layers of alluvial soil, but, of course, I’m well aware that isn’t everybody’s thing,” said study director Stephen Powell, who admitted that investigating the movement of silt was, after all, a relatively niche field, so he certainly didn’t begrudge anyone who is not as excited as he is by such research.
