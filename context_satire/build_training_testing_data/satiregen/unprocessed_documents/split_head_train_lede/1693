Describing the vast, undisturbed regions as one of the last true frontiers on the planet, a report published Tuesday by researchers at Cornell University has found that at least 79 percent of the world’s attic space remains unexplored.According to the report, the little-understood lofted areas of most homes across the globe have not been studied beyond a radius of approximately an arm’s length from their entrance hatches, leaving what remains in their further reaches a matter of pure speculation.“Apart from a small region illuminated by a single pull-chain light bulb, we know very little about attics,” said the report’s lead author, professor Neal Hutchison, noting a lack of data on both the size and contents of the elevated enclosures.
