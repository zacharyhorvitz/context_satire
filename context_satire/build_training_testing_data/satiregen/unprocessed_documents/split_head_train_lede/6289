With the private data of national governments and entire global industries at his fingertips, sources confirmed this morning that yet another day had begun with the whole world helplessly at the mercy of 19-year-old Estonian computer hacker Jüri Pevkur.According to reports, as trillions of dollars in financial transactions, thousands of classified military documents, and countless terabytes of personal data are electronically transmitted throughout the course of the day, they will once again be susceptible to viewing and manipulation by the Tallinn University undergraduate, who is presently lying in bed browsing online dating profiles on his iPhone.“I’m happy to announce we’ve finalized a deal to invest £330 million in several startups with significant growth potential,” London-based hedge fund manager Charles Amos said during a morning meeting, apparently unaware that, should Pevkur abandon his plans to spend the afternoon playing  on his Xbox One, the Eastern European coder could easily infiltrate the firm’s private servers and reroute pending monetary transfers to any account of his choosing, just as he can with literally billions of other digital payments taking place across the globe.
