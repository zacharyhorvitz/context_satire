Explaining that such events provide crucial insight into the country’s distribution of wealth, a report issued Friday by the National Bureau of Economic Research reveals that income inequality in the United States is most apparent when attending a fifth-grade classmate’s birthday party.According to the study, a fellow grade schooler’s party contains a range of telling economic indicators, such as the variety of snacks offered, the number of guests the host has been allowed to invite, and the design and luster of wrapping paper used on the gifts from the host’s parents, which are said to provide the most comprehensive and accurate understanding of the widening gap between the nation’s rich and poor.“We found that the extent of economic inequality is most acutely perceived when a fifth-grader arrives to a classmate’s home and takes notice of whether the birthday balloons tied to the mailbox are Mylar and filled with helium or whether they’re just plain latex ones that dangle in a loose bunch,” said lead researcher Julie Kuo, adding that the presence or absence of a vinyl banner suspended above the front door reading “Brandon’s Birthday Zone” further highlights the ongoing concentration of the nation’s wealth in fewer hands.
