Calling it an “exciting new menu item dragged from the darkest reaches of the salty abyss,” executives at seafood restaurant chain Long John Silver’s introduced their latest fast-food offering Thursday, the Golden Fried Abomination From The Deep.The deep-fried ocean beast, which was reportedly subdued by the restaurant’s fishermen following an arduous three-day-long battle in the North Sea that claimed the lives of 80 good men, will be available at participating franchise locations for a limited time only.“We are pleased to offer our guests a taste of the unimaginable horrors that lurk in the briny deep,” said company spokesperson Eric Hutcherson, adding that the nightmarish, slithering mass—whose powerful, iron-like tentacles could snap ships’ masts as though they were so much kindling—is dredged in Long John Silver’s signature batter and cooked until golden brown.
