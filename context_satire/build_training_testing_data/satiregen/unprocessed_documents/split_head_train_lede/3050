Looks like  is going to be even more awesome than we first thought: Nintendo just announced that the sequel to their wildly popular 2015 world-building game will finally give users the ability to construct a synagogue so that Mario can get a Bar Mitzvah.Sure, the originalfor Wii U made fans’ dreams come true by letting them build and share their own Mario-level designs, but one consistent complaint was that it didn’t let gamers build a temple where the world’s most famous plumber could recite his Torah portion and have the mantle of manhood bestowed upon him.Luckily, it sounds like Nintendo has heard fan feedback loud and clear.
