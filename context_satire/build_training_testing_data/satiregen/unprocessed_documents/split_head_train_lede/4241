Stating that the university deserves a boatload of multiculturalism for the investment it’s making, Leverett College officials announced this week that recently admitted minority student Jack Soto better have a pretty goddamn unique perspective if he wants a full scholarship.Administrators for the private liberal arts college confirmed that Soto, who indicated on his application that he is of Burmese descent, needed to single-handedly broaden the worldviews of the student body and create the appearance that the institution was neck-fucking-deep in cross-cultural acceptance in order to be compensated $53,000 a year.“If this guy wants four years of tuition, he’d better enrich the ever-living shit out of campus life,” admissions officer Bryan Collier said on behalf of the financial aid committee, adding that the 17-year-old should speak Burmese or Thai or some other language so Leverett College looked like it was embracing a fuckload of differences.
