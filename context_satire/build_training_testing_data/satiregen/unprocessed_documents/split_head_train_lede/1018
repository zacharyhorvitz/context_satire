According to a new study released this week by George Washington University Professor of Biology Randall Palinack, the pathetic organism in his bathroom mirror—which he observed from approximately 6:04 to 6:09 Monday morning—is “pitiful, just absolutely pitiful.”Based on previous findings, the research took a detailed look at the bipedal sad sack’s anatomy, making note of its receding hairline, distended gut, double chin, and weak facial features that identify it as a highly undesirable mate.“Notice the sedentary mammal’s pear-like body shape, bloodshot eyes, and oily skin, as well as the way its musculature has continued to atrophy over time while the fat deposits around its midsection grow larger and larger,” said the 48-year-old scientist, pinching the specimen’s abdomen firmly while shaking his head in disbelief.
