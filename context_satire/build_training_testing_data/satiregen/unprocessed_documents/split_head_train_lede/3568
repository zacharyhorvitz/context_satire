CEDAR RAPIDS, IAâ€“Dave Willis, 24, a stock boy at Banjo's Food Ranch, was subjected to embarrassment above and beyond the usual humiliation of mopping, shelving, and parking-lot cart-collecting Monday, when he was forced to appear in the supermarket chain's latest in-house training video,  "It's bad enough that when I got hired here, I had to attend a demeaning, afternoon-long orientation session at which I was forced to watch these horrible videos," a visibly dejected Willis told reporters after the dignity-stripping incident.
