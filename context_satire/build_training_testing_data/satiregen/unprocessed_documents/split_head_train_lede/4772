Saying there had to be some sort of logic to the string of grisly murders he had committed over the past seven years, local serial killer Christopher Palley admitted to reporters Friday that he had completely lost track of whatever pattern he had originally been going for.Despite his best efforts to recall the underlying thought or theme that had been the catalyst for his murderous rampage when he took his first victim in 2008, Palley, 44, conceded that he now had “no idea” what the common thread was connecting his killings in terms of motive, choice of victim, or a larger message he wished to communicate to the world.“I feel like I had such a crystal-clear vision of what I was trying to do when I started out, but I just can’t put my finger on it anymore,” said Palley, who even after mentally retracing each of his murders and reading old, clipped-out newspaper accounts of the crimes to jog his memory was no closer to discerning any coherent through-line.
