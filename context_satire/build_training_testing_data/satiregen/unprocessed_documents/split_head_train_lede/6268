Admitting it had stopped counting after the first dozen or so occasions upon which it passed from one fighting force to another, an American-made M4 carbine assault rifle confirmed Wednesday it was losing track of how many times it had switched sides during the ongoing war in Iraq.According to the standard-issue automatic weapon, which was transported to Iraq with the 3rd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army in 2003, it has changed hands so often since arriving in the country that it can no longer remember all the insurgent factions, terrorist organizations, and military groups it belonged to before ISIS took possession of it last month.“I definitely started out with the Americans—I know that—and then I was with the new Iraqi Army for a while, but after that it’s all kind of a blur,” the rifle said of its 13 years of near-continuous use in various military operations, uprisings, and sectarian battles.
