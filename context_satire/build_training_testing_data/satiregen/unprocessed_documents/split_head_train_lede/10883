Reflecting on a life and career in which he has so far not received any prestigious journalism awards, hardworking reporter Peter Chaykin announced this week that he has already gained the most meaningful and glorious prize possible: the undying respect, adoration, and esteem of both his family and his community at large.“Whether I’m shedding light on the struggles of war-torn Africans, or taking time out of my busy workweek to hold my wife and children and tell them I love them, the greatest reward I can imagine is already right here, in my heart,” said Chaykin, who cares little for fancy honors so long as the work he does is good, and his family, friends, and neighbors are happy and safe.“People often say to me, ‘Gosh, Peter, you should really be given some sort of major award for what you do,’ and I just shrug and tell them that, while such an award would be a wonderful thing for my career and the livelihood of my family, I’m already blessed enough as it is.
