In an effort to make the nation a leaner, more dynamic international force, the United States government is reportedly offering 100 million American citizens generous severance deals to leave the country, sources confirmed Wednesday.Government officials told reporters that approximately one in three Americans will receive a comprehensive severance package guaranteeing continued access to federal benefits and full constitutional protections for three months, providing these newly expatriated individuals with the means to support themselves and maintain a first-world quality of life until they secure gainful residence in another country.“In order to effectively position the U.S. to optimally tackle the unique challenges of a changing 21st-century economy, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to trim redundancies among the general population,” President Barack Obama said of the coast-to-coast headcount reduction, which reportedly requires those individuals receiving an exit package to gather their possessions and vacate the country by the end of the week.
