With the summer tourist season now in full gear, officials at Yellowstone National Park expressed a growing sense of concern and agitation Monday about a competing 3,500-square-mile nature reserve that recently opened directly across the street from their own park.According to its detractors, the newly built Yello-Stone Natural Park, draped in strings of multicolored pennant flags and identified by a flashy hand-painted sign, is blatantly attempting to capitalize on the older location’s long-established reputation by offering similar flora, fauna, and geothermal features at a cut-rate price.“That place is absolutely shameless,” Yellowstone superintendent Dan Wenk said.
