With local organizers and attendees hailing the event as a “major success,” the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh wrapped up its 10th annual fashion week Friday, a star-studded international showcase of the latest trends during which 57 women were pelted to death by stones.The glamorous high-fashion event, which debuted the fall couture collections of Calvin Klein, Diane Von Furstenberg, and Anna Sui among others, took place over seven days in the city’s upscale Olaya district and claimed the lives of dozens of models, assistants, and designers, as well as 19 female audience members whose outfits exposed parts of their bodies other than their eyes or hands.“Riyadh Fashion Week is  place to be to check out the newest styles and kill the women wearing them,” said local fruit seller Salman Awad, who claimed that this was his favorite of the six Fashion Weeks he’s attended, as he was able to take out the eye of a model wearing a brocade tunic at Tuesday’s Vivienne Tam show.
