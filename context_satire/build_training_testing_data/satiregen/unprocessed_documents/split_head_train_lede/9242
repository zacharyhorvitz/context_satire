Explaining that his current employment situation is intended merely as a stopgap, local man Simon Goldinger, 23, confirmed Thursday that he only plans to wait tables until the fundamental structure of the American economy undergoes a complete overhaul.Goldinger, who started working as a server at the Whitecap Grill shortly after graduating college last spring, told reporters he took the job in order to make ends meet while he waits for the entire economic framework of the United States to be reorganized at the most basic level, creating a sufficient number of adequately paid opportunities for individuals with his level of education and experience.“I’m not going to be a waiter forever, just until the nation’s job market becomes less reliant on service-sector positions, and a robust, knowledge-based economy can be built from the ground up and given time to flourish, generating more promising career paths that ensure long-term financial stability for members of the workforce like me,” Goldinger said as he scoured several job-listing websites for signs of an unprecedented transformation in the country’s economic foundations.
