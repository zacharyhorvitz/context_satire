Admitting He would not even know what to talk about with His followers after spending two millennia apart, Christ announced Monday that He has called off plans for His return upon coming to the realization that He has been gone so long at this point that coming back “would just be weird.” “I’ve been putting off my return to the vale of tears for centuries, always telling myself I would corporeally appear sometime next year, but I feel like it would just be awkward if I showed up out of the blue,” said the Son of God, expressing concerns that people would be mad at Him for disappearing for such a long time without bothering to send the faithful a message confirming His love or compassion.
