In the wake of yesterday’s devastating tornado that has so far left 24 dead and hundreds injured in the Oklahoma City area, citizens around the country reportedly dredged up what little remained of the nation’s rapidly diminishing grief reserves.According to sources nationwide, the American people, still reeling from a recent spate of horrific tragedies that have included mass shootings, domestic terrorism, and, now, a deadly cyclone, were forced to draw on the very last of their available supplies of grief, leaving them with virtually no remaining provisions of despair and helplessness for the foreseeable future.“The American people had been running on scant grief supplies for a number of weeks, and unfortunately it seems as though yesterday’s tragedy in Oklahoma City has just about tapped them out,” said noted sociologist Dr. Martin Hanlon, who claimed that the nation’s despair cache was running perilously low even before the arrival of Monday’s tornado, which has so far displaced thousands of people, destroyed countless homes, and killed several schoolchildren.
