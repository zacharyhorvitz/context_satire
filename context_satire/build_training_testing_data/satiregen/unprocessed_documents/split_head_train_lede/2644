Retail giant Wal-Mart has announced in recent weeks that, effective immediately, it is cutting as many as 13,000 of what it somehow has the audacity to refer to as "jobs" from its corporate payroll.According to Wal-Mart representatives, the, for lack of a better word, positions will be cut from the company's underperforming Sam's Club division.
