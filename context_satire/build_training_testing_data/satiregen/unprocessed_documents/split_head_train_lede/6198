Nervously checking his watch and glancing around the desolate underground parking garage in anticipation,  host Matt Lauer was reportedly waiting for an anonymous source with inside knowledge of the latest parenting trends during the early morning hours Thursday.Reports indicate that Lauer had planned a secret meeting at 2 a.m. with his unidentified parenting source in the lowest level of a parking facility on East 50th Street, where on several previous occasions he had received classified information on half-birthday parties, breastfeeding selfies, and multilingual nannies.“She’s late,” said Lauer, looking around the dimly lit garage for the anonymous informant known only by the pseudonym “Crafty Mom,” who had reportedly provided him with vital details about sneaking vegetables into a child’s diet by encouraging them to use peppers and tomato slices to make their own smiley-face miniature pizzas.
