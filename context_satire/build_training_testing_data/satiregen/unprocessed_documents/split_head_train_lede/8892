Calling the teen’s behavior “ruthless” and “out of control,” Oscar-winning actress Anne Hathaway confirmed to reporters today that for the past few months she has been routinely and viciously bullied both in person and across a wide variety of social media by 14-year-old Jenny Schroeder.According to Hathaway, the “incredibly mean” eighth-grader has targeted the Hollywood leading lady specifically with increasingly brazen acts of cruelty, including posting threatening messages on the 30-year-old’s Facebook page and making numerous disparaging remarks about Hathaway’s physical appearance, often uttered directly to her or within earshot of her.“At first it was just super mean comments when she’d pass by me, like, ‘Hey, loser,’ but it’s gotten way, way worse—it’s a nightmare,” said Hathaway, adding that Schroeder is currently waging a war against Hathaway on social media sites Formspring.me, The Dirty, Kik, and Askfm, where the girl’s messages ranged from mocking the actress’ outfits to encouraging her to take her own life.
