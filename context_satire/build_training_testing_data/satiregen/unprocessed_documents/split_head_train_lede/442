According to a groundbreaking report released this week by researchers at the University of Texas, tens of millions of citizens across the United States are bravely resisting the relentless pressure from the media to be thin and active.The 80-page report confirmed that Americans are inundated with images of slender individuals in commercials, films, television shows, print advertisements, billboards, internet ads, and product packaging every day, yet noted that as many as 190 million citizens are “courageously refusing to conform” to these media ideals of physical fitness and leanness and are instead embracing the bodies they have.“Given the media’s clear preference for thin physiques, we expected most Americans would be actively seeking to emulate such body types, but we found that nearly 7 in 10 American adults possess the inner courage and determination to overcome the constant pressure to maintain a trim figure,” said behavioral psychologist and the report’s co-author Olivia Trumbull, noting that these Americans boldly ignored, on average, 10 to 14 images of in-shape individuals every minute of the day.
