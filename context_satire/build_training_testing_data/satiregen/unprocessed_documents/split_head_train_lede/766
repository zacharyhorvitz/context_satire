In an official ceremony held at the Justice Department Monday, ventriloquist Willie Tyler and his dummy, Lester, strongly condemned Una-bomber suspect Theodore Ka-czynski.The news media, Clinton administration officials, FBI agents and numerous family members of Unabomber victims were present to observe the somber public censure, which took place as part of a double header with former Phyllis Diller joke-writer Mel Habusch.In his first set, Tyler called the terrorist acts of the Unabomber “cold, senseless acts of terror, which wrought tragedy upon the entire nation.”Tyler then turned to Lester to ask his opinion.“Lester,” he said, “Do you think the Unabomber is a cold, senseless killer?”“He is indeed,” Lester said.
