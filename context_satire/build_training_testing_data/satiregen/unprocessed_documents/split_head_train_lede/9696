Explaining that the larger containment center was necessary to keep up with increased demand, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced Thursday the completion of a new suspension tank that will allow the online retailer to house even more of the psychic beings who foresee each shopper’s future orders.The glass-walled vat reportedly takes up five stories of a building in Amazon’s downtown Seattle campus and holds 750,000 gallons of the psychoactive nutrient fluid necessary to sustain the 256 pale, hairless humanoids who, every day, predict the online purchases of millions of consumers across the world.“This facility will allow us to double our population of clairvoyants, which means we will receive more prophecies of orders we can then ship to people who don’t even know they want them yet,” said Bezos, noting that the completely silent, temperature-controlled tank will keep the beings comfortable and focused as they foretell 10,000 individualized orders for razor blade cartridges per second.
