Facing an unending string of emotional, verbal, and physical abuses from his peers, sources confirmed Monday that local youth Nathan Meserole is reportedly having considerable difficulty fitting in at his home.According to individuals close to the unpopular 14-year-old, Meserole is roundly rejected and ostracized by the other members of his household, mistreatment that regularly escalates into a cycle of mocking and harassment that has, over time, left the teenager in constant fear of what new humiliations await him each new day at home.“Nathan is an introverted, socially awkward young boy, and the other children at his home constantly prey on him because of this,” said guidance counselor Marlene Spencer, who noted that Nathan clearly dreads spending hours at home every day.
