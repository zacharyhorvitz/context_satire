A routine Schaeffer family movie night took a sudden and deeply uncomfortable turn Thursday when the family of four was forced to white-knuckle its way through an unanticipated sex scene, household sources confirmed.According to reports, an intense awkwardness descended upon the Schaeffers’ living room when, approximately 75 minutes into a PG-13 action-adventure thriller they had been enjoying, a brief scene of sexual content appeared, leaving the parents and their two school-age children with no choice but to sit there together and plow through it.“Ahem…” said father Stan Schaeffer, 46, clearing his throat after the film’s hero pulled his love interest in close for a long, tender kiss, which reportedly made the family members agonizingly aware of each other’s breathing and proximity, abruptly ending the carefree mood of what had until then been a relaxing evening.
