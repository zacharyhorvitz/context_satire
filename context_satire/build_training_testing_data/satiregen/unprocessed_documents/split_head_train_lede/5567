A team of British and Egyptian archaeologists made a stunning discovery Monday, unearthing several intact specimens of “skeleton people”—skinless, organless humans who populated the Nile delta region an estimated 6,000 years ago.“This is an incredible find,” said Dr. Christian Hutchins, Oxford University archaeologist and head of the dig team.
