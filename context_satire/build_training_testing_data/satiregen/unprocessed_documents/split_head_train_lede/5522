Sources are confirming that the Central Intelligence Agency has orchestrated a coup d’état in the South American nation of Venezuela, toppling the country’s 30 million residents and replacing them with an entirely new, pro-American populace.According to high-ranking federal officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, the CIA-backed citizens were installed in the early morning hours Thursday shortly after the sitting population was captured and forcibly removed from the country, part of a strategic plan to end political instability in Venezuela and ensure every single inhabitant of the nation is sympathetic to U.S. interests.“Reports we’re hearing from those on the ground indicate all residential households in Venezuela are now occupied by pro-American surrogates,” said Angela Zarush, a Brussels-based foreign policy analyst who described the millions of new Venezuelans as “puppet citizens” handpicked by U.S. intelligence agents.
