Marking a major breakthrough in the study of highly charged atmospheres and intense fields of emotional instability, scientists at Stanford University announced Thursday they had synthesized an entirely new and extremely volatile form of romantic relationship.According to project head Dr. Stuart Barnard, this highly combustible pairing was created by taking two wildly incompatible people—24-year-old test subjects Colin Buckner and Lisa Mullins—and then rapidly colliding their personalities together until they briefly formed an unstable bond.“Our experiment succeeded beyond our wildest expectations,” said Barnard, noting that all prior evidence suggested Buckner and Mullins were completely wrong for each other and should never be together.
