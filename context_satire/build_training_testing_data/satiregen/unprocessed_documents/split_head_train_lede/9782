The United States of America signed Dunkin’ Donuts to a 10-year deal Wednesday naming the doughnut company and coffeehouse as the exclusive food vendor of the U.S. “We’re proud and excited to welcome the United States to the Dunkin’ family by agreeing to be their one and only source of nourishment through 2028,” CEO Nigel Travis said of the $80 trillion contract between Dunkin’ Brands and the U.S. Congress, which guarantees the fast-food coffeehouse chain the sole right to provide foodstuffs to restaurants, grocery stores, school cafeterias, and millions of other provisioning and dining establishments across the country.
