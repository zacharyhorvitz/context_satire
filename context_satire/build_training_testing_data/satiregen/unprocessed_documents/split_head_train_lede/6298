In what is being hailed as a potential game-changer for the beleaguered automotive giant, General Motors announced Thursday that it plans to pour all its resources into a single car that can be safely driven down the street, turned around, and then driven back.According to CEO Mary Barra, GM will harness every means at its disposal—from its $155 billion in annual revenue to its 219,000 employees working in 396 facilities around the world—to produce one Chevrolet Function: a four-door sedan that will be made available to a single customer wishing to complete a trip around a residential block without sustaining any bodily harm.“We’re excited to be investing everything we have in this promising new direction for GM, which will allow tomorrow’s driver to navigate a stretch of road in a vehicle that remains physically in one piece throughout the trip,” Barra said at a press conference, standing before an in-progress model of the car that she confirmed is now the sole focus of GM’s entire 2,000-person design team.
