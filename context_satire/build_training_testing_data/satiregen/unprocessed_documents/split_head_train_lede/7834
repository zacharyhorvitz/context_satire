In a custom that is said to be as old as the digital marketing agency itself, staff members of Thorpe Media listened in rapt fixation Wednesday to an oration of the epic saga of Doug Plasky, a company account manager whose tales of legendary ineptitude have been handed down through generations of coworkers.Speaking one by one within the hallowed meeting grounds of Hanny’s Bar and Grill, company elders recited the sprawling, storied lore of Plasky’s incompetence, regaling the firm’s newest hires well past the setting of the spring sun and the end of happy hour specials.“Gather round, fellow coworkers, and hear the legend of the one who is known o’er the entire fifth floor as the most incapable man ever to grace the client services department,” said product manager Brad Idstein, playing the bard whilst basked in the dim glow of the sports bar’s lighting.
