Struggling to fathom why no one has yet claimed the perfectly good piece of furniture, local man Adam Ellery told reporters Wednesday that a free couch has been sitting on the curb near his apartment for months.The couch, a 6-foot-long settee made of solid redwood drilled into cast-iron supports, has reportedly remained out on the pavement since Ellery moved to the neighborhood nearly a year ago.“I can’t believe no one’s snagged it yet,” said Ellery, observing that the couch is in solid shape and appears to have no major damage or stains.
