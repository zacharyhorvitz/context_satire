According to a study published Tuesday in , researchers at Johns Hopkins University have succeeded in conclusively linking everyone and everything everywhere to paranoia.The comprehensive 11-month study—which was designed to establish that it’s all tied to paranoia, all of it, and absolutely everyone is in on it—was able to connect extreme cases of paranoid behavior with the government, the media, doctors, Palestine, the meat industry, stoplights, and everything in existence, all working together, conspiring against us.“Our research shows statistically significant correlations between episodes of paranoia and fast food chains,  magazine, the growing military-industrial-media complex that holds all Americans hostage, honeybees, my mother, and China,” said an unshaven, disheveled Dr. Adam Crane, lead author of the paper.
