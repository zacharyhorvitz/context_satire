Citing such examples as his understated eye rolls or how he often delivers a faint, judgment-filled “hmm” after an employee passionately presents an idea, workers at Blain Insurance, Ltd. told reporters Tuesday that general manager Carl Douglas, 44, has a special, subtle knack for making members of his staff feel like utter dog shit.Calling his unique, minimalist approach to destroying their self-esteem “impressive,” employees said their boss is just as adept at insulting a single worker with a few well-placed sarcastic remarks as he is at humiliating his entire staff at once.“He’s got this really light touch about it,” said mortgage underwriter Kevin McElroy, 29, who praised his manager’s delicate, finely honed talent for demeaning others.
