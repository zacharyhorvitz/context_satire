While suffering an unexpected nervous breakdown Thursday morning, local woman Alyssa Mullen reportedly admitted to her 5-year-old son that she “just doesn’t know who [she is] anymore, little buddy.” “I’m trying my best to remember what the point of all this is, kiddo, but I’m really having a hard time of it,” Mullen told her son Jacob, moments after watching a mug of coffee slip out of her hands and shatter on the kitchen floor.
