Saying the space would offer a laid-back atmosphere and a variety of fun activities for young people, 31-year-old local youth pastor Marc Kindler told reporters Thursday the new rec room at Grace United Church of Christ has everything a teenager could want.As he pointed out a collection of two dozen DVDs and Blu-rays, a board game shelf, and a kitchenette where several types of potato chips and other snacks are available, Kindler remarked that the 800-square-foot basement facility is filled with “all the stuff” kids love, and predicted it would be a big hit with 13- to 18-year-old members of the congregation.“We pretty much have it all down here,” said Kindler, gesturing around the room that was until recently the church’s primary storage space, and which he has decorated with inspirational prints and several posters of Ohio sports teams.
