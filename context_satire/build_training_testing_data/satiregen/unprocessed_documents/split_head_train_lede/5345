In a scathing attack on the very foundations of democracy and everything the United States stands for, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) disrespectfully referred Monday to America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, as “a place.” “It’s unconscionable to think that this so-called American would use a vile term like ‘place’ to describe the shining city upon a hill without so much as mentioning its spacious skies or amber waves of grain,” said Maryland resident Greg Blankford, echoing the sentiments of the 327 million patriots condemning the freshman congresswoman’s characterization of the nation as “a location” as anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and anti-American.
