Two years after making the decision to quit drinking once and for all, local man and recovering alcoholic Julian Bradford, 35, told reporters Monday he now realizes that he doesn’t need friends to have a good time.“For so long, I thought that hanging out with my friends was the only way for me to have any fun, but it turns out I can have just as great a time without them,” said Bradford, who according to sources hasn’t had a drink or a night out with his buddies since 2012.
