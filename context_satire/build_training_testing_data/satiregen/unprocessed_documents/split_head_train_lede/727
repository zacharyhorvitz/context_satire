Officials at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration called an emergency press conference Monday to urge all Americans to check out a really weird-looking potato.The half-pound russet potato— discovered last night in a Maryland supermarket by an FDA agent who was grocery shopping—is being described as "two potatoes that sort of got fused together somehow, but with some other really weird parts growing off of it."
