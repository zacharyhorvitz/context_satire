In preparation for tonight’s third and final presidential debate, the microbiologists, chemists, and physicists employed at RomneyLabs confirmed Monday that they had completed their work on the “Doomsday Zinger,” an extremely radioactive quip capable of shifting the momentum of any debate, regardless of who is winning.According to an official statement released by RomneyLabs—a 19,000-square-foot research facility located in the hills of Belmont, MA and dedicated to nuclear campaign science—lab technicians have been hard at work devising the Doomsday Zinger for the past four years, and it will be “the most decisive and catastrophic zinger” ever used against President Barack Obama.If verbal launch is successful, sources said, the one-liner could eradicate the entire Obama campaign in .03 seconds.“During Mr. Romney’s run for the White House, our researchers have developed more than 200,000 zingers in the hopes of crafting a single one-liner capable of leveling President Obama’s reelection bid,” RomneyLabs head Dr. Marcus Fowler said from the facility’s Treatment and Enrichment Center, which consists of more than 100 centrifuges constantly spinning highly volatile zinger components, such as unstable economic numbers, fluctuating housing data, tritium, and failed immigration legislation.
