Admitting that his affection for their gauche and boorish ways had surprised even himself, prominent socialite J. Thomas Donelan III confirmed Wednesday that he was falling for the nation’s unrefined but beautiful lower classes.Donelan, an industrialist and avid patron of the arts whose net worth is estimated at $8.6 billion, told reporters that while at first he was repulsed by lower-income Americans’ fashion sense, eating habits, speech, and pedestrian interests, their simple charms had gradually turned his disdain into fondness, and then, finally, into something closer to love.“For a long time, I looked down on ordinary people, with their uncultivated tastes for malt beverages and stock car racing, but one day, something about them just caught my eye,” Donelan said as he recalled an incident not long ago when his chauffeur took a wrong exit off the freeway, accidentally driving the 59-year-old heir through a working-class neighborhood he had never seen before, where he was reportedly taken aback by the humble beauty underneath residents’ Quiznos uniforms and Juicy Couture sweatpants.
