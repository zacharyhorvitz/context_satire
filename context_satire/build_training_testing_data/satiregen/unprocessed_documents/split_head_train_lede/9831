Saying they were working diligently to address the problem, Walt Disney World officials acknowledged Wednesday that several dozen unauthorized characters, none of which have ever appeared in a Disney film or cartoon, had been found in recent weeks wandering throughout the theme park.Company sources confirmed that at least 60 separate individuals in costumes, including various woodland creatures, several fairies, and what officials described as a walrus in a lab coat, have been spotted greeting visitors, hugging children, posing for pictures, and meandering into daily parades alongside sanctioned Disney characters.“I want to assure Disney World visitors that these unaffiliated characters are being rounded up as we speak and removed from the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Disney’s Hollywood Studios,” said company spokesperson Wesley Aldridge, noting that patrons may still encounter certain individuals wearing ox costumes, Belgian peasant girl costumes, or any number of other unfamiliar outfits for the time being.
