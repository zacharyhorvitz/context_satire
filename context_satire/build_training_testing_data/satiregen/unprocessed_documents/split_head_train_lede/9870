Touting them as the next stage in modernized combat, representatives for the United States military unveiled today a new line of bionically enhanced “super-soldiers,” capable of withstanding the enormous mental toll of war.Commanders introduced the next-generation, biologically modified troops at a press conference in Washington, telling reporters that the elite military personnel have been engineered to mentally withstand limitless amounts of violence and bloodshed on the battlefield, which would then prevent them from experiencing future bouts of paranoia, anxiety, and crippling depression.“Today we embark upon an exciting new frontier in 21st-century warfare,” said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey, standing beside a tightly formed platoon of the augmented soldiers, whom the four-star general described as “impervious” to ever feeling on-edge or completely numb to the world.
