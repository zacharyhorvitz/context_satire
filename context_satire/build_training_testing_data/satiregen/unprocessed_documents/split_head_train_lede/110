Campaign sources expressed concern today over Mitt Romney’s green complexion, papery skin, and slowly flattening body frame, prompting increased speculation that the Republican presidential candidate has been gradually transforming into a $100 bill.Staff members said the Republican candidate—whose skin pigmentation has now been fully overtaken by optically variable ink and whose spinal column has slowly shifted into an outline of Philadelphia’s Independence Hall—has been undergoing the transformation throughout the campaign and now more closely resembles a banknote than a human being.“When Mitt’s skin began changing, everyone was worried he was suffering from some sort of strange health condition,” said an anonymous Romney staffer, who went on to describe the loud crinkling noises the candidate now makes whenever he walks, and the potent smell of paper stock that has overwhelmed campaign headquarters since mid-April.
