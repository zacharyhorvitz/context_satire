Residents of Worcester’s Grafton Hill neighborhood acknowledged Monday they would not necessarily mind a Panera Bread franchise coming in and wiping out Callahan’s, a charming, family-run bakery that has been a fixture of their community since 1964.According to locals, the national restaurant chain would be just the thing to run the mom-and-pop establishment out of business, replacing Callahan’s genuinely warm, welcoming atmosphere with the kind of impersonal, hassle-free cafe experience they have long desired.“Callahan’s really is lovely and all, but every time I’m in there I get roped into a 10-minute conversation about what’s going on in the neighborhood, or the history of some recipe that’s been in their family for generations,” said patron Catherine New, 33, who told reporters the friendly older couple who owns the shop is always there, apparently working from open to close every single day.
