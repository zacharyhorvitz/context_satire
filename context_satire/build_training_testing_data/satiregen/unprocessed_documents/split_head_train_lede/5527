Admiring his rapid advancement from a junior sales position to a management role in an unprecedented six months, sources at Forge Media said Monday that coworker Mark Pisciotto’s meteoric rise through the company is a true testament to its high turnover rate.Since joining the digital marketing firm last October as a sales associate, Pisciotto, 28, has been successively promoted to client service manager, team leader, and director of client service, a swift ascent that office sources said stood as impressive proof of the large number of vacancies at their workplace.“If you look at where he started compared to where he is now, you can’t help but think, ‘Wow, a whole lot of people have been leaving,’” said Forge HR director Caroline Moser, marveling at just how much Pisciotto had benefitted from the departure of colleagues in such a short time.
