Hoping to raise awareness of a frequently stigmatized and misunderstood issue, experts at Stanford Medical School’s Department of Psychiatry And Behavioral Sciences concluded Friday that the earliest warning signs of declining mental health usually include a compulsion to cross one’s eyes while dribbling a finger across one’s lips and repeating “cuckoo, cuckoo.” “We have found that most people aren’t immediately able to spot these symptoms in their friends and loved ones, so it’s important we inform people of these precursors to the most common mental disorders,” said Dr. Victoria Perez, who noted that early warning signs also include the wearing of underwear upon the head, the flapping of the arms in the manner of a chicken’s wings, and the insertion of one hand horizontally into one’s shirt while insisting that one is, in fact, the Emperor Napoleon.
