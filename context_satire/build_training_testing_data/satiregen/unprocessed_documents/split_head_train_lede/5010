According to unnerved sources, the donut shop at the corner of Belmont Avenue and Clark Street gets really weird after 11 a.m. "Up until about 10, it's totally normal, but sometime after that, you start seeing more and more people with gauze taped over one eye, and there generally seems to be a lot more canesâ€”sometimes just leaning up against tables or hanging off the backs of empty chairs without it really being clear who owns them," retail associate Jake Kleibesadel told reporters Thursday, explaining he occasionally stops into the establishment for a quick snack during work breaks.
