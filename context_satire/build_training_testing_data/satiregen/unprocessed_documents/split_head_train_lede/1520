In response to a probe into the bureau’s operational costs, FBI director Robert Mueller timidly told Congress Wednesday that the organization he oversees has not technically solved any crimes since 2001.After confirming that the FBI does indeed have more than 13,000 special agents deployed to investigate cases all across the country, Mueller stressed that the bureau’s internal process was “complicated,” and that the fact that not one case file has been closed in the past decade is not unexpected.According to records, the last case the FBI officially solved was a Topeka, KS mail fraud offense in February 2001.“It’s hard to explain to a layman precisely how our operations work, but it’s really more about analyzing crimes than it is about actually, you know, arresting perpetrators and convicting them,” a fidgeting Mueller said.
