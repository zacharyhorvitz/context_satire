Reflecting wistfully on what he might have made of himself had he chosen a different profession, Dynatrend Solutions network engineer Alan Miller said Wednesday that he would be a systems manager if he had the chance to go back and do it all over again.Despite a long and successful career of identifying and solving network-infrastructure-based problems, the 47-year-old told reporters there will always be a little part of him that regrets not having instead followed his youthful ambition of designing technology solutions as a systems manager.“If I could tell my younger self one thing, it would be to go with your gut and take a shot with systems management, because if you don’t, you’re always going to wonder what might have been,” said Miller, who by his mid-20s had established himself as a network engineer, passing up the prospect of a more fun and rewarding career as a systems manager.
