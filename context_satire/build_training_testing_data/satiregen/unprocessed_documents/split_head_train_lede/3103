 After nearly four years without a major live show, alternative rock band Sugar Ray announced Monday that they were "thrilled beyond words" to be playing inside San Diego resident Robert Waldie's head.The impromptu concert, which took place between Waldie's temporal lobes early Monday afternoon, was the largest venue Sugar Ray had played since 2001's Surf's Up Festival in Los Angeles.
