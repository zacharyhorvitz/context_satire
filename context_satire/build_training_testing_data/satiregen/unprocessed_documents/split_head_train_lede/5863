Signaling an alarming and dangerous trend for the nation’s motorists, the U.S. Department of Transportation released a report Friday revealing that four out of five traffic accidents are caused by drivers taking their eyes off the road to ogle shirtless hunks.The report confirmed that in 2013, more than 7 million passenger cars and light trucks were involved in minor collisions, rollovers, and multi-vehicle accidents that resulted from drivers who were distracted by checking out the taut and tanned muscles of gorgeous young studs.“Our data indicates that gawking at the washboard abs of a grade-A beefcake jogging on the sidewalk, even for just a few seconds, dramatically increases the likelihood of driver error and crash risk,” said DOT spokesperson Hugh Tucker, noting that looking in the side mirror for another quick peek at a smoking hot landscaper wiping sweat from his brow was the country’s leading cause of rear-end crashes.
