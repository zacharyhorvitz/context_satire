Speaking to reporters after traveling to the Muslim holy city of Mecca and completing his five-day hajj pilgrimage, 38-year-old Toronto resident Imad Marikh expressed his surprise and disappointment Wednesday that he didn’t find the experience to be more transformative.Marikh, a lifelong Muslim of Moroccan descent, told reporters he made the 6,500-mile holy journey with the hope that he would forge a deeper connection with God, but confessed that, despite performing the required rituals as faithfully as he could, he failed to undergo the “whole cathartic religious enlightenment thing” common for many others who fulfill the fifth pillar of Islam.“I’m happy I was able to take part in such a revered tradition of my religion, but to be totally honest, I guess I thought it was going to be a bigger deal or something,” said Marikh, adding that he had always been eager to complete his religious duty to visit Mecca, but noted that, for him personally, the trip had been “kind of a letdown, actually.” “Before I came out here, all I ever heard was, ‘Mecca will completely change you as a person’ and ‘Becoming a hajji will bring you closer to Allah than you could ever imagine.’ Gotta say, though, that never really happened for me.
