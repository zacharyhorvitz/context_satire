A new report released Wednesday by a privately funded think tank revealed that local receptionist Amanda Berley, 31, has the best friends in the whole world.The report, which compared Berley’s friends to a wide sampling of similar groups across multiple demographics, found the women to be superior in all aspects of friendship, including going out for cocktails after work, telling someone they are too good for that asshole anyway, and remembering birthdays even if the person didn’t want to make a big deal out of it.“After months of intensive analysis, we can now determine conclusively that Amanda Berley’s friends are indeed the greatest in the world,” said Stephen Reynolds, spokesperson for the Fielding Institute.
