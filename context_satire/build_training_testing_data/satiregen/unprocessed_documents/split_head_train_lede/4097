In the wake of the terrorist attacks in Brussels that left over 30 dead and more than 100 injured, an angry and frustrated global populace collectively announced Tuesday that it would make one last attempt to try to understand this shit.Visibly exasperated residents from every country around the world told reporters that, after enduring so much similarly horrific shit in recent years, they would give comprehending barbaric acts of violence against innocent civilians and the intensely complex network of factors that motivate them “one more shot” before simply throwing their hands up and giving up entirely.“Okay, this is it—I swear to God this is the last time I’m going to sit here and try to make some sense of why these things keep happening, why these people are so angry, and what, if anything, we can possibly do to stop them,” said 48-year-old Medford, OR resident Adam Bennett, taking a deep breath and steeling himself for one last effort to gain some insight into this fucking horrible shit.
