Smiling and offering commentary throughout the visit, local employee Jason Aldrich reportedly brought his 7-year-old son to his office Tuesday, giving the young boy a chance to see where his dad is humiliated and stripped of his manhood on a daily basis.According to several eyewitnesses, the 39-year-old sales associate provided his son Tyler with a tour of Newmar Logistics company headquarters, showing him everything from the conference room where his ideas are routinely ignored to the break room where he has occasionally overheard coworkers talking behind his back about how hopelessly ineffectual he is.“This is where daddy sits every day, right here at this desk,” Aldrich said of the cubicle where he is often seen working late as he struggles to complete assignments that have been passed off onto him by colleagues whom he lacks the courage to even try saying no to anymore.
