More than 70 years after the opening of the first McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast food hamburger chain announced Thursday it may soon begin franchising its restaurants, which until now have always been wholly owned and operated by the McDonald family.Allowing outside franchisees to start up their own McDonald’s restaurants would reportedly mark a sharp departure for the company, which since its founding has exclusively employed blood relatives and in-laws of the McDonald family, both at its corporate offices and at each of its 34,000 locations worldwide.“For nearly three quarters of a century, every time someone has walked into one of our restaurants, their order has been rung up by a McDonald,” said company spokesman Doug McDonald, noting that he, along with each of his siblings and cousins, grew up in the family business and has remained with it ever since.
