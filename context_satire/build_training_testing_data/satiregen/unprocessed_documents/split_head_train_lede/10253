Top officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration unveiled plans this week for a comprehensive, multibillion-dollar delayâ€”the agency's most ambitious postponement of cosmic exploration ever.The unprecedented delay has reportedly brought together the nation's foremost aerospace engineers, whose combined efforts have already added 18 months of rescheduled meetings to the daring mission.While he could not lock down any specifics regarding completion dates or construction deadlines, NASA associate administrator Christopher Scolese said this latest endeavor will be on a scale and time frame greater than anything the agency has attempted to put off before.
