A report released Tuesday by a team of researchers at the Brookings Institution has confirmed that the United States currently has enough chairs and there is no urgent need to produce new ones.Representing a five-year inquiry into the nation’s seating availability and quality, the 85-page study of American homes, offices, dining establishments, public spaces, and patios has determined that, for now, the nation has “plenty” of chairs and can get by just fine with the chairs it already possesses.“Through rigorous observation and analysis, we have verified that there is absolutely no shortage of chairs at this time,” said the report’s lead author, Simon Clouse, noting that in addition to wooden chairs and plastic chairs, there are also enough cushy, upholstered chairs.
