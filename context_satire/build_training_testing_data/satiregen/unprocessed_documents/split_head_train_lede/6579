In a turn of events sources described as “completely coincidental in every way,” the new intern at the consulting firm Marcus, McMahon, and Grieg, in addition to being the most qualified candidate for the position, also just happens be a gorgeous 22-year-old woman, reports confirmed Tuesday.“She’s a real gem—smart as a whip, and so full of energy and life,” consultant James Pratt said of Melody Kestrel, who was selected for the yearlong internship at the upscale midtown Manhattan firm and who follows in the footsteps of four equally stunning, but also uniquely qualified, young women to hold the position since 2008.
