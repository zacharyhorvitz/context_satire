In a historic decree proclaiming the time had come for blood to be shed upon every corner of the Earth and for each enemy to be pursued unto death, the Pentagon declared Thursday that it would consolidate all the nation’s wars, from now until the end of days, into one final, epic battle.As they stood beneath a darkened sky and looked out over the windswept plain upon which they had amassed the full might of their armored vehicles, combat aircraft, drones, and 2 million service members, U.S. military commanders confirmed they were ready to mobilize every asset at their disposal for one last global campaign: an unceasing battle that will continue until every potential American adversary has been defeated.“Soon, we will confront our enemies—every last one of them—in a single, glorious clash of arms through which we intend to settle America’s scores once and for all,” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford shouted to the assembled ranks of all five branches of the military, ordering officers to deploy every troop under their command and every weapon in their arsenals to all seven continents.
