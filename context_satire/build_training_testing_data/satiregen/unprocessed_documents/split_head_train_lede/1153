After rereading actor Matt Damon’s Wikipedia page for the 13th time since 9 a.m. today, local man Dan Easter decided to look up the celebrity’s home address on Google because, well, he’s admittedly crazy and wants to murder him.Saying he planned to “just click around” a couple websites to see if the  star’s address was listed anywhere on the Internet, Easter told reporters that, you know, he’s ultimately a mentally ill madman who wants to break into Matt Damon’s house in the dead of night and, you guessed it, kill him in front of his wife and children.“I figured I would just type Matt Damon’s name into Google because, to make a long story short, I’m psychologically disturbed and I want to assassinate him,” said the 29-year-old man, who, by his own admission, is extremely unstable and has absolutely no business being anywhere other than a mental institution.
