According to neighbors living near local French bulldog Ruggles, the humiliation-loving canine apparently derives intense pleasure from being stark naked, clipped to a movement-constricting leash, and paraded around in public.Witnesses say that Ruggles, who is reportedly totally shameless about his demented, anything-goes lifestyle, seemingly takes some sort of twisted glee in wearing a thick harness and walking around on all fours while being fully subdued by his owner, 34-year-old Brian Paulson.“Just look at that depraved freak,” said astonished neighbor Stacey Hampton, watching the nude animal fully hunched over and debasing himself by following Paulson’s patronizing commands to “come,” “sit,” and “stay.” “Every afternoon they’re at it again, playing this sadistic little game where Brian is the master and Ruggles is his slave or something—in broad daylight no less!”“And at the park, too, in front of dozens of people,” Hampton continued.
