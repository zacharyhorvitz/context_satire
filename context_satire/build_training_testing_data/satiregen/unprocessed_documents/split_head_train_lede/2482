Citing decades of repeated indignities and post-electoral trauma, Americans from across the political spectrum reported Wednesday that they were terrified at the prospect of making their voices heard in another nationwide vote.The U.S. electorate, whose choices on Nov. 4 will determine who occupies 36 spots in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives, expressed a looming sense of dread that no matter what the outcome of their actions, it would be a cruel and degrading experience with painful repercussions—just as it’s been year after year after year.“When Americans go to the polls on Election Day, they will once again be in a state of abject fear, knowing exactly what kind of excruciating ordeal they’re in for,” said Paula McDermott, a professor at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, adding that voters were not so much willing participants in the electoral process as they were victims trapped in an endless cycle of abuse.
