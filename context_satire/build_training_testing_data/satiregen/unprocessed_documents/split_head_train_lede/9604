Former world heavyweight boxing champ Muhammad Ali spoke out Monday against what he called “the ever-growing threat of thermonuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.”  Ali, speaking from his Louisville home, made a personal appeal to Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev to settle their differences at the discussion table, not on the field of battle.
