Sources confirmed Tuesday the comic book and sci-fi expo Comic-Con was once again tarnished by the presence of the increasingly popular Bully-Con, a brutal event held simultaneously in the same convention space and attended by some of the nation’s most die-hard fans of pummeling nerds.Now in its fifth year, Bully-Con reportedly drew more than 125,000 tormentors of all stripes to the San Diego Convention Center, many of whom said that for people really into making life miserable for those weaker than themselves, there was nothing quite like the massive four-day gathering.“I don’t necessarily have to travel to San Diego to slap a copy of  out of some pussy’s hands, but there’s something special about coming together with thousands of people who really dig the same sort of cruelty you do,” said Houston-area goon Marty Badolato, adding that he quickly made half a dozen new friends while shoving people exiting a Q&A with  creator Ben Edlund.
