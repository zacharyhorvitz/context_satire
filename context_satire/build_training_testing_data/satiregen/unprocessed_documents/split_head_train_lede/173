Saying they were glad to accept consolation wherever they could find it, violence-weary Americans told reporters this week they were going to go ahead and take comfort in the fact that there hasn’t recently been a news story about a person killing and eating another person.A broad spectrum of citizens from across the nation stated that with everything else going on in the world today, at least it’s been quite some time since they’ve opened up a newspaper and read about a deranged psychopath murdering and cannibalizing one or more strangers, coworkers, or family members, noting that the current absence of such an event is something they’ll readily take solace in.“I have to say, it feels pretty good to have gone a while without seeing any TV news reports from a backyard crime scene where police are digging up half-eaten corpses,” said New Ulm, MN resident Ethan Rhodus, who along with many other Americans confirmed he hasn’t read a headline or watched a news magazine program’s investigation about anything like that lately.
