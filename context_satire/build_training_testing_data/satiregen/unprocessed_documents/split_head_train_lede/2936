Finally unhindered by his wife Tipper’s 25-year-long household ban on violent and sexually explicit music, former vice president Al Gore, 62, reportedly embraced his newfound independence this week by listening to the albums of the heavy metal band W.A.S.P.“For the first time in decades, I get to play the kind of music I like without someone nagging me about what a bad influence it is,” said Gore, sitting on the floor of his living room as he cued up the song “Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)“ on his stereo.
