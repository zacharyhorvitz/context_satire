Shocked and saddened witnesses at the 's news-aggregation facility have confirmed that employee Henry Evers, 25, died Wednesday after being sucked into the website's powerful news-repurposing turbine, where his body was immediately torn to pieces.The 200-ton content-compiling device, developed by Greek multimillionaire and site co-founder AriÂ­anna Huffington, sucks up original articles from around the web with its massive rotor assembly, re-brands them with the  name, and then spits them back out on the company's home page.Workers said that when the machine ground to a halt at approximately 11:30 a.m., Evers reached inside to dislodge a particularly thoughtful 700-word essay on the unrest in Syria that had become jammed.Apparently unprepared for the aggregator mechanism's quick restart, Evers was gruesomely dismembered by its rapidly spinning blades, which soaked the room in blood and unprocessed news content.
