Speaking to reporters for the final time as head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Benedict XVI vowed Wednesday that he would continue drawing his popular syndicated comic strip  after he steps down from office.The long-running daily comic, which Benedict reportedly brainstorms, sketches, and inks every afternoon, follows the misadventures of the duck-billed platypus Pope Papalpuss, his wisecracking sidekick Cardinal Songbird, and his grouchy, omnipotent boss God.
