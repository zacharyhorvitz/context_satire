Claiming that this could be America’s “big chance at big money,” the Department of the Treasury announced Wednesday that the country was poised to enter a bonus financial quarter worth double the cash.At an afternoon press event, Treasury Secretary Jacob “Jackie” Lew, clad in a sequined blazer and a tie adorned with a large dollar sign, confirmed that the economy’s performance in Q3 had qualified American markets for the so-called Bonanza Quarter, a special three-month “cavalcade of cold hard cash” during which U.S. corporations and households would have the opportunity to double their income, double their assets, and “move up the big board.”“Great to be back with you again—I’m Jackie Lew and I have some exciting news for American financial markets: That’s right, it’s once again time for a fiscal bonanza!” said the neatly coiffed cabinet official and host of the popular series  as an array of lights flashed on the podium around him.
