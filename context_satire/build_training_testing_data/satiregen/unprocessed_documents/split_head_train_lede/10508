Following their apprehension Thursday of would-be assassin Trent Beyer, law enforcement officials told reporters the 17-year-old student's attempted shooting rampage at East High School was "embarrassingly bad" and "didn't even come close" to causing any injuries or deaths.According to police reports, officers arrived at the scene to find Beyer in an empty hallway, holding a small-caliber pistol he struggled to load while simultaneously attempting to unfold a crude map of the school and consult a hastily scrawled list of teachers' and classmates' names.
