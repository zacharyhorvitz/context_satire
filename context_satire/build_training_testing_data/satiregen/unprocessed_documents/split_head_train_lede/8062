Nearly 20 years after launching its first nationwide recycling program, the Department of Sanitation unveiled a new environmental initiative Monday that urges citizens to separate perfectly good stuff, such as old toasters and empty picture frames, from the rest of their weekly trash.Officials said they expected the new program to eliminate hundreds of tons of totally usable and barely scratched waste over the next year.
