Calling his latest innovation the medium’s most exciting advancement in years, Academy Award–winning film pioneer James Cameron said Friday the future of movies would be watching them while sitting on his lap.Cameron, the keynote speaker at a film technology conference held at the University of Southern California, delivered a 45-minute presentation to industry experts detailing the state-of-the-art experience of viewing a feature-length motion picture atop his lap, which he said would “revolutionize cinema as we know it.”“Within the next five to 10 years, nearly every major Hollywood movie will be watched from my lap,” Cameron said following a presentation that featured a 3D rendering of the  director seated in a theater chair with moviegoers of various ages taking turns sitting down on his hips and leaning back against his torso.
