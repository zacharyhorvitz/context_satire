In a welcome break from their normal day-to-day schedule, reports confirmed that the winter class of interns at local web design firm Kapper Media, Inc. were treated to a highly informative 30-minute question-and-answer session Wednesday afternoon with an utterly miserable and downtrodden assortment of company employees.The staff panel, all of whom are under 30 and have over the course of their employment felt increasingly fatigued, stressed, and resentful, reportedly answered a variety of questions about their backgrounds and their experiences within the industry from the visibly excited group of interns.“I really enjoyed getting the chance to just sit down with everyone and learn more about how they got to where they are now,” said 21-year-old sales intern Diane Stevens, evidently unaware that the entire employee panel have at some point totally resigned themselves to being taken advantage of and feeling absolutely helpless to fight against the company’s corporate hierarchy.
