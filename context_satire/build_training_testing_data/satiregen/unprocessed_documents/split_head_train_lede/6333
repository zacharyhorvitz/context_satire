Faced with increasingly tight budgets, a growing number of U.S. schools no longer have the resources necessary to provide art classes with enough mannequins and human urine for each student, a report from the Education Policy Research Institute confirmed Friday.In a nationwide survey, a majority of public school teachers and administrators stated that a lack of sufficient funding has forced them to cut back on many of the basic materials—from brushes and paints, to sculpting tools and clay, to life-size dummies and human excreta—traditionally employed in art classrooms.“It’s sad, but my students don’t even have the supplies they need for an exercise as simple as depicting patriarchal oppression with a mannequin that has been painted orange, set on fire, and then doused with a bucket of warm urine,” said Robert Kessler, a sixth-grade art teacher in Cleveland, noting that his supply closet also lacks the old doll heads, used syringes, and Virgin Mary statuettes his pupils require.
