Announcing the creation of a genetically viable new menu item they said could soon appear in franchises nationwide, researchers with Subway’s sandwich breeding program revealed Thursday they had successfully developed a Black Forest Ham–Meatball Marinara hybrid.The footlong sub, which company officials say was selectively bred to incorporate the zesty traits of the Meatball Marinara bloodline with the natural smokiness of the Black Forest Ham genus, was unveiled at a press conference at Subway’s main sandwich breeding and husbandry facility within its corporate headquarters.“It’s taken over six years of genomic research and countless breeding attempts, but I’m happy to report that we’ve produced a robust new offspring from two of our most delicious subs,” said Noah Plattner, director of Subway’s sandwich breeding division, adding that the hybrid was morphologically compatible with any of the chain’s nine bread options.
