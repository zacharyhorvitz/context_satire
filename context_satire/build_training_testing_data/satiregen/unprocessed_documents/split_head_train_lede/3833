Billing the evening as a unique opportunity to get up close and personal with occupants of the thousand-bed facility, Boston General Hospital held its first-ever Night Among the Patients Saturday, a gathering that reportedly featured cocktails, hors dâ€™oeuvres, and live music.According to organizers, the 21-and-over, after-visiting-hours event allowed those in attendance to tour the hospital with drink in hand, clinking glasses with friends and looking on as critically injured arrivals were stabilized or patients with acute renal failure underwent dialysis.
