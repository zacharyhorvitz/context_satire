Immediately halting production on his latest project after hearing of the incredible talent, legendary actor Robert De Niro was reportedly stunned to learn Wednesday that Bayonne, NJ resident Eric Sullivan, 33, can quote the critically acclaimed 1990 Martin Scorsese film  at length.Witnesses confirmed that De Niro, who played gangster Jimmy Conway in the movie, refused to continue with the filming of HBO’s upcoming Bernie Madoff biopic, , until the gifted man could be brought before the actor to demonstrate his singular ability to repeat sections of dialogue from the Academy Award–winning crime drama.“Whoa, whoa, whoa—you’re saying this guy can recite 15 or 20 lines from the movie, fully and completely, without messing up or having to stop even once?” said De Niro after rushing over to a crew member who he had overheard telling several coworkers about Sullivan’s skill.
