Over the course of their dinner Tuesday evening at a local bar and grill, area woman Melissa Kowalski, 27, reportedly faced a constant stream of her date’s personal flaws so swift and intense that she could not possibly rationalize them all.Kowalski told reporters that throughout her 90-minute first date with 28-year-old digital media producer Colin Layner, she was unable to formulate the excuses and justifications necessary to keep pace with his rapidly emerging negative qualities, admitting that at numerous points she became completely overwhelmed by the unrelenting barrage of deficiencies in Layner’s behavior, background, career, general personality, and physical appearance.“The second we stepped into the restaurant, I had to tell myself that not holding the door open for me just meant that he wasn’t caught up in old-fashioned gender norms, but from there, his shortcomings just never let up,” Kowalski said, describing the deluge of her date’s social missteps, character defects, and lackluster table manners that she had to negotiate throughout the meal.
