Saying this time of year always dredges up memories of that fateful night, local man Alan Dahlgren admitted Wednesday he becomes emotional on the anniversary of his father’s passing, a death he personally orchestrated.Dahlgren, the 36-year-old owner of a lucrative family-run investment firm, said the 17th of January inevitably brings back the same raw, overwhelming feelings he experienced on the night in 2011 when a car “accident” he had meticulously planned over a period of more than six months took the life of his father.“I still remember it as clearly as if it happened yesterday: hearing my phone ring, stepping outside to take the call, getting the news about what had happened to Dad from the contract killer I’d hired,” said Dahlgren, sitting in his office near a portrait of his late father, a hard-drinking man with a short temper who “needed to be hurt the way he hurt us,” according to his son.
