In an effort to improve America’s ranking in the global technology sector, the U.S. Department of Education unveiled a new STEM initiative Friday designed to discourage students in other countries from choosing careers in science and math.Officials described the 10-year, $80 million strategic plan as the government’s most substantive STEM policy to date, saying it would include ad campaigns, after-school programs, and financial incentives aimed at dampening enthusiasm for all scientific and technological pursuits among students in more than 50 foreign nations.“U.S students have lagged behind in STEM fields for far too long, so now we’re taking steps to persuade kids in other countries that a degree in physics or biology or robotics just isn’t worth it,” said Education Secretary John King Jr., conceding the new measure is the only way our nation’s children can possibly keep pace with the rest of the world.
