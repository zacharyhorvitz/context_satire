Friends and coworkers of local man Alan Tessler confirmed Wednesday that whenever they feel discouraged or depressed, they need only think of their 36-year-old acquaintance to put everything back into perspective, a fact to which Tessler, by all accounts, remains completely oblivious.According to sources, Tessler is unaware that each of his friends bring him to mind when facing personal obstacles, relationship troubles, or a general sense of dissatisfaction with their lives, using the unmarried office equipment sales associate as a valuable reminder that they should be grateful for what they have.“If I have a rough day at work, or my wife and I get into a fight, I can always take a step back and be thankful that I’m not in Alan’s shoes,” longtime friend Daniel Carranza said of Tessler, who reportedly lives by himself, eats the same Chinese takeout meal most nights, and spends his weekends watching reality television competitions, and who furthermore has no idea whatsoever that his living situation is often used for therapeutic purposes by his closest companions.
