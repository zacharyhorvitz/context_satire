In what is being hailed as a major breakthrough by the scientific community, a team of researchers announced Monday that they had successfully taught American Sign Language to a 43-year-old gorilla-suit-wearing man.Scientists at the Oregon National Primate Research Center told reporters that Brian, a western Kansas–born gorilla-costumed male living in their facility, has already learned well over 250 words in sign language, including all 26 letters of the alphabet, basic greetings, and even several short, simple phrases.“It’s been an extensive process, but it’s remarkable to see Brian starting to express his thoughts and emotions to us with signing,” said lead researcher Rebecca Hayes, telling reporters that after just nine months of instruction, the full-grown great-ape-suit-wearing man is already capable of stringing his thoughts together into almost complete sentences.
