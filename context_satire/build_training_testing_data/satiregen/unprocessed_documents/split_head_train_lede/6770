The world scientific community is reeling following Monday's announcement by California Institute Of Technology astrophysicist Miles Lindgren that he has discovered evidence of a black hole at the center of his 27-year marriage, a commitment vortex from which no love can escape.Though evidence suggesting the possible presence of black holes has been documented by scientists in the past, Monday's discovery marks the first time anyone has ever proven the existence of one within an interpersonal relationship.At a press conference Monday at Cal Tech, a dispirited Lindgren announced his discovery in a flat, broken monotone: "Last night, while unsuccessfully attempting to interest my wife Harriet in sexual intercourse, I began noticing inconsistencies in our bedroom's electromagnetic radiation signatures that suggested they were being affected by an immense and joyless invisible force, leading me to suspect the presence of a massive black hole of joylessness and despair.
