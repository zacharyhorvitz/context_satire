Saying this was an important first step in helping their community heal, local authorities in Washington, D.C. confirmed this morning that they had demolished the Capitol Building in which the horrific 113th congressional session took place.According to officials, the decision to raze the 1.5 million-square-foot structure was aimed in particular at bringing closure to those whose lives were forever changed by the unspeakable acts committed there between January 2013 and January 2015.“By tearing down these walls that bore witness to what can only be described as a brazen assault on basic human values, we begin the long, difficult process of recovering from this grave tragedy,” said D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser, noting that over the past two years the Capitol Building had become a potent symbol of cruelty, immorality, and the “darker side of human nature.” “Perhaps with this demolition we can restore some measure of peace to our lives.”“We cannot erase what happened there, of course, and things will never be the same after what those monsters did,” Bowser added.
