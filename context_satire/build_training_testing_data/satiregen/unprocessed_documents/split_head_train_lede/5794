Citing the solemnity of the monument and the horrific events that led to its construction, eighth-grader Austin Holcombe just assumed his classmates wouldn’t bully him during his school’s field trip to the September 11 Memorial last Wednesday—an assumption that proved incorrect almost instantaneously, sources confirmed.“I guess I just figured, you know, clearly this is a very serious and very sad place, and they’ll just know it’s not right to mess with someone at Ground Zero,” said Holcombe, who upon entering the memorial was told by several classmates that he should stand underneath one of the commemorative waterfalls because he smelled like he shit his pants.
