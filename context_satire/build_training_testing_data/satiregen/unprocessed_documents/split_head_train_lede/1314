Despite local 22-year-old Sam Tillard’s best efforts to keep things quiet when he was invited home by girlfriend Jenny Nesbitt late last night, a report out this morning has confirmed her parents not only woke up but could hear the two in her bedroom the entire time.The report stated that even though their lights were off, Dale and Judy Nesbitt—whom Tillard hasn’t formally met yet—were fully aware of what was happening in their 21-year-old daughter’s room, from the moment Tillard coyly mentioned that it felt “so wrong to be doing this in [her] childhood bed” to the moment he collapsed and asked, “Was that good?”“Nesbitt’s parents could hear when Tillard parked the car, when he and Jenny came inside, when the two snuck upstairs, when they closed the door to her room, and when they got started,” the report read in part, adding that when Tillard paused and asked, “Do you think they’re up?” the middle-aged couple was definitely up.
