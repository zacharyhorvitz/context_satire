In what is being hailed as its single most ambitious messaging campaign to date, the Susan G. Komen foundation announced Thursday it had launched its first deep space probe, part of an effort to bring increased breast cancer awareness to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.Shortly after the morning liftoff, Komen officials told reporters they expect the vessel, which they have christened the , to promote regular screenings and education initiatives across the entire 120,000-light-year span of the Milky Way.The organization confirmed it had raised $1.3 billion to build the probe, approximately one quarter of which went toward painting the spacecraft pink, adding specialized pink fixtures to its interior, and outfitting its hull with glowing pink lights.“I couldn’t be more excited to be standing here on this historic day, when we take the fight against breast cancer to the outer limits of our solar system and beyond,” said the group’s founder and chair of global strategy Nancy Brinker, speaking at a post-launch gala held on the 1,400-acre campus of the new state-of-the-art Susan G. Komen Space Center.
