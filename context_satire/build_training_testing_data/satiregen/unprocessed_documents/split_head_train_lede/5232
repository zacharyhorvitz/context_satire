Touting robust traffic on par with some of its most popular games, representatives from Las Vegas’ Bellagio resort said Thursday that the casino was enjoying steady profits from a new slot machine that explicitly guarantees players they will lose.The Lose Your Dollar machines, 48 of which were reportedly installed on the casino’s main gaming floor several weeks ago, feature a large, prominent placard bolted to the front panel that unambiguously notifies players in six different languages that they have absolutely no chance of receiving any kind of payout.“We’re incredibly pleased there’s been such demand for a slot that makes winning utterly impossible,” said casino representative Kelly Ambrose, emphasizing that while some slot machines have traditionally offered longer odds than others, Lose Your Dollar is the first to remove success from gameplay entirely.
