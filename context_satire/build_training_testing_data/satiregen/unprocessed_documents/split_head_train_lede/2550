While she regularly offers guidance to younger women as they make their way in an industry largely dominated by men, Colleen Miller of tech firm Roltronix told reporters Tuesday she also enjoys knocking one or two down from time to time, just as a treat to herself.As the sole female executive at a company that employs far more men than women, the 47-year-old vice president of development explained that she’s always glad to provide advice, encouragement, or a bit of camaraderie to new female employees, while also at times singling one out and tearing her down with a few choice words when she feels she needs a little boost.“Close mentoring relationships are vital if we want more women to succeed in this business, but every now and then it’s really satisfying to just smack a younger colleague down real quick and watch her go crawling back to her desk,” said Miller, admitting that after all the positive reinforcement and support she administers each day, the experience of brusquely putting a coworker in her place is an enjoyable, refreshing change of pace.
