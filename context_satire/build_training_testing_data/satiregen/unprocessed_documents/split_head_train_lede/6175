Observing that she is way ahead of other girls her age, sources close to precocious 4-year-old Tessa Davison confirmed Wednesday that she already feels completely terrible about herself.Davison’s parents and teachers told reporters the exceptional preschooler has already begun to think of herself as a completely worthless person who will never be as smart or likable as everyone else, a mindset, they were quick to point out, most girls don’t start developing until middle school.“Tessa isn’t even 5 yet, but she’ll spend hours worrying about the way she looks and whether other kids think she’s dumb—she’s way ahead of the curve with that stuff,” said Davison’s mother, Sarah, who noted that other children’s parents are often surprised by her daughter’s remarkable ability to see awful qualities in herself.
