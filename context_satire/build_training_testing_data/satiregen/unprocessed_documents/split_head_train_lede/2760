As she entered her third day vacationing with the family of friend and classmate Jessica Matthieson, 15-year-old Kayla Phelps confided to reporters Tuesday that cracks had begun to emerge in the facade of domestic harmony that the Matthiesons had consistently projected.Phelps, who prior to the present trip had never spent more than a few hours at a time with the family of four, confirmed that several cold stares and emotional outbursts she has witnessed so far at the Matthiesons’ rented lakeside cabin have led her to believe her friend’s home life may not be as happy as she had always assumed.“I’ve been to Jessica’s house for dinner before, and her family always seemed really sweet and nice, but I’m starting to see a different side out here,” said Phelps, remarking that midway through the weeklong vacation the Matthiesons appeared to have become less adept at keeping up their usual appearances.
