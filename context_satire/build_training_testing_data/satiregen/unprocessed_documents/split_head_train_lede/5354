With the most high-profile competition of their careers just weeks away, thousands of athletes who will ultimately disgrace and embarrass their respective home countries are eagerly completing their training for the 2014 Winter Olympics, sources confirmed Tuesday.Carrying the hopes and dreams of their nations, these men and women reportedly continue to rise before dawn every day to engage in rigorous workouts while unaware that nearly all of them will soon humiliate both themselves and their homeland in front of every nation on earth.“I’m so thrilled to have qualified for Sochi, but I know I really need to maintain my focus these last few weeks,” said Pavel Navitski of Belarus, a luger and, according to sources, one of many, many Olympians whose family and friends will shun him for years, if not the rest of his life, after he completely strips his country of its pride on the world’s biggest stage.
