Local man Tom Pletcher, 38, reportedly blocked off his entire Sunday to run a number of errands he has been meaning to get around to, including having his brakes checked, renewing his passport, and oh, look, Pletcher told reporters, the 1996 romantic sports comedy  is on.Pletcher, who noted he's been so busy at work lately he hasn't had time to get anything else done, said that, nice, he's pretty sure the TBS showing of the film just started because Don Johnson's character just asked Tin Cup to caddy for him, which he said is a little bit after Rene Russo's first golf lesson.
