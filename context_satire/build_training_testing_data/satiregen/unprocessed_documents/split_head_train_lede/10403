While emphasizing that they appreciated the pontiff’s support, local newlyweds John Greene and Adam Liu admitted today that they were nevertheless a little weirded out by Pope Francis standing in the back of their wedding ceremony on Saturday.John Greene told reporters that shortly after he and his new husband heeded the ordained minister’s request to join hands and face each other, the pair took one last glance at the audience and noticed the Bishop of Rome standing quietly near a back wall and smiling.“I guess I’m flattered that he decided to come to our wedding for some reason, but at the same time, I have to say, it was a little off-putting,” Greene said of the ecclesiastical leader’s presence at the non-denominational ceremony, which he attended alone.
