With their continued investment in projects aimed at reaching out to the 14-year-old inner-city resident, the nation’s marketers are the last group of people in the country still trying to get through to local child Derek Crawford, sources confirmed Wednesday.As they strive to understand the concerns of the boy and have an influence on the decisions he makes as he grows older, marketing professionals across the U.S. have reportedly demonstrated more interest in Crawford than any teacher, social worker, policymaker, nonprofit organization, or government agency has during his entire life.“It is imperative that we put ourselves in this kid’s shoes and get a real sense of what his life is like,” said Peter Bennett, chief strategist at Brooks, Bennett, & Mills, a New York firm that has helped market Samsung mobile phones, Monster Energy drinks, and numerous video game consoles, as he presided over a meeting dedicated to learning as much as possible about Crawford and his peers.
