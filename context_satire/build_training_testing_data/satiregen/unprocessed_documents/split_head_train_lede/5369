If you’re an Xbox fanboy who was salivating over what the next gen could offer, you might want to sit down because we have disappointing news coming from the X019 press event: Microsoft just confirmed that Project Scarlett is actually just an expansive brothel they’re constructing in Thailand where Xboxes can go to be pleasured.While being able to send your past Xbox models to the Bangkok suburb of Nonthaburi for an erotic weekend to have their ports fingered and optical drive whipped definitely sounds like a nice perk, we can’t help but feel this is going to be a huge blow for anyone looking to the next-gen for the latest and greatest in graphics and gameplay.“What we’re offering with Project Scarlett is an all-inclusive package of sexual fulfillment and exotic excitement for any of our consoles at the hands of some absolutely beautiful Thai escorts,” said Microsoft executive vice president Phil Spencer, explaining that all fans need to do is ship their Xbox, Xbox 360, or Xbox One to Project Scarlett in southern Thailand to guarantee them several nights of unforgettable pleasures amidst the sultry South Asian scents of freshly cracked coconuts and Ratchaphruek blossoms.
