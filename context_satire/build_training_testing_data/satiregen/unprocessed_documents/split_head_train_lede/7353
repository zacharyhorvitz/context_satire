Suggesting she’d better “sit down and buckle up tight,” officials from Michigan’s Child Protective Services bureau urged caseworker Hayley Reynolds on Thursday to brace herself, because she was in for grade-A doozy.The case, described by fellow CPS staff members as a real humdinger, is reportedly the kind of investigation that only comes along once every 15 or 20 years, and will require Reynolds to “muster up everything she’s got” if she wants to come out of this mess still in one piece.“Hoo boy,” said CPS deputy director Matthew Jackson, who nervously drummed his fingers on the thick manila folder and warned Reynolds to keep her afternoons free for the foreseeable future because she was about to get handed a biggie.
