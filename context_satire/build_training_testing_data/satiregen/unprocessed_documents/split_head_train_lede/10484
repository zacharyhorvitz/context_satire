By CIVIL WAR enthusiasts PRESAGED and PRE-ENACTED, in Manassas, Virginia, the Battle of Bull Runne, which in a mere eight Decades, shall be Shewn as the first Great Battle of a WAR Between the STATES; Accurate was the Depiction, even of Things not yet Invented, such as the Sharps RIFLE, and the man from ILLINOIS, and the Long PANTS; and Greatly were the Pre-Enactors Enthused, and asked all to always Premember the sad Day yet to come, when our Nation was rent asunder and Brother will fight Brother, an' pray it never happen Again, excepting in 78 Years, when it should Come to Pass in order to Avoid a Temp'ral PARADOX.
