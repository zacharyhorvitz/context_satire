Heralding the breakthrough as a landmark achievement for artificial intelligence, engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced Thursday that they have successfully developed the first robot capable of feeling human lust.Lead researcher Tomás Soto, who confirmed that the invention features a highly advanced operating system, powerful data processors, and cutting-edge optical sensors, told reporters that the machine’s behavior was so lifelike that it can take one look at a person and grow uncontrollably aroused, becoming completely consumed by its own passionate sexual appetite.“The idea that a robot might lust, much like you or I can lust, has long captured the imaginations of scientists,” said Soto, adding that for decades engineers have strived to create automatons with the ability to feel intense carnal yearning.
