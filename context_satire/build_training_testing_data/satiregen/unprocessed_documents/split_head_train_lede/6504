In a discovery that has greatly expanded the scientific community’s fundamental understanding of oddballs, a team of anthropologists from Columbia University announced Friday the identification of 43 new species of weirdo residing within the New York City subway system.The findings, set to be published in the July issue of , are the culmination of 10 years of research spent observing weirdos in their natural habitat of subway cars and platforms throughout the New York metropolitan area, where the peculiar creatures groom themselves, feign seizures, nibble on raw kale, scratch the same word exactly 63 times into train car windows, masturbate through their pants, and scream at no one in particular.“Studying these newly classified weirdos has significantly broadened our knowledge of the subway system’s vast diversity of lowlife,” said lead researcher Anita DePalio, noting that scientists were now actively investigating how the new species relate to the 400 bizarre and outlandish varieties previously observed and categorized in the broader public transit environment.
