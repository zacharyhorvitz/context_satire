Despite claims from the TV news outlet to offer "nonstop news" and "coverage you can count on," an  investigation has uncovered hundreds of instances in which KAMR Channel 4  team relied almost exclusively on news reports, weather forecasts, and even special-interest features already generated by the station’s  team.In an examination of 98 consecutive prime-time and late-night broadcasts, including dozens more nationwide, the Amarillo-based station—the region’s self-styled "News Leader"—repeatedly ran pieces for its Health Beat, Pet Patrol, and Bargain Busters segments in both evening news slots, and regularly relayed the same weather updates and traffic reports up to 15 times a day.
