Saying he never imagined he’d one day be filling a basilica as large and prestigious as St. Peter’s, Pope Francis recalled to reporters this morning how he started his career preaching at some real shithole churches.“Back in the ’70s, I was just an up-and-coming minister driving my van from village to village across Argentina to deliver sermons in front of audiences of 10 or 15 people,” said Francis, noting that in those days, as a recently ordained member of the clergy, he typically was one of the last priests to go up and perform worship service each evening.
