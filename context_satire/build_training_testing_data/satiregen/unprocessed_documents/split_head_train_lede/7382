Shedding light on the emotional state of Coldplay’s frontman and his internal process while composing the iconic ballad, researchers at the Berklee College of Music published a study Monday confirming that Chris Martin probably cried when he wrote “Fix You.” “After months of inquiry, analysis, music theory breakdowns, interviews with those closest to the writer and composer, and listening to the song ourselves and paying attention to how it made us feel inside, we can say with complete confidence that Chris Martin was probably feeling pretty down when he created the melody to ‘Fix You,’ and may have even gotten all choked up,” said lead researcher Yvette Daniels in a summary of the study’s findings, the conclusion of which was derived from a statistical simulation run over 80 times, nearly all of which determined that Martin had no choice but to bawl his eyes out at crucial points of the song’s creation process.
