Noting that he relies upon the website every day to keep himself apprised of important national and global events, sources confirmed Thursday that the only news outlet local man Andrew Howland trusts uses an image of an eyeball in crosshairs as its logo.According to reports, the single news source in which the 27-year-old college graduate places confidence is called TruthLink.net, and features in its upper-left-hand corner—directly adjacent to the site’s austere, black-and-red nameplate—a low-resolution photo of a human eye behind two intersecting lines and a circle intended to represent the sights of a gun.“The mainstream media is controlled by these big corporations, so you have to dig deeper if you want to know what’s really going on,” said Howland, who regularly reads articles that are rendered in bright green text over a black background and that contain entire paragraphs written in all capital letters for emphasis.
