Noting that the 26-year-old with unfulfilled physical needs is easygoing and really fun to hang out with, several of Sarah Valetta’s male friends told reporters Tuesday that the sexually frustrated woman is pretty much one of the guys.Sources close to the situation confirmed that the woman, who is constantly consumed by carnal longing, is remarkably laid-back, easy to talk to, and generally willing to grab a beer without much advance notice.“Sarah’s really awesome,” said Valetta’s friend Mark McKean, 27, explaining that the perennially single, sexually pent-up woman is completely comfortable kicking back and watching sports, playing cards, or just shooting the shit.
