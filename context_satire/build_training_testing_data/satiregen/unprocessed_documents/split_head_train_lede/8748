Visiting the home of running mate Mitt Romney today, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) was reportedly knocked to the floor by a pack of rambunctious, wet-nosed Romney boys, all five of whom jumped onto the vice presidential candidate as soon as he entered the door and sniffed him from head to toe.Sources said the Romney boys—Tagg, Craig, Matt, Ben, and Josh—spent nearly three minutes eagerly licking the congressman’s face and slobbering all over his jacket before their father, Mitt, grabbed them by their shirt collars and pulled them off, telling Ryan, “They always get a little excited when we have visitors.”“As soon as I rang the doorbell they came running right up to the door,” said Ryan, noting that the oldest one, Tagg, got so excited he urinated on the family’s rug.
