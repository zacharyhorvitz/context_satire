Suggesting that the disastrous events of three months ago could have been averted, federal investigators stated Wednesday that a trove of leaked documents confirmed high-ranking studio executives had full knowledge of  long before the film was released onto unsuspecting Americans.Sources said the documents—reportedly turned over to the FBI by an anonymous informant at Lionsgate Films—include email correspondence, memos, and financial records indicating the vast extent of negligence on the part of top-level management, who, despite knowing of plans to unleash the fantasy-action epic on the public more than three years in advance, chose to do nothing.“As early as March 2013, people in key positions at the studio were clearly aware of coordinated efforts to screen  in major metropolitan areas across the country,” said lead investigator Timothy Benfield, pointing out dozens of damning emails to Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer that laid out the film’s disturbing storyline step by step and confirmed its imminent distribution.
