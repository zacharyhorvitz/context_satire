Saying that the species has thus far defied all scientific projections, stunned officials from the Marine Conservation Institute announced Tuesday that the past half century of climate change and habitat loss somehow hasn’t managed to take down the goddamned parrotfish.According to conservation biologists, rising ocean temperatures, increased runoff of chemicals into coastal waters, and the decimation of coral reefs haven’t even come close to putting these vibrantly colored tropical sons of bitches on the endangered list, let alone succeeded in wiping them out completely.“Considering the unprecedented disruption to their ecosystems, the parrotfish should have been eradicated years ago, but remarkably, these little bastards are still around,” said Dr. Elliott Norse, the institute’s chief scientist, noting that overfishing alone ought to have done in the shallow-water ocean dweller “10 times over.” “I’m just shocked that with all the oil spills, greenhouse gas emissions, and God knows what else we’re throwing at them, we haven’t finished them off yet.
