By Van Jones, CNN Contributor (CNN) -- Tonight, our nation's first black president will deliver the first State of the Union of his historic second term.  Hacker collective Anonymous announced plans to disrupt Web streams of Tuesday night's State of the Union address in protest of various Obama administration policies. In a posting on one of its Web pages, the group claimed it would target live streams of the speech, to be broadcast on the official White House site as well as many major news websites, including CNN. Television feeds of the speech weren't mentioned. However, the attack didn't appear to happen.
