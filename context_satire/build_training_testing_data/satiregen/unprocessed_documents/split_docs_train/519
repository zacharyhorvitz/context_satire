By the late 1950s, intercity rail passenger volumes had declined dramatically with the coming of the Jet Age and the Interstate Highway System. Even before then, the station's exterior had become somewhat grimy. Due to its vast scale, the station was very expensive to maintain. A renovation around this time covered some of the grand columns with plastic and blocked off the spacious central hallway with a new ticket office. Amtrak took over intercity passenger rail operations from the private railroads on May 1, 1971. Initial service on the Seattle–Portland portion of the corridor consisted of three daily round trips–one long-distance train running all the way to San Diego, along with two corridor trains inherited from Burlington Northern. There was no corridor service south to Eugene, and no service to the Canadian border at all. The trains were unnamed until November 1971, when the two corridor trains were named the Mount Rainier and Puget Sound and the long-distance train  became the Coast Starlight. In 1991, the opening of the Empire Connection allowed Amtrak to consolidate all of its New York City trains at Penn Station. Previously, all trains traveling along the Empire Corridor originated and terminated at nearby Grand Central Terminal–a legacy of most of those routes previously being part of the New York Central Railroad. Previously, passengers transferring between Northeast Corridor and Empire Corridor routes had to make their own way between the two stations. The two stations have never been connected, even after they both came under ownership of Penn Central in the 1960s and after Amtrak took over all intercity service in 1971.
