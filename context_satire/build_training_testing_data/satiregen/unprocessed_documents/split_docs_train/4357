McGuire and Young made a third film together, Claudia and David (1946), a sequel to Claudia, which was less well received. Schary and RKO put her in Till the End of Time, a popular hit. She later said, "I fought the hardest for this role and it was my least successful. I went right back to playing nice girls and faithful wives. " Beck writes a novel implicating Dr. Nicky in her murder to convince Joe that she understands him. He later leaves her again at night and kills Ron. Later, Paco helps Joe cover up Ron's murder because of how grateful he is. In his last conversation with Beck, Joe finally understands the truth: Beck will never love him. Brought to Hollywood by producer David O. Selznick (who called her "a born actress") on the strength of her stage performance, McGuire starred in her first film Claudia (1943), a movie adaptation of her Broadway success, portraying a child bride who almost destroys her marriage through her selfishness. Selznick developed the project then sold it to 20th Century Fox; under this deal Selznick would share McGuire's services with Fox.
