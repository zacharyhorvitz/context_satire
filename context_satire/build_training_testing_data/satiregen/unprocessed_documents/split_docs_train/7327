It was disclosed in November 2006 that Lord Stevens had met with Paul's elderly parents telling them that their son was not drunk. Just prior to Stevens's appearance at the inquest, a source close to Stevens stated that this inconsistency could be explained as him being "considerate" and "sensitive" towards the elderly couple, an assessment Scott Baker suggested might be credible in his opening comments to the jury. Under cross-examination at the inquest in February 2008, Stevens denied "deliberately misleading" Paul's parents and said that the chauffeur's condition at the time of the crash did not match the police's definition of being drunk, which he said relied upon someone's physical responses. Stevens said that the available evidence suggested Paul had consumed only two alcoholic drinks, but this was not necessarily all that Paul had consumed, and that he was indeed "under the influence" of alcohol at the time of the crash. "Always You" is the oldest song on the album, teased by Tomlinson in early 2017 with cryptic posts on Twitter and Instagram In August 2017 Tomlinson posted the first 13 seconds of the track that contained the lyrics "I went to Amsterdam without you, and all I could do was think about you" on his Instagram story. Tomlinson said that the song pays tribute to his on-and-off girlfriend Eleanor Calder and it was "kind of about my story of travelling the world and just being a f*****g idiot and going, 'Of course it was always you'." More revealing was the statement given by Diana's eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who testified that in a phone conversation with Diana on Friday 29 August, Diana spoke about Dodi Fayed in a manner that gave her sister the impression the relationship was on "stony ground". Statements from other friends and confidantes Diana spoke to in the week before her death, including her butler Paul Burrell, her friend Lady Annabel Goldsmith, and her spiritual adviser Rita Rogers, were unanimous that she was firm about not wanting to get engaged or married to anyone at that point in her life. A week before she died, the princess had told Goldsmith: "I need marriage like a rash on my face."
