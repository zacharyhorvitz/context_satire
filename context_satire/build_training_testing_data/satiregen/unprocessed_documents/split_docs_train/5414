In October 2011, the band announced that Holcomb was now the band's full-time guitarist, and in November bassist Tom Murphy decided to leave the band. This led to Getgood being assigned the role of bassist for their European tour with Dream Theater. The band also hired Holcomb's brother Jeff as a stand-in bass player for their 2012 US tour with Protest The Hero, Jeff Loomis, The Safety Fire and Today I Caught the Plague. 2001 was the first year that the Kinderspiel des Jahres was officially awarded. Prior to that year, it was the Sonderpreis "Kinderspiel" (Special Prize for Best Children's Game). Since the intent behind both awards is the same, it is customary to refer to the 1989â€“2000 Sonderpreis winners as having won the Kinderspiel des Jahres. Mike Holcomb is an American politician and member of the Arkansas House of Representatives representing District 10 since January 14, 2013.
