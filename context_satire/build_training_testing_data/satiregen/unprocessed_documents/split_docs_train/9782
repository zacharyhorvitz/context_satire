The 850-foot (260 m) tall, 58-story tower will be located at Union Street between 4th and 5th Avenues adjacent to the existing Rainier Tower, and will be the second-tallest building in Seattle upon completion. The $600 million project is scheduled to be completed by 2020, and will be the tallest building constructed in the city since 1985.
