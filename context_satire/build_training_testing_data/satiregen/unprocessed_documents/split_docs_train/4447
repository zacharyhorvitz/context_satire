 Pope Francis had a virtual papal audience with Catholics in three U.S. cities Monday and surprised a teenage girl in Chicago with a request that she sing for him. The pope, who is arriving in the U.S. in September, spoke from the Vatican via satellite in an event orchestrated by ABC News. ABC called it a "televised virtual audience with Americans." The network organized the event in secret and announced it shortly after the taping concluded. One morning in February 1208, Francis was hearing Mass in the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels, near which he had then built himself a hut. The Gospel of the day was the "Commissioning of the Twelve" from the Book of Matthew. The disciples are to go and proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand. Francis was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty. Francis stuck to his informal ways while baptizing 32 babies in the Sistine Chapel, inviting the women to breastfeed their children there "if they are hungry." While almost unheard of during Catholic church services in Italy, this is regarded as another of his efforts "to break down the stiff protocol in the Vatican."
