The U.S. Administration released graphic pictures of the Hussein brothers' bodies. Afterwards, their bodies were reconstructed by morticians to assure the public that they were deceased. For example, Uday's beard was trimmed and an 8-inch metal bar in his leg from the 1996 assassination attempt was removed. When criticized, the U.S. military's response was to point out that these men were no ordinary combatants, and to express hope that confirmation of the deaths would bring closure to the Iraqi people. Gegeo was the personal bodyguard of the former president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, and served as his valet and food taster. Gegeo is said to have introduced Saddam to his second wife, Samira Shahbandar, and arranged trysts between them. Saddam's son Uday took this as an insult to his mother, Saddam's first wife. In 2011, Caesar interviewed various people from the time of the Hussein regime. Although Saddam's purported use of body doubles was widely known, two confidantes of Uday Hussein denied that he used doubles. One said that Yahia was arrested for impersonation of Uday in 1990, and the other corroborated the incident, also stating that Yahia pretended to be Uday to pick up women. A private guard at Saddam's presidential palace from 1989 to 2003 also denied that Uday used doubles.
