 Florida officials struggled to manage their cybersecurity and failed to heed multiple warnings as Russian hackers attacked electoral systems throughout the state and successfully breached two counties in 2016, according to newly unveiled details in a bipartisan Senate report. The Senate Intelligence Committee's redacted chapter on election security, released Thursday, concluded that the Russian government "directed extensive activity against US election infrastructure" from 2014 through 2017 and that the Russian efforts "exploited the seams" between the federal authorities and states. The report also found that all 50 states were likely targeted. It doesn't name Florida directly; every state besides Illinois is simply assigned a number to protect its identity.  Republicans in the Senate have twice in 24 hours blocked the advancement of bills aimed at strengthening election security just hours after former special counsel Robert Mueller warned of the continued threat that foreign powers interfering in US elections. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell came to the Senate floor Thursday to personally object to House-passed legislation backed by Democrats. This comes after Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi objected to a trio of bills on Wednesday, in keeping with long standing GOP arguments that Congress has already responded to election security needs for the upcoming election. Democratic Sens.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday seemed to indicate the US was softening its position on congressionally mandated sanctions for Turkey over its purchase of the S-400 Russian missile defense system, stressing that the country should not make the missile defense system "operational." "There could be more sanctions to follow but frankly what we'd really like is for the S-400 not to become operational," Pompeo told Bloomberg Television. "That's our objective. It's what we've been talking to the Turks about for months and months."
