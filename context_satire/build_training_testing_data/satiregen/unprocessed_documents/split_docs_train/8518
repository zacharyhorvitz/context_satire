The film begins with Cal Weaver, (Steve Carell) a middle-aged man, being told by his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) – with whom he has been married for almost 25 years – that she has cheated on him with a coworker, David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon), and wants a divorce. On the way home from dinner, Cal refuses to speak to Emily while she drives and tries to verbalize where their marriage went wrong and what led her to cheat. Cal requests that Emily stop talking but she continues, Cal opens the passenger door and rolls out of the moving car. Cal and Emily arrive home where 17-year-old Jessica Riley (Analeigh Tipton) is babysitting their middle-school-aged son (who is in love with Jessica) and youngest daughter. On June 16, 1928, Dewey married Frances Eileen Hutt. A native of Sherman, Texas, she was a stage actress; after their marriage she dropped her acting career. They had two sons, Thomas E. Dewey Jr. and John Martin Dewey. Although Dewey served as a prosecutor and District Attorney in New York City for many years, his home from 1939 until his death was a large farm, called "Dapplemere," located near the town of Pawling some 65 miles (105 km) north of New York City. At Robbie's eighth-grade graduation, Robbie is the salutatorian and begins to give a pessimistic speech about how he no longer believes in true love and soulmates. Cal stops him and instead begins to recount his courtship with Emily to the audience, saying that, while he does not know if things will work out, he will never give up on Emily. With renewed faith, Robbie reaffirms his love for Jessica, to the audience's applause. After the ceremony, Cal gives Jacob and Hannah his blessing.
