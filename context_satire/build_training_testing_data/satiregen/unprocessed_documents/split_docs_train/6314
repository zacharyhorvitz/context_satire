 Hillary Clinton was keenly aware of how long she'd gone as a presidential candidate without sitting down for a nationally televised interview. "Ninety days on Sunday," she told CNN's Brianna Keilar on Tuesday in the first of what will be a series of national interviews. As Bernie Sanders rises in the polls among liberals and Republicans continue to make Clinton the subject of a barrage of attacks, her answers offered some insight into the Democratic frontrunner's thinking at this stage of the campaign. Here are eight of Clinton's key statements -- and why they matter for 2016: 1. Hillary Clinton reduced her already limited scheduled appearances in Wisconsin, with her campaign feeling disadvantaged by Governor of Wisconsin Jim Doyle's endorsement of Obama and the fact that independent voters are able to vote in the state's Democratic primary. Clinton made Obama's refusals to add any additional debates to the campaign schedule a primary focus of her messaging in Wisconsin, saying, "I will meet Senator Obama any place in the state. There's only been one debate between the two of us. This has only been a two person race for a little over two weeks. On November 12, 2007, the New York Times reported that "At two campaign events in Iowa this year, aides to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton encouraged audience members to ask her specific questions, a tactic that drew criticism from an opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination and led her yesterday to promise that it would not happen again." In response, Clinton remarked, 'It was news to me  and neither I nor my campaign approve of that, and it will certainly not be tolerated.'"
