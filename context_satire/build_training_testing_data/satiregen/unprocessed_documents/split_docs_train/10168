The Enron collapse and ensuing investigation prompted scrutiny of the company's financial reporting, which that year was audited by Arthur Andersen. Arthur Andersen was eventually indicted for obstruction of justice for shredding documents related to the audit in the Enron scandal. The resulting conviction, although it was later overturned, still effectively meant the end of Arthur Andersen, because the firm was not allowed to take on new clients while they were under investigation. Most of its country practices around the world were sold to members of what is now the Big Four -notably Ernst & Young (now known as EY) globally; Deloitte & Touche in the United Kingdom, Canada, Spain, and Brazil; and PricewaterhouseCoopers (now known as PwC) in China and Hong Kong. Investors in Guangdong Kelon Electrical Holdings Company Limited have claimed that there was a failure to alert them to the company's poor financial position. Deloitte claims it did a good job on the project. Deloitte's global CEO defended the firm's work on the Kelon matter. The firm was the auditor for thirty months from 2002 to 2004.
