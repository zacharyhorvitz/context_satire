 Long before Donald Trump declared his presidential candidacy, conservative strategist Steve Bannon sought to leverage data-driven technology to push the hearts and minds of voters toward his populist vision for America. Former Cambridge Analytica staffers tell CNN that Bannon's vision came to fruition through their previous employer, which they described as a weapon of psychological warfare. They say that Cambridge Analytica's parent company had worked on government and military contracts that aimed to change foreign populations' behaviors, which aligned with Bannon's intentions. Two former employees said that Bannon was personally involved in the company's early stages and that he played a direct role shaping its strategy and goals.  Wrong on the key specifics. And even more wrong on the larger meaning. That's the dual bottom line on the extraordinary screed last week against diversity in general, and immigration in particular, from Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson. Taking off from a National Geographic article that profiled the growing Hispanic population in the small town of Hazelton, Pennsylvania, Carlson said the change there "tells you a lot about demographics in America and how bewilderingly fast they are changing without any real public debate on the subject."  Batulo weaves through the crush of passengers streaming down the train station stairs. It is loud -- so loud. Suitcases rumble and announcements blare and no one seems to know which way to go. But Batulo heads directly for the airport entrance.
