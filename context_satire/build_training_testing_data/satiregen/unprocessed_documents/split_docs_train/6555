Seaton wrote The Song of Bernadette (1943) which was a big success. It was produced by William Perlberg who would have an important influence on Seaton's career. Seaton and Perlberg were borrowed by MGM to direct and produce a comedy with Clark Gable and Doris Day, Teacher's Pet (1958). He did not write. The show opened with a tribute to Richard Rodgers, featuring a medley of his songs performed by Marvin Hamlisch, Harry Connick Jr., Michele Lee, Mos Def, Lea Salonga, Peter Gallagher, John Raitt, Bernadette Peters, Gregory Hines, and the company of Oklahoma! A Broadway/New York song medley was performed by Bernadette Peters and Gregory Hines.
