 During the summer, you'll likely find most kids in swimming pools, collecting Pokemon or at camp. Most kids. But for 20 Cleveland high school students, their summer has been devoted to building an all-terrain, bomb-seeking robot. A team from the Youth Technology Academy at Cuyahoga Community College built the bot in anticipation of the Republican National Convention, to rove the grounds around the Quicken Loans Arena.  The head of Cleveland's largest police union is calling on Ohio Gov. John Kasich to temporarily tighten the state's gun laws during this week's Republican National Convention following Sunday's shooting in Louisiana that killed three officers and wounded at least three others. "We are sending a letter to Gov. Kasich requesting assistance from him.  Mike Pence made an impassioned effort to unite Republicans around Donald Trump, billing him as a latter day Ronald Reagan on a raucous night at the party's Cleveland convention. The GOP vice presidential nominee stepped up in an electric atmosphere in the Quicken Loans Arena shortly after Texas Sen. Ted Cruz exacerbated the party's divides by refusing to publicly endorse Trump in his own speech. "You have nominated a man for president who never quits, who never backs down, a fighter, a winner. Until now, he has had to do it all by himself against all odds -- but this week, with this united party, he has got back up," Pence roared above the cheering crowd.
