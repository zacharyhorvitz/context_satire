Charlie Rockit's aunt and uncle is in danger of losing his farm because he needs $50,000 to replace their broken tractor. To raise the money, Chuck E. Cheese, Jasper T. Jowls, Mr. Munch and Helen Henny decide to race in the Galaxy 5000 on the planet Orion (to which they travel via Pasqually's Awesome Adventure Machine). Another version was created for the popular restaurant chain Chuck E. Cheese's for one of its animatronic shows (Reddick is the current voice of Chuck E. Cheese) from September 2013, using the same lyric changes as the Radio Disney version. After performing the show, bandmate Jasper T. Jowls notably breaks the fourth wall by commenting, "Is it just me, or does Chuck sound a lot like the guy who originally sang that song?" When the first location opened in 1977, the animatronic characters were featured in framed portraits hanging on the walls of the main dining area, but they are no longer in use today. The original show featured Crusty The Cat (the first character to face retirement as he was soon replaced with Mr. Munch in 1978), Pasqually the singing chef, Jasper T. Jowls, the Warblettes, and the main focus of the show, Chuck E. Cheese. In the early 90s, when the franchise unified Chuck E. Cheese with ShowBiz Pizza, the animatronics used for the Rock-afire Explosion band were redressed as "Munch's Make Believe Band", with Chuck E., Jasper, Helen Henny, Munch, and Pasqually costumes replacing the Rock-afire characters.
