 For all the talk of a possible cease-fire, residents of Israel and Palestinians in Gaza are living under a daily barrage of attacks. More than 1,200 Palestinians have been killed, as have 53 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel. Israel said it has wiped out the majority of Hamas' rocket supply, but the fighting shows no sign of abating. "If the enemy has not had enough of our strikes, our fighters have a lot to surprise the enemy's leaders and its special forces," Hamas said Tuesday in an online posting.  A river of blood runs through Gaza, as homes are smashed to rubble and hospital emergency rooms overflow. The volley of Hamas rockets into Israel continues, even when met with the preeminent firepower of the Israeli military's  bombs, missiles and shells. The legions of dead are swelling by the hundreds. It's horrifying.  The Israeli military denied Sunday that it was responsible for anyone killed last week when a mortar hit the courtyard of a U.N. school that was shelter to many Gaza residents. Officials from the United Nations and the Palestinian government said 16 people were killed and hundreds wounded on Thursday when the school in northern Gaza was struck. "A single errant Israeli mortar landed in the courtyard in the school," Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. "The footage we have shows the courtyard was empty."
