 Three coalition troops and one civilian were killed Saturday in Afghanistan -- their deaths coming in two separate instances, one in the eastern part of the country and the other in the west -- NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. Two American soldiers and an American civilian were shot dead by a gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform in the eastern Paktika province, according to an ISAF spokeswoman. The shooter was killed and another was arrested, the coalition force said in a statement later Saturday. By then, the forward operating base where the attack occurred had been secured. Americans are nationals and citizens of the United States of America. Although nationals and citizens make up the majority of Americans, some dual citizens, expatriates, and permanent residents may also claim American nationality. The United States is home to people of many different ethnic origins. As a result, American culture and law does not equate nationality with race or ethnicity, but with citizenship and permanent allegiance.  Americans' collective wealth hit a record $70.3 trillion in the first quarter of 2013, seemingly wiping out all the losses from the recession. The previous high had been $68.1 trillion in the third quarter of 2007, according to the latest quarterly flow of funds report from the Federal Reserve, released Thursday. But there's a catch: These figures don't account for inflation. Household wealth is still $5.1 trillion, or 6.7%, below its peak if you factor in inflation.
