 WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann will reportedly get a significant payout under a deal in which SoftBank will take control of the troubled company. Under the deal, the potential valuation of WeWork would drop to about $8 billion, a stunning fall from its peak of $47 billion, and an additional embarrassment for a company that was supposed to go public not long ago. Under that new expected valuation, SoftBank would have put more money into WeWork to date than the company is worth. Japanese conglomerate SoftBank is the largest investor of The We Company, WeWork's parent company.  Current and former staffers at WeWork are outraged that former CEO and cofounder Adam Neumann would get a massive payout after he all but ran the company into the ground. The golden parachute for Neumann was included in a SoftBank rescue deal, formally announced late Tuesday, that will pump billions more into the embattled company after its failed IPO. Neumann will get the ability to sell up to $970 million in stock back to SoftBank, receive a $500 million loan to repay a credit line, and a $185 million fee for consulting for SoftBank, according to a person familiar with the matter. The bailout leaves Softbank in control of the company and to clean up the mess left behind by Neumann. On September 13, 2019, We Company announced changes to the company's governance to include the ability for the board of directors to pick any new CEO and not having CEO Adam Neumann's family members on the board. Neumann also agreed to transfer to the We Company any profits from his real estate deals with the company. On September 20 it was announced that Wendy Silverstein, the co-head of WeWork's real estate investment fund ARK, had departed the company the week before. Silverstein had joined the company in fall 2018 as a veteran of the New York real estate industry.
