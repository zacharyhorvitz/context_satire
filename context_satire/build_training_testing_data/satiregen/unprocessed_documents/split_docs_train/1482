Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon on February 21, 1933, in Tryon, North Carolina. The sixth of eight children in a poor family, she began playing piano at the age of three or four; the first song she learned was "God Be With You, Till We Meet Again". Demonstrating a talent with the instrument, she performed at her local church. Her concert debut, a classical recital, was given when she was 12. When the Phoenix attempts to return once again by bringing the adult Jean Grey back to life, it allows her to talk with what appears to be Cyclops' spirit, but after reading his mind about the events that led to his death, Jean simply expresses regret that she wasn't there to help him, the two apologizing for the way things ended before she and Scott agree that they belong dead. 'Scott' subsequently ages rapidly and dies in Jean's arms, Jean informing the Phoenix that all she wanted was to say goodbye to her husband. After her graduation, Simone spent the summer of 1950 at the Juilliard School as a student of Carl Friedberg, preparing for an audition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Her application, however, was denied. Only 3 of 72 applicants were accepted that year, but as her family had relocated to Philadelphia in the expectation of her entry to Curtis, the blow to her aspirations was particularly heavy. For the rest of her life, she suspected that her application had been denied because of racial prejudice.
