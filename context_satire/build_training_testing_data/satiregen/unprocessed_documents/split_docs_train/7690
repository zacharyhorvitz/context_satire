 Puerto Rico had archaic roads, bridges and electricity for years -- long before Hurricane Maria. Then the storm devastated the island's transportation and communication networks. President Trump says "broken infrastructure" was to blame for any delayed response by the federal government. Seven in 10 Puerto Ricans still have no power.  San Juan's mayor, Carmen Yulin Cruz, has called a multimillion dollar contract awarded to a small Montana firm to help restore power in Puerto Rico "alarming" and said it should be canceled immediately. "The contract should be voided right away and a proper process which is clear, transparent, legal, moral and ethical should take place," Yulin Cruz said in an interview with Yahoo News Tuesday. Whitefish Energy, a two-year old electrical utility firm with ties to the Trump administration, announced last week it had secured a $300 million contract from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority -- more commonly known as PREPA -- to repair and reconstruct parts of the island's electrical infrastructure. This is the largest contract awarded to any company for relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.  Whitefish Energy, a little-known energy firm based in Montana, has been stirring up controversy ever since it announced last week that it landed a $300 million contract to help restore Puerto Rico's electrical power. The contract is the largest to be awarded since recovery efforts began over a month ago. And several lawmakers on Capitol Hill are calling for government reviews of how this small firm with only two employees at the time Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico was chosen over bigger, more established utilities. The seeds of the deal were first sown after Hurricane Irma, which tore through the Caribbean and Florida in early September.
