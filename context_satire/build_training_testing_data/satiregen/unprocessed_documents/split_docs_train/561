 For some Asian Americans, it's a familiar yet troubling story. Recent articles in The New York Times ("The Asian Advantage") and The Economist ("The Model Minority is Losing Patience") have focused on a racial group considered to be one of the most successful in America and the numbers are compelling. Overall, Asian Americans are more educated: More than half of Asian Americans (51.5%) have a bachelor's degree or higher compared to 30% of the general U.S. population And they earn a lot more: $74,105 in median income versus $53,657, according to Census Bureau's 2014 American Community Survey. But behind the numbers is another story. In 2015, the Iowa Board of Regents selected Bruce Harreld, a business consultant with limited experience in academic administration, to succeed Sally Mason as president. The regents' choice of Harreld provoked criticism and controversy on the UI campus due to his corporate background, lack of history in leading an institution of higher education, and the circumstances related to the search process. The regents said they had based their decision on the belief that Harreld could limit costs and find new sources of revenue beyond tuition in an age of declining state support for universities.  Next week, when Democrats gather for their first televised debate, they are almost certain to discuss the state of America's economy. Because while it may be steadily improving and we are far away from the recessionary times that gripped the country when President Barack Obama took office in 2009, millions of middle-class Americans still feel vulnerable and insecure. Pundits have tried to explain the unrest candidates have encountered out on the campaign trail as an "anti-establishment" sentiment running through the electorate, a sense that he political process is broken. But that is only a small part of the story.
