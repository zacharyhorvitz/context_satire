 The jersey of Michael Sam, the league's first openly gay player, is the No. 2 seller from the NFL draft, according to NFLShop.com. The top selling jersey belongs to Johnny Manziel, the quarterback taken in the first round by the Cleveland Browns. The league's online shop did not release the number of jerseys sold, only the rankings.  Early this year, Michael Sam made news by announcing he is gay. On Saturday, he made history as the first openly gay player to be drafted by a National Football League team. Seconds later, he made waves kissing his boyfriend in celebration as cameras looked on. Now, Sam has one goal in mind -- to make the St. Louis Rams' roster.  President Barack Obama congratulated Michael Sam on Saturday for being the first openly gay football player taken in the National Football League draft,  the White House said in a statement. "From the playing field to the corporate boardroom, LGBT Americans prove everyday that you should be judged by what you do and not who you are," Obama said. He also congratulated the NFL and the St. Louis Rams, the team that drafted Sam. Sam, an All-American defensive end who played for the University of Missouri, made history when he was picked by the Rams in the seventh and final round.
