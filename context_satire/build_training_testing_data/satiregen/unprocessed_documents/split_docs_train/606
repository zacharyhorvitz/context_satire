Harriet Hall of Science-Based Medicine reviewed the film in an article entitled "Does the Movie Fed Up Make Sense?" In the article she states that the film's selection of experts consists mainly of politicians and journalists with few relevant nutritional scientists or doctors. She also argues that the definitive pronouncements that the film makes about the role of sugar are premature as there are too many other possible confounders such as lifestyle, total calorie consumption and the type of foods being eaten. Hall also goes on to provide a comprehensive list of statements that the film claimed were facts but were not based on scientific evidence. Until 1955 the factory made a huge number of cameras that resemble the Leica rather closely. They are often altered, given "Leica" markings and sold as Leicas. However the FED is cruder: for example the rangefinder cam is pointed and not circular as in Leicas. There are differences in the shutter-release buttons and viewfinder windows. In her review for LA Weekly, Amy Nicholson praised the film by saying that "Fed Up is poised to be the Inconvenient Truth of the health movement. (Which makes sense - producer Laurie David worked on both.)" Geoffrey Berkshire in his review for Variety said that "Stephanie Soechtig's documentary effectively gets the message out about America's addiction to unhealthy food." Robert Cameron Fowler from Indiewire in his review said that "'Fed Up' is a glossy package that gets its warnings across loud and clear: we need to change what we eat."
