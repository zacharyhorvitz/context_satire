 In the wake of a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said Thursday that the government has "not done a good job" of preventing those with mental health issues from acquiring guns. "It seems to be common for a lot of these shootings, in fact almost all of the shootings, is the mental state of the people, Grassley told reporters. "And we have not done a very good job of making sure that people that have mental reasons for not being able to handle a gun getting their name into the FBI files and we need to concentrate on that." Kamala Harris, a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, urged people to look at autopsy photographs.  Almost immediately after a gunman in Las Vegas mowed down dozens of people and injured hundreds of concert-goers last fall, there was unprecedented openness among many Republicans in Congress for some kind of gun control legislation. Yet more than four months after the deadliest shooting in modern US history, Congress has yet to send any firearm-related bill aimed to curb gun violence to the President's desk. On Wednesday, 17 people were killed at a Florida high school, invoking the same sense of fury and outrage seen time and time again, as Washington once more became the epicenter for the emotional debate over how to break a continuous loop of massacres. "Can you tell us," California Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson said on the House floor Thursday, as some of his colleagues cheered him on, "when the House may muster the courage to take up the issue of gun violence?"  Remember that big, amendment-laden debate the Senate was preparing for as the world's greatest deliberative body began to grapple with what to do about the nation's broken immigration system? Yeah, it's over. The actual debate over a series of proposals -- a conservative one, a compromise one -- lasted less than a day. Actually, less than an afternoon.
