In the aftermath of the 2019 Virginia Beach shooting, Governor Ralph Northam called for a special session of the Virginia Legislature in order for it to consider different gun-control bills. The House of Delegates reconvened on July 9, 2019 only for it to adjourn again after 90 minutes of session. This decision was made on a party-line vote. Northam expressed his disappointment that no gun-control measures were considered. Term limited out of the 8th District House seat in 2016, Williams ran for Leon County Supervisor of Elections against Mark S. Earley, Leon County Voting Systems Manager, and Tena Pate, the resigning chair of the Florida Commission on Offender Review, following the retirement of Ion Sancho. Pate ran on her experience as the Chair of the Florida Commission on Offender Review. Earley campaigned on his 28 years of technical and leadership expertise in the field, and numerous endorsements from community leaders and local and state politicians, including the retiring Supervisor Ion Sancho. Williams campaigned on his record of community outreach in Tallahassee and actions while serving in the House, and argued that Ion Sancho should not have been allowed to endorse in the race given his position. The Virginia House of Delegates election of 2017 was held on Tuesday, November 7. All 100 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates were contested. The Republican Party held a 66–34 majority in the House of Delegates before the election but lost 15 seats to the Democratic Party, resulting in the Republicans holding a 50–49 advantage. After a recount, the result of the election in the 94th district was called a tie.
