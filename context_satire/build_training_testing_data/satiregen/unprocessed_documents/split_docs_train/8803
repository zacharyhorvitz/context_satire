Non-Christian sources are valuable in two ways. First, they show that even neutral or hostile parties never show any doubt that Jesus actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: that Jesus was a teacher, had a reputation as a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death. It may be to be closer to his wife's family that Pauling left Canada in the early 1870s to return to the United States. He was at 131 Smith Street, Cincinnati from 1873 until at least 1876. By 1878, the family had moved again to Covington, Kentucky where, in addition to the five Paulings, the household also included Fanny Pauling's brother and sister-in-law Alex and Amanda Willis, her sister Harriet Willis, and their niece and nephew Edward and Mollie Masterson. Luke is the only gospel writer to omit the detail of sour wine mix that was offered to Jesus on a reed, while only Mark and John describe Joseph actually taking the body down off the cross.
