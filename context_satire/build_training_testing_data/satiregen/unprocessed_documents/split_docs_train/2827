 US officials are urging calm between Turkey and Iraq to keep the flaring tensions between the two key American allies from jeopardizing the fight against ISIS. The flap over the presence of Turkish troops in northern Iraq, which the government in Baghdad objects to because the forces are there without its permission, could undermine recent gains in the fight against the terror group and disrupt the upcoming effort to retake Mosul. "It is imperative for all parties to coordinate closely over the coming days and weeks to ensure unity of effort in defeating Daesh and to provide for the lasting security of the Iraqi people," State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement issued Tuesday, using another name for ISIS. Kirby however did not mention Turkey by name saying he was addressing "the role that international forces will play in the Iraqi operation to liberate Mosul."  Last week, President Barack Obama held a town hall at which he was asked why he doesn't use the term "Islamic" terrorism. The president's explanation was similar to the one he has given in the past -- groups like ISIS "have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam," he explained. As commander-in-chief he does not "want to validate what they do" and potentially alienate Muslim allies in the fight against them. The president is right.  "We cover the children at night when they sleep," said Khalil. His hands were stained black, the air in the entrance to his house thick with smoke. Khalil, his wife and five children live but a minute's walk from a blazing oil well, one of more than a dozen ISIS has set alight in recent months. His two-year-old son Obaida watched us warily.
