 The National Weather Service is not mincing words about powerful Hurricane Matthew. The agency's Melbourne, Florida, office warned Thursday night that homes and buildings in central Florida "may be uninhabitable for weeks or months." The dire warning is similar to one sent just before Hurricane Katrina plowed into the Gulf Coast in 2005, CNN Senior Meteorologist Dave Hennen said. "Extremely dangerous, life-threatening weather conditions are forecast in the next 12 to 24 hours," the weather service warned.  Haiti braced for a pounding Monday night as Hurricane Matthew slowly, powerfully spun across the Caribbean Sea. The storm packing 145-mph winds has killed at least three people, caused cruise ships to change course and prompted the governors of Florida and North Carolina to declare states of emergency for coastal areas. Rain and wind thrashed Haiti on Monday night and up to 40 inches of rain could be dumped on the impoverished nation still recovering from a 2010 earthquake. "This rainfall will likely produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides," the US National Hurricane Center said.  Gas lines in Florida. Traffic jams on South Carolina highways. Tourists in North Carolina told to pack. Hurricane Matthew's outer bands weren't even close to the United States on Tuesday, but the powerful storm's potential path was already causing headaches, triggering a hurricane warning for parts of Florida.
