 Like many over-scheduled 14-year-old girls, Presley Chandler has a very busy daily routine. But hers is probably busier than most. Presley, an eighth-grader in Crookston, Minnesota, has two-hour figure skating classes at least three days a week, not counting the hours she practices on her own. She spends nearly her entire day on the rink each Sunday.  Jana Pittman was the woman to beat in track and field's 400-meter hurdles for nearly a decade, only to suffer crushing disappointment as a string of injuries wrecked her chances of Olympic gold. It must have been tempting to step out of the sporting limelight -- but Pittman did exactly the opposite. Instead she took up the white knuckle sport of bobsleigh, and is making Olympic history in Sochi by becoming the first Australian woman to compete in both the Summer and now Winter Games. Less than 18 months after her first "terrifying" run on an ice course, Pittman says she is "extraordinarily lucky" to be part of a team in the two-woman event with experienced driver Astrid Radjenovic.  Bob Costas gamely anchored NBC's Winter Olympics coverage for five days despite a worsening eye infection and a whole lot of concerned comments from viewers. But Tuesday, Costas said that he would step aside, at least for a night, putting a hiccup into his 14-year Olympic anchoring streak. "Today" show host Matt Lauer will anchor NBC's prime time coverage of the Sochi games during his absence. "I was trying to throw a complete game here, but I think we're going to have to go to the bullpen," Costas told "Today" show viewers by phone early Tuesday.
