 Former Vice President Dick Cheney will headline House Republicans' biggest annual fundraising dinner next month, the National Republican Congressional Committee announced Wednesday. In a statement, NRCC chairman Greg Walden called Cheney, who served under George W. Bush, "a dedicated public servant" and "true patriot." "The Vice President has worked tirelessly to protect our freedom and improve the lives of all Americans during his time, both in the House of Representatives and the White House," Walden said. "We are grateful for all of his hard work and all he continues to do for both our country and party," Walden added. If it were possible for the working classes, by combining among themselves, to raise or keep up the general rate of wages, it needs hardly be said that this would be a thing not to be punished, but to be welcomed and rejoiced at. Unfortunately the effect is quite beyond attainment by such means. The multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all, much more to combine effectually. If they could do so, they might doubtless succeed in diminishing the hours of labour, and obtaining the same wages for less work.  Jeb Bush on Wednesday introduced the core principles of an economic platform that could become the central tenant of an eventual presidential campaign. In a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, the former Florida governor tapped into the struggles of "too many Americans (who) live on the edge of economic ruin," debuting what Bush dubbed a "new vision" to create more economic opportunity in the U.S. and give Americans "the right to rise." "The recovery has been everywhere but in American paychecks. The American Dream has become a mirage for far too many.
