The "Invictus Education Trust" is the academy to which The Crestwood School, Leasowes High School, Ounsdale High School, Ellowes Sports College  and Kinver High School  are all part of. The Sixth form is governed by Mr A S Griffiths. The Invictus Trust was created in March 2015 by the founding schools: Crestwood School, Ounsdale High School, Ellowes Sports College and Kinver High School with Leasowes joining in Autumn 2016. The word Invictus by defenition means ‘indomitable or unconquerable’. In December 2006, an F2 tornado tore through the back area of the high school. There was no serious or irreparable damage done to the section. The roof of the high school gym collapsed while the girls' basketball team was inside, but no one was hurt. The fire escape is exposed to the sniper's gunfire, so they force open the lift door. It is boobytrapped with a shotgun, however, which kills Jeff. Becky, Kurtis, and Paul climb down the lift shaft, but discover the ground-floor exit door has been blocked with a skip and return to the top floor. Jenny suggests the emoticons symbolise the three wise monkeys and that the sniper is targeting them because they let Jimmy be killed and refused to speak to the police about it.
