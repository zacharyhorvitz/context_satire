 President Donald Trump was looking to flatter his new friend in Singapore when he struck upon an unusual compliment. He had known plenty of people who had grown up wealthy and whose families were powerful, Trump told Kim Jong Un, the despotic North Korean dictator whose father and grandfather held the same role. Many of them emerged messed up, Trump said. But, he added, Kim wasn't one of them.  It can be hard in this communist capital to avoid vestiges of the conflict known here as the American War. The Hanoi Hilton, a ruefully nicknamed prison, is the city's main tourist site. The Metropole Hotel, Hanoi's finest, has an underground bomb shelter that's been restored for tours. Yet President Donald Trump, who is of the age to have served in the war but did not, seemed less taken with the historic symbols Wednesday than with his long-simmering dispute with a Democratic senator, who he has accused of manufacturing his wartime credentials.  Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said his country will "spare no effort" to host a successful summit between North Korea and the United States because in the end, it would be less costly than a war. "For the peace of the world, for a connected and developed world, let's shake hands. We shall develop together and contribute to global stability," Nguyen told CNN. In an international exclusive interview with CNN, Nguyen -- the second in line of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party -- said that the country hopes to play more than just host to US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but rather prove itself as an example of the benefits of peace, reconciliation and market liberalization.
