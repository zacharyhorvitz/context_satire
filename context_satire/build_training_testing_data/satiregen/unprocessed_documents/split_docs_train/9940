White House Press Secretary Tony Snow announced on June 23, 2006, that Mineta would resign effective July 7, 2006, because "he wanted to", with a spokesman for Mineta saying he was "moving on to pursue other challenges". He left office as the longest-serving Secretary of Transportation in history. In November 2001, the airport was renamed after Norman Y. Mineta, a native of San Jose, its former mayor and congressman, as well as both a former United States Secretary of Commerce and a United States Secretary of Transportation. That same month, the San Jose City Council approved an amended master plan for the airport that called for a three-phase, nine-year expansion plan. The plan, designed by Gensler and The Steinberg Group, called for a single, consolidated "Central Terminal" with 40 gates (four more than present), an international concourse and expanded security areas. The sail-shaped facade would greet up to 17.6 million passengers a year. In May 2014, Secretary Mineta was a guest speaker at a conference called "The Color of Citizenship." The conference consisted of discussions revolving around the internment of Japanese Americans during World War 2 and a comparison with the New York City Police Department's Stop and Frisk Policy following the 2001   terrorist attacks in America (specifically how the policy targeted the Sikh community). Mineta spoke at the Roosevelt House at Hunter College in New York in regards to these issues.
