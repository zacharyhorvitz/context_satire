Beginning with the 1997 launch of its first one-hour dramatic narrative series Oz, HBO started a trend that became commonplace with premium cable services. While the show was critically acclaimed, it was not until The Sopranos premiered in 1999, that the network achieved widespread critical success for an hour-long series. The Sopranos—centering on mob patriarch Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) and his family—received 111 Emmy nominations during its six-season run, resulting in 21 wins, two of them for Outstanding Drama Series.

Pleper cited that he feels that binge watching does not correlate with the culture of HBO and HBO watchers.
