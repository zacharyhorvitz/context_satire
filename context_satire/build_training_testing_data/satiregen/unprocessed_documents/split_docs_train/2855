On MSNBC, Todd Akin opposes evolution. He was running for the senate seat in Missouri at the time. He has said "I take a look at both sides of the thing and it seems to me that evolution takes a tremendous amount of faith. I don't even see it as a matter of science because I don't know if you can prove....". Many members of Field's creative team on In the Bedroom returned to work with him on the film, including Serena Rathbun. In a 2006 interview with The Hollywood Reporter's Anne Thompson, Field said Rathbun was the reason he quit acting and began making his own films after she told him to "Do what you want to do. Don't get distracted." Later that year on the Charlie Rose show, Field spoke extensively about the importance of Rathbun as his creative partner,  describing a conversation he had with her where she gave him the most pivotal scene, “for me, the film is unthinkable without it.” In July 2018 Bulatao was nominated for the position of Under Secretary of State for Management as the successor to William E. Todd. In May 2019 Senator Bob Menendez lifted the almost year-long hold he had placed on the confirmation as soon as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo promised to send to the Senate documentation relating to allegations that "Trump administration political appointees at the State Department had sought to remove or reassign career employees who were seen as hostile to Trump’s agenda." During the nomination hearings, Bulatao said that if he were confirmed, he would not tolerate "political litmus tests" in the department.
