In the early 1970s, a story was widely reported that Leave It to Beaver star Ken Osmond had become "rock star Alice Cooper". According to Cooper, the rumor began when a college newspaper editor asked him what kind of child he was, to which Cooper replied, "I was obnoxious, disgusting, a real Eddie Haskell," referring to the fictional character Osmond portrayed. However, the editor ended up reporting that Cooper was the real Haskell. Cooper later told the New Times, "It was the biggest rumor that ever came out about me. Cooper was born on September 8, 1992 in Fayetteville, North Carolina to Kimberly Gibson (née Johnson), a culinary teacher and the late Gene Cooper, a drill sergeant for the United States Army.
