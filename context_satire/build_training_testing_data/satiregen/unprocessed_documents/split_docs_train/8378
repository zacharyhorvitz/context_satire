 The latest, last-ditch effort by Senate Republicans to overturn the Affordable Care Act -- the so-called "skinny repeal" --  gives Democrats a golden opportunity to begin redefining their party as a reliable champion of the bread-and-butter economic issues that working-class voters care about. Republican attempts to dismantle Obamacare have ground to a near halt as the nation absorbs the implications of undoing the current law's dense web of federal subsidies of medical services that insurers are legally required to cover. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, ripping away the subsidies and loosening mandatory requirements could add 16 million people to the rolls of the uninsured. But Republican leaders are determined to press ahead, using a strategy that treats repeal efforts as a budgetary matter, which, under Senate rules, requires passage by a simple 50-vote majority rather than an all-but-impossible 60 votes. President Manuel Roxas, to give relief to the people who were facing difficulties in the post-war period, called on the legislators to create a social security program in his State of the Nation Address in January 1948 but he died without passing the bill.  Most people expect to spend less money after they retire. But that might not be the case -- at least not at first. Spending rose for more than half of taxpayers during the first three years after claiming Social Security, according to a report based on tax data and analyzed by economists at the Investment Company Institute and the IRS. Those with lower incomes were most likely to be spending more than they were pre-retirement.
