 President Donald Trump plans to "revisit" his administration's decision on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program if Congress is unable to pass legislation on the issue within six months, he announced in a tweet Tuesday night. "Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't, I will revisit this issue!" Trump wrote.  When the time came for the Trump administration to announce it was ending DACA on Tuesday, there was a familiar face at the podium. But it wasn't the President, it was Attorney General Jeff Sessions. It's no surprise to anyone who has followed Sessions' career that he would take an opportunity to criticize DACA or announce its end. But President Donald Trump's outsourcing of the official announcement to Sessions was evidence of how central a role the attorney general played in the decision to end the program -- and Trump's aversion to announcing that decision himself.  President Donald Trump continues to weigh phasing out a program that has protected young undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children -- with a decision to sunset the program possible as early as this week. The administration has been reviewing its options on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for months -- opting to continue the Obama administration policy when it took office despite Trump's bellicose campaign rhetoric. The review has intensified in recent weeks, as an ultimatum looms after Labor Day to force the administration's hand. Trump is said to be weighing two options on DACA that would continue protections, but would prevent future applicants and possibly renewals of the two-year permits, according to a source close to the White House and Congress.
