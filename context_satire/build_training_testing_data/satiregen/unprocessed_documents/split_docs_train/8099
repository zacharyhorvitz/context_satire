KVII-TV currently broadcasts the full ABC network schedule, with the only programming preemptions being the ABC News Brief seen during ABC Daytime programming, and situations in which preemption of the network's daytime and prime time programs is necessary to allow the main channel to provide extended coverage of breaking news or severe weather events (in some instances, these programs may either be rebroadcast on KVII on tape delay in place of the station's regular overnight programming, however, cable and satellite subscribers have the option of watching the affected shows on ABC's desktop and mobile streaming platforms or its cable/satellite video-on-demand service the day after their initial airing). The station carries the network's Sunday morning political/news discussion program This Week via its Eastern Time Zone feed (at 8:00 a.m.), due to its broadcast of the Sinclair-produced investigative news program Full Measure and locally based Quail Creek Church's weekly televised services. Concurrent to Cannan Communications's purchase of KAMR, in 1974, the station adopted the Action News format, which allowed it to feature more stories within its newscasts than those seen on KVII and KFDA due to strict time limits on story packages. In October 1990, as part of a major re-imaging of the station, KAMR retitled its newscasts from Action News 4 to News 4. However, these changes — as well as the adoption of "Straight Facts, Straight to You" as its news slogan (which was also used by fellow NBC affiliate KMOL-TV  in San Antonio during the time period) — did little to improve the station's mediocre local news ratings, which had slid from second place during 1989 to an ever-more-distant third by the November 1990 sweeps period; KFDA, which had long rated at third place in local news, overtook KAMR for the #2 spot. (KFDA would surge to first place by the end of the 1990s.) A news outsourcing agreement was established between KCIT and KAMR two years later, resulting in the return of a nightly prime time newscast to channel 14, which made its debut on March 11, 2001. The half-hour show, titled Fox 14 News @ 9, originated from a secondary news set at KAMR/KCIT/KCPN's facility on South Fillmore Street in downtown Amarillo. Originally co-anchored by Kelly James and Paige Smith (née Cook) on Sundays through Friday nights and Mel Hernandez on Saturdays, the newscast was structured to match the "Fox attitude" in an effort to court younger viewers, incorporating entertainment, health and lifestyle news segments and a fast-paced sports segment (similar in pacing to that of the Headline Sports segment aired at the time by CNN Headline News), alongside a conventional style of news coverage that would appeal to Texas Panhandle viewers.
