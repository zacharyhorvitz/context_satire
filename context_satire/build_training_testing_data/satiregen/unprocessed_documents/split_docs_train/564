 A diversity paradox looms over the Democrats' hopes of recapturing the White House in 2020. The field of Democratic presidential candidates includes the most racial minorities ever, and more minorities will likely vote next year in the party's primaries than ever before. Yet four white contenders consistently lead in state and national polls, partly because of the outsized influence of the two virtually all-white states that lead off the election calendar, Iowa and New Hampshire. Those four white contenders -- former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens.  Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick told friends and allies in phone calls on Wednesday that he has made a decision to run for president, two people familiar with the matter say. Plans for the timing of his formal announcement were still in flux Wednesday, with attention on impeachment, but a source familiar with the plans tells CNN that Patrick will officially file for the New Hampshire primary on Thursday in Concord after he appears on "CBS This Morning." The odds could be incredibly steep for a late entrant like Patrick, who is not well known nationally and does not have personal wealth to finance a campaign.  CNN and The Des Moines Register will release their fifth Iowa poll on Saturday, providing a look as to where 2020 presidential candidates stand in the crucial early voting state less than three months ahead of the Iowa caucuses. The results of the CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll will be released at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday. A clear leader has yet to emerge among the large field of Democratic contenders in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.
