Jensen and his brother Luke both attended the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California. After two years playing for the USC Trojans, Murphy transferred to the University of Georgia for one year and then turned professional to pursue a career in tennis and to join his brother Luke on the ATP Tour. According to the book In a Different Key: The Story of Autism (2016), Leo Kanner's original 1943 paper stated that "the child's aloneness" was evident "from the very beginning of life." Furthermore, he drew a contrast between autism and schizophrenia, in that autism was part of a child's constitution whereas schizophrenia developed later in life. Murphy Jensen grew up on a Christmas-tree farm in the summer resort town of Ludington in western Michigan. He first saw a tennis net being used to corral salmon along the Pere Marquette River as a boy. His father (whom tried out with the New York Giants as an offensive guard and then became a high school tennis coach) Howard Jensen, taught Murphy and brother Luke to play tennis before they were 5 years old.
