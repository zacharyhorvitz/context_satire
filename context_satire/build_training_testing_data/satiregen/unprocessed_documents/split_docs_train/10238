 President Donald Trump used a solemn address from the White House on Monday to call for unity in the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, calling the massacre an "act of pure evil." The gun attack on a country music festival Sunday in Las Vegas killed at least 50 people and injured more than 400 others. In a subdued statement, Trump said the nation was united "in sadness, shock and grief." Reading from a teleprompter in the Diplomatic Reception Room, Trump mourned the victims and announced he would visit the stricken Nevada city on Wednesday.  President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the US will "be talking about gun laws as time goes by" in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, the nation's deadliest in modern history. "Look, we have a tragedy ... and what happened in Las Vegas is in many ways a miracle. The police department has done such an incredible job," Trump said at the White House before he left for Puerto Rico. The President was asked about a gun bill currently making its way through the House that would loosen restrictions on purchasing gun silencers.  White House press secretary Sarah Sanders grew emotional on Monday as she spoke about those who were killed in Las Vegas but dismissed questions about gun rights as too political in the wake of the tragedy. The gun attack on a country music festival Sunday in Las Vegas killed more than 50 people and injured more than 500 others. After listing the many acts of heroism during the shooting, Sanders choked up reflecting on how those men and women who lost their lives will be remembered. "The Gospel of John reminds us that there is no greater love than to lay down one's life for a friend," she said during the White House press briefing.
