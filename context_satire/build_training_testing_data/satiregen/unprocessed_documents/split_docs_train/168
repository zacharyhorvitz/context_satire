 No one hopes Hurricane Sandy lives up to its potential. The storm that has already claimed nearly two dozen lives in the Caribbean churned Friday near the northern Bahamas, and meteorologists warn that it packs the potential to slam the U.S. Northeast as soon as Monday with powerful winds and pelting rain. Worst case, Sandy could merge with a strong cold front from the west. The double threat could morph into a "superstorm" that could sit over New England for days, making untold trouble for millions of residents.  After largely escaping the wrath of Irene last year, coastal towns got walloped by Sandy this week. Cleanup costs are expected to run into multiple millions of dollars, as municipalities try to deal with flooding, downed trees and damage to their waterfronts. The destruction that Sandy wrought this week was far harsher than last year's storm, officials say. "This was a thousand times worse," said Matthew Doherty, mayor of Belmar, N.J., which lost half of its 1.2-mile boardwalk on the Atlantic Ocean.  Pockets of frustration among cold and hungry residents festered Friday in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, even as other areas sputtered back to life. The biggest challenges in places like New Jersey and Staten Island -- where the majority of New York's storm-related deaths were recorded -- include food and electricity shortages. Across 15 states and the District of Columbia, utilities reported that about 3.3 million customers remained without power. Some may stay in the dark for at least another week, reported area utility companies PSE&G and LIPA, the Long Island Power Authority.
