There was always a certain amount of trouble  until I came into motor racing. And in one of the first races I ever took part in there was a list of people when they put the practice times  and I heard somebody say, 'Mosley, Max Mosley, he must be some relation of Alf Mosley, the coachbuilder.' And I thought to myself, 'I've found a world where they don't know about Oswald Mosley.' And it has always been a bit like that in motor racing: nobody gives a damn. Mosley has a street named after him in downtown Wichita, so named by James Mead, who admired Mosley most out of all frontier traders. Mead described him as "a large, strong man with clear blue eyes and locks of black hair dangling to his shoulders - the most perfect specimen of physical manhood I ever saw." In 1969, after two large accidents due to breakages on his Lotus car, Mosley decided that "it was evident that I wasn't going to be World Champion" and retired from driving. He was already working with Robin Herd, Alan Rees and Graham Coaker to establish the racing car manufacturer March Engineering where he handled legal and commercial matters. The name March is an acronym based on the initials of the founders; the 'M' stands for Mosley. Like the other founders, Mosley put in Â£2,500 of capital.
