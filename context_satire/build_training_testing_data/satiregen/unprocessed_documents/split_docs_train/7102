 Donald Trump predicted Thursday his new nickname will be "Mr. Brexit." "They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT," tweeted the Republican presidential nominee, who in June compared his campaign to the British movement to leave the European Union. Trailing his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in every major, recent national poll, Trump might be dreaming of his own Brexit-style upset.  The contortions are starting to get uncomfortable. New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte, locked in a tight bid for re-election, has criticized her party's nominee for President and says she will not endorse him. However, she does plan to vote for him. "While he has my vote, he doesn't have my endorsement," she said of Donald Trump this week.  On Thursday night, Donald Trump did the unthinkable. Sometimes, he admitted, I say "the wrong thing." But Trump wants you to know he "regrets it ... particularly where it may have caused too much personal pain." At the end of the day, though, his apology doesn't matter.
