Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, The Fate of the Furious, and Despicable Me 3 have each grossed over $1 billion, and are ranked as the 14th-, 17th-, 19th-, and 38th-highest-grossing films of all time, with the latter being the 8th-highest-grossing animated film. Split, by M. Night Shyamalan, was the year's most profitable film in terms of return on investment (ROI), having generated over 2,000% ROI. It is the 11th film to cross 2,000% ROI, and the first film to do so since 2015. Notes: * Cara & Stephanie Berline became the first set of twins to compete on Wipeout. John Henson can't tell which is which, so when John Anderson said that Stephanie was starting the course, John Henson said that Cara's at the start again. Cara and Stephanie are twins. ** First person to cross the Log Roll successfully.
