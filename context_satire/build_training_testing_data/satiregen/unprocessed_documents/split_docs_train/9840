Space hoppers were introduced to the United Kingdom in 1969. The Cambridge Evening News newspaper, England, contained an advertisement for the hopper in November of that year and described it as a trend. The space hopper became a major craze for several years, and remained widely popular through the 1980s. They are sometimes considered a symbol of the 1970s. The Hopper was critically praised by various technology publications; PC Magazine gave the Hopper an "Excellent" rating of 4.5 out of 5, concluding that "It only has three tuners to the TiVo Elite's four and it doesn't suggest and automatically populate your DVR schedule based on your watching habits, but its price, clean design, and easy support for multi-room DVR make it a must-have for Dish Network subscribers." Engadget was similarly positive; despite noticing issues with certain aspects of its user interface, "all that being said, things will get much more interesting when other providers get on the whole-home DVR game and start to offer as many TV anywhere options as Dish, but for now the Hopper offers some unique, desirable features that you just can't get anywhere else." At a "Future of Video" hearing with the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology on June 27, 2012, Charlie Ergen made further remarks defending the legality of the Hopper and AutoHop, stating that the service " nothing more than improving upon existing, legally accepted, and widely available technologies". He also remarked that with the feature, "allowing your kids to watch TV doesnâ€™t have to mean they have no choice but to see commercials for junk food and alcohol." The next day, Michael Petricone of the Consumer Electronics Association spoke to the subcommittee, likening Hopper to earlier time shifting devices, and stating that the device would encourage people to watch TV more.
