In 1997, Traverse City Senior High, the largest high school in Michigan at the time, was split by the school district into two distinct high schools due to extreme overcrowding. Prior to opening, a contest was held to determine the school colors, school name, and school mascot. Top mascot contenders included the Titans, Bison (due to the abundance of buffalo farms on Traverse City's west side) and Dogmen (after a popular cryptid of Northern Michigan). The newly constructed Traverse City West Senior High School was opened, while the original high school facility was renamed as Traverse City Central High School. Traverse City West Senior High (also known as West High School or simply West) is a public high school in Traverse City, Michigan, located at 5376 N. Long Lake Road. The principal is Joe Esper who took over the role in December 2014, after Joseph Tibaldi retired. Tibaldi had been the principal since the school's opening in 1997. Traverse City West is one of three public high schools in Traverse City, with nearly 2,000 students each year. In 2018, TCAPS has three vacant properties around the Traverse City Area. It is unknown if these properties are to become schools, but TCAPS has expressed feelings of building a new district headquarters, replacing the old Boardman Building in Traverse City. Also in 2018, Old Mission School became an independent district, further lowering the number of elementary schools in the district.
