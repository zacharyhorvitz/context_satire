In Dirty Harry we learn that Callahan's unnamed wife has recently died, her picture still on display in his apartment. In Magnum Force he begins a relationship with Sunny, an Asian woman who is one of his neighbors and asks to go to bed with him on their first meeting. In Sudden Impact he establishes a sexual relationship with vigilante Jennifer Spencer although it is uncertain if this goes any further, with Spencer commenting 'Neither of us want to be alone tonight'. The Dead Pool implies a romantic relationship with news reporter Samantha Walker, and the film ends with her and Callahan walking away together. The former phrase was borrowed by US President Ronald Reagan in a March 1985 speech to the American Business Conference. Promising to veto any proposed tax rises, he challenged those who wanted them to: "Go ahead, make my day." It has also given its name to a law in Colorado, the Make My Day Law, which protects homeowners who use lethal force against intruders. Upon arriving in sleepy San Paulo, Callahan chases down a would-be robber. The reckless hot pursuit, with the bank robber riding a hijacked Honda CX-500 motorcycle modified with a police parking meter service box and Callahan driving a commandeered GMC minibus with an AmTran passenger body carrying a group of senior citizens, draws the anger of the local police. While jogging with his bulldog Meathead, Callahan accidentally runs into Jennifer Spencer. She is less than thrilled, but feels no extreme anger toward him.
