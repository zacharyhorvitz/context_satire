The case was brought by groups such as the California Democratic Party and the National Rifle Association, and individuals including U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell, then the Senate Majority Whip, who argued that the legislation was an unconstitutional infringement on their First Amendment rights. Senator McConnell had been a longtime opponent of BCRA in the Senate, and had led several Senate filibusters to block its passage.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer engaged in dueling statements on Friday over health care, one day after the two men expressed hope of more cooperation in a joint interview. The two leaders struck a tone of bipartisanship in a joint interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper Thursday night at the Congressional Baseball Game, though they stressed they still had their policy differences. Those differences were amplified Friday when Schumer sent a letter Friday requesting an all-senators meeting in the Old Senate Chamber next week. Senate Democrats have been blasting Republicans for deliberating the health care bill behind closed doors, saying they've only been learning of the ongoing negotiations through media reports.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer blasted the Republican plans to repeal and replace Obamacare and kicked off a series of procedural moves for Democrats to take in order to hold the Senate floor Monday night in protest. Democrats' coordinated effort doesn't actually stall any work that's being done on the bill; it's considered more a night of theatrics for Democrats. But Democrats are attempting to draw attention to the behind-closed-door process that Republicans are taking in drafting the bill. Democrats are mostly hitting Republicans for not holding open hearings as the bill is being drawn up.
