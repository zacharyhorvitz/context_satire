The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 3 stars stating "Sounding at times like Charlie Parker (with touches of Phil Woods and Jackie McLean), Jenkins easily keeps up with his better-known sidemen and plays the boppish music with plenty of creativity, emotion, and excitement. After listening to the high-quality set, one wonders why Jenkins did not make it". The story in the programme follows this pattern: Jenkins convinces his band to do a one off benefit gig to raise money to purchase better lighting in the street surrounding the Theatre. During the run up to the gig the band lose the location of the venue while out in the groups Reliant Robin. As a result,  the audience are left waiting. Bandleader Billy Jenkins argues with the band and bass player Thad Kelly walks out.  Growing up in Japan, musician Oki Kano never knew he was part of a "vanishing people." His Japanese mother was divorced and never told Kano that his birth father was an indigenous Ainu man. Kano was 20 years old when he found out. For decades, researchers and conservative Japanese politicians described the Ainu as  "vanishing," says Jeffry Gayman, an Ainu peoples researcher at Hokkaido University.
