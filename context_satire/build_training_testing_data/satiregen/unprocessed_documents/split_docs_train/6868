After eliminating Danni, Adam sought to unite the new school players against Rob, Parvati, and Ethan, who he felt were running the tribe. Denise felt secure about her position in the tribe thanks to an extra fire token from Danni and her full idol (Adam had returned his half to her). At Dakal, the tribe continued to flourish thanks to Sandra netting a shark. Despite this, Tyson worked to gather numbers against Sandra in an attempt to get back on the plus side of the numbers. Ethan is eliminated from the challenge earlier by accidentally stepping off a post. Lex and Kim J. continue for several hours, but Lex, who has been feeling ill for the few days, stumbles, and Kim J. wins immunity. At the following Tribal, she votes to eliminate Lex and go into the jury with Ethan. At the final Tribal Council, the jury quizzed Ethan and Kim J. over their gameplay. Months later, Jeff was on at a CBS studio in Los Angeles (with a live audience) along with a voting urn and, when he returned, it appeared he had returned directly to the tribal council site to read the votes. In reality, the CBS sound stage was made up to look like the site. This was revealed after he read the votes and Ethan was named Sole Survivor with a 5-2 vote, Ethan receiving Kelly, Frank, Teresa, Big Tom, and Lex's votes and Kim J. getting Brandon and Kim P.'s. Prior to appearing in the finale, the contestants were told to make themselves appear as they had looked during the last tribal council and, during the reading of the votes, the audience was told to hold any cheering or applause until after the winner was announced.
