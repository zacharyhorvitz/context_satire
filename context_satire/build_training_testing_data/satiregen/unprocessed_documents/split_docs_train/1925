On August 20, 2012, Whelchel was announced as a contestant in Survivor: Philippines as a member of the Tandang tribe. She joined retired Major League Baseball star Jeff Kent as one of the season's two "celebrity" contestants. She elected to keep her true identity, as a former television star, a secret from the other contestants, many of whom were too young to have watched The Facts of Life during its original run and thus did not recognize her. Two years later The Power and the Myth was finished but it was 2004 before it was released by Frontiers Records. The album marked the return of Chuck Wright, Lanny Cordola and Ken Mary, but is the first not to feature Giuffria, who had left the project with keyboard work done by guests Derek Sherinian, Allan Okuye, Sven Martin and Ricky Phillips. Directly after The Power and the Myth was released, Christian released his second solo CD, Meet The Man. House of Lords contacted Jeff Kent to take over the writing of lyrics and melodies due to the band's lowest scores since its inception. In addition, growing tension that had been developing between Kent and Bonds for years finally boiled over: a midseason fight in the Giants dugout was widely reported in 2002 and caught on television. The feud between the two was so bad, that at the end of the season, San Francisco Chronicle beat reporter Ray Ratto said of the two, "The one who lives longer will attend the other's funeral, just to make sure he's dead." The departure of manager Dusty Baker also factored into Kent's eventual decision to leave the Giants. Kent signed a two-year, $19.9Â million deal with the Houston Astros, citing his desire to be closer to his family's Texas ranch.
