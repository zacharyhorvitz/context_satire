 For the first time since announcing former NFL star Aaron Hernandez's CTE diagnosis in September, Boston University neuropathologist Dr. Ann McKee shared the findings from Hernandez's brain autopsy on Thursday. McKee and her team have examined more than 100 former NFL players' brains for the neurodegenerative disease, formally named chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and found Hernandez's case to be significant. "This is the first case that we've seen that kind of damage in such a young individual," she said, adding that the type of brain damage observed is usually seen in someone 20 years older. Hernandez was 27 years old when he fatally hanged himself in prison in April. The Boston Political Review is BU's premier on-campus political magazine. Founded in the spring of 2014, the BPR publishes an online edition every month, with a range of subjects including national, global, and local politics as well as sections on lobbying, social issues, and economics. The BPR prints their highlighted articles and new material once every semester in a free print magazine that is distributed around campus. Their mission is to offer Boston University students, alumni, staff, and faculty the chance to read a balanced political magazine that offers arguments from all points of view on the political spectrum. The independently run student newspaper at Boston University, The Daily Free Press, as well as The New York Times, have published articles exploring the existence of grade deflation. The Times discovered that administrators have suggested to faculty members deflated ideal grade distributions. Although an article in the official publication BU Today asserted that "the GPAs of BU undergrads and the percentage of As and Bs have both risen over the last two decades", The New York Times has found BU grades have been rising more slowly with respect to many other schools.
