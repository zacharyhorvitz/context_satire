In April 2015, Anheuser-Busch, in an effort to target new, younger consumers to buy its products, the company printed a slogan on Bud Light bottles that said "The perfect beer for removing 'no' from your vocabulary for the night. #UpForWhatever." The label triggered a backlash, and the company was immediately criticized by people who charged that it could be interpreted as promoting rape. Alexander Lambrecht, Vice President of Anheuser-Busch, later apologized in a statement for the bottle tagline, saying that the message "missed the mark" and that they would never "condone disrespectful or irresponsible behavior." It is said that after one particularly satisfying victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, Mutrie (who was also the team's manager) stormed into the dressing room and exclaimed, "My big fellows! My giants!" From then on (1885), the club was known as the Giants. However, more recent research has suggested that the New York World was already widely using the Giants nickname throughout the 1885 season, before the legendary game was played. Born Eagles Forest in Neshaminy State Park, Swoop was a bald eagle with poor eyesight and strength, but a "strong and true" heart. The bird gained a humanoid appearance and size after a Philadelphia Eagles fan gave him a jersey that increased his strength, and his vision grew to match his heart. Hoping to help others, he became an overseer of the Eagles community.
