 April 18, 2013 Media Literacy Question of the Day How should news organizations deal with rapidly changing information during times of breaking news? * * Daily Discussion Questions What do you know about Monday's terror bombing at the Boston Marathon? What could you do to ensure that you have the most recent information and that it is accurate? Why would this be important? Contrary to widespread reporting, no arrest has been made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate. Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.  Investigators are tracking down some two-thousand leads this morning in their search for information regarding the Boston Marathon bombings. There are also new reports this morning that Boston-area hospitals have released at least 100 of the 183 people injured in Monday's attack. New details about the lives of the three people killed including a Chinese graduate student who was studying at Boston University are coming out as well. This morning Congressman Patrick Meehan (R-PA) joins “Starting Point.” Meehan serves as the chair of the House Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee and was briefed about the Boston Marathon bombing on Monday.
