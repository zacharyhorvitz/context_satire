According to a consultant hired by plaintiffs in a sex discrimination lawsuit, in 2001, Wal-Mart's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filings showed that female employees made up 65 percent of Wal-Mart's hourly paid workforce, but only 33 percent of its management. Just 35 percent of its store managers were women, compared to 57 percent at similar retailers. Wal-Mart says comparisons with other retailers are unfair, because it classifies employees differently; if department managers were included in the totals, women would make up 60 percent of the managerial ranks. Others have criticized the lawsuit as without basis in the law and as an abuse of the class action mechanism. For Thanksgiving 2013, CNN estimates that approximately a million United States Walmart employees will work over the course of the holiday, with big specials starting at 6:00 pm on Thanksgiving Day. The company states that employees will receive "a nice Thanksgiving dinner at work," extra "holiday pay," and 25% discount off one purchase, regardless of how many items are purchased at that time. According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the extra holiday pay equals the average daily shift the employee worked during the previous two weeks. Walmart is also expanding its one-hour guarantee from three items last year to twenty-one items this year. Walmart is the world's largest company by revenue, with US$514.405 billion, according to the Fortune Global 500 list in 2019. It is also the largest private employer in the world with 2.2 million employees. It is a publicly traded family-owned business, as the company is controlled by the Walton family. Sam Walton's heirs own over 50 percent of Walmart through their holding company Walton Enterprises and through their individual holdings.
