Josh Parker and Tiffany Henderson are childhood friends who became high school sweethearts, but when he enrolls at the University of Ithaca and she enrolls at the University of Austin (both of which are fictional), they have to deal with a long-distance relationship. They promise continued fidelity to one another; however, when Josh loses touch with Tiffany, he believes she might be seeing other people. Nonetheless, he makes regular recorded video tapes to mail to her. Josh asks Rubin to mail his tape to Tiffany before leaving for class. The next morning, Josh arrives in the room in a very jovial mood, confessing that he slept with Beth. His friends play his tape but Josh discovers that Rubin accidentally mailed the sex tape to Tiffany, having confused it with the other tape. Josh then receives a voicemail from Tiffany saying that she did not call him because her grandfather had died and she will be away from school until Monday. Accompanied by E.L. and Rubin, Josh asks Kyle to tag along, mainly because he needs Kyle's car. The group finally gets to Austin and, once they get to Tiffany's dorm, Josh eventually intercepts the tape he sent to Tiffany, who has just arrived back at school. However, Earl shows up, furious over what happened with the car and the credit card and threatens to drag Kyle back home with him. Kyle finally summons the confidence to stand up to him and states that he is going back to school with his friends. Earl assaults him and confusion reigns in an all-out mini-riot in the dorm's lobby.
