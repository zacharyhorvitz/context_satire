Howie Do It was a Canadian/American comedy television series, co-commissioned by Global and NBC, that stars Howie Mandel and DJ Ravidrums.

Mandel appears, often incognito, in several of the jokes. After the big reveal, either Howie or one of his assistants then delivers the line "This is Howie Do It!"
