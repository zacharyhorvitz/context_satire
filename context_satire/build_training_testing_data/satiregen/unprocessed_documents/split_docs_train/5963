On October 20, 1998, Anita Hill published the book Speaking Truth to Power. Throughout much of the book she gives details on her side of the sexual harassment controversy, and her professional relationship with Clarence Thomas. Aside from that, she also provides a glimpse of what her personal life was like all the way from her childhood days growing up in Oklahoma to her position as a law professor.  While most of the focus for the next nine days will be on President Donald Trump as he makes his first international trip as commander in chief, there will be plenty of eyes on first lady Melania Trump, also set to bow on the global stage. "I am very excited for the upcoming trip," said the first lady in a prepared statement one day before her departure. "This will not just be an opportunity to support my husband as he works on important matters of national security and foreign relations, it will also be my honor to visit and speak with women and children from different countries, with different perspectives," she added. The trip, which includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel, Rome, Brussels and Sicily, will likely shine the biggest spotlight on Melania Trump to date. An Iranian delegation composed of Members of Parliament and their Secretary of a Development Committee was in Canada to formally meet with officials at the International Civil Aviation Organization in Montreal. The delegation requested a meeting with Jowhari which took place in his constituency office in Richmond Hill. Jowhari stated over email that the premise of this meeting was an opportunity to listen and discuss as well as express his concerns related to human rights in Iran. “This was an opportunity to listen — as I do with many diverse groups — and to express cautious optimism about the future, including commercial links and facilitating people-to-people ties,” Jowhari said in an email.
