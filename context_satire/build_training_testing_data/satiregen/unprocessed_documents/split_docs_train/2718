The association has recently added the suffix "of the United Kingdom" to its website tagline. Its founding aim was to raise the funds for an annual national rifle meeting (now known as the Imperial Meeting) "for the promotion of marksmanship in the interests of Defence of the Realm and permanence of the Volunteer Forces, Navy, Military and Air". 2009 marked the 150th Anniversary of the National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom. These days the association is primarily concerned with civilian full-bore target rifle shooting, although retaining its military heritage and close links with the British Armed Forces. In the 2010s, AR-15 style rifles have become one of the "most beloved and most vilified rifles" in the United States, according to the New York Times. The rifle has been promoted as "America's rifle" by the National Rifle Association. Steadily increasing popularity in part is due to "the amount of attention through politics and media that is devoted to banning or restricting AR pattern rifles". They have been used in mass shootings in the United States.
