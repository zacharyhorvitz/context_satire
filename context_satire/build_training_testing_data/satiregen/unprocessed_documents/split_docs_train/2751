 Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh claimed in an interview Monday night with Fox News' Martha MacCallum that he was a virgin through high school and for many years after. He also said he wants a fair process through which he can defend himself against allegations of sexual assault and other sexually inappropriate behavior that have been made against him. The former we could go without hearing; the latter goes without saying. But this is where we are.  The Senate took its first step toward formally considering Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination on the floor of the US Senate on Friday evening. In a voice vote, lawmakers passed the motion to proceed on Kavanaugh's confirmation, meaning there would be no Saturday session -- though the future of Kavanaugh's nomination now lies in the hands of an FBI investigation. The move comes after a week of uncertainty surrounding Kavanaugh's nomination as the nation watched both the judge and the woman who has accused him of sexual assault testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about the alleged incident. Christine Blasey Ford has accused Kavanaugh of committing sexual assault against her more than three decades ago when both were at a party in their high school years.  Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh said in written testimony for Thursday's hearing with a woman accusing him of sexual assault that he is facing a barrage of "last-minute smears." "There has been a frenzy to come up with something -- anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious -- that will block a vote on my nomination," Kavanaugh's testimony said. The Senate Judiciary Committee released the testimony Kavanaugh submitted a day ahead of his scheduled appearance before the hearing on an accusation brought by Christine Blasey Ford, who has said he sexually assaulted her at a party in their high school years. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation along with accusations from others who have gone public since Ford.
