In February 2014, Derek Muller used his YouTube account Veritasium to upload a video titled "Facebook Fraud". Within three days, the video had gone viral with more than a million views (it has reached 2,521,614 views as of June 10, 2014). In the video, Muller illustrates how after paying US$50 to Facebook advertising, the "likes" to his fan page have tripled in a few days and soon reached 70,000 "likes", compared to his original 2,115 likes before the advertising. Despite the significant increase in likes, Muller noticed his page has actually decreased in engagement â€“ there were fewer people commenting, sharing, and liking his posts and updates despite the significant increase in "likes". On December 27, 2012, CBS News reported that Randi Zuckerberg, sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, criticized a friend for being "way uncool" in sharing a private Facebook photo of her on Twitter, only to be told that the image had appeared on a friend-of-a-friend's Facebook news feed. Commenting on this misunderstanding of Facebook's privacy settings, Eva Galperin of the EFF said "Even Randi Zuckerberg can get it wrong. That's an illustration of how confusing they can be." But, apparently enough, Facebook users are annoyed with having the stories appear at the top of their news feed with no way to turn it off, as seen in Facebook's Help Community question "How to turn off 'your story' on the top of my news feed", that plugin extensions to Chrome and Firefox have been written specifically to hide Facebook stories. As of September 2019, Facebook itself has so far not created an off option for its users.
