PNC Financial Services traces its history to the Pittsburgh Trust and Savings Company which was founded in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on April 10, 1845. Due to the long recovery from the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, PNC was not fully operational until January 28, 1852. It originally opened offices at Liberty Avenue and 12th Street. The bank was renamed The Pittsburgh Trust Company in 1853. In 1946, First National merged with Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company, with whom it had worked closely since the 1930s, to form Peoples First National Bank & Trust. In 1959, Peoples First merged with Fidelity Trust Company to form Pittsburgh National Bank. At this time, the bank adopted the first version of its present logoâ€“a stylized triangle representing the Golden Triangle. In 1969, the bank reorganized as a holding company, Pittsburgh National Corporation. First Camden National Bank & Trust is located in Camden, Camden County, New Jersey, United States. The building was built in 1928 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 24, 1990. The bank that was headquartered here changed its name to South Jersey National Bank in the 1960s and to Heritage Bank in the 1970s. It later merged with Midlantic National Bank, which was ultimately acquired by PNC Bank.
