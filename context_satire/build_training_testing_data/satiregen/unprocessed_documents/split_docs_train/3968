 April 18, 2013 Media Literacy Question of the Day How should news organizations deal with rapidly changing information during times of breaking news? * * Daily Discussion Questions What do you know about Monday's terror bombing at the Boston Marathon? What could you do to ensure that you have the most recent information and that it is accurate? Why would this be important?  Police are searching for the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing this morning, identified by Boston police as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, age 19. The ongoing manhunt follows a violent night, during which Dzhokhar's older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a firefight with authorities in which the men allegedly hurled explosives at pursuers after killing a university police officer, robbing a convenience store and hijacking a car. According to a source briefed on the investigation, the suspects are originally from the Russian Caucasus and had moved to Kazakhstan at a young age before coming to the United States several years ago. Eric Machado went to high school with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the suspect who is still on the loose.  Evidence uncovered so far supports the theory that the two brothers suspected in the Boston Marathon bombings had no help, authorities said Saturday. "From what I know right now, these two acted together and alone," Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau told CNN. "I think we have to be ever vigilant, and we're learning as we go along, but as far as this little cell -- this little group -- I think we got our guys." Deveau said investigators were continuing to look into where Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26. and Dzhokar Tsarnaev, 19, may have gotten the resources to amass the cache of weapons used in the bombings and afterward.
