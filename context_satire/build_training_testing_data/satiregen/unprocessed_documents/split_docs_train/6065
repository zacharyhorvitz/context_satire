 Tamerlan Tsarnaev was brought to the attention of U.S. authorities in 2011 when the Russian government asked the FBI to check him out because of his alleged shift toward Islamic extremism. The bureau interviewed Tamerlan and his family as part of a review, but found no ties to terrorism. Now, members of Congress want to know how the alleged Boston bomber slipped under the radar of authorities. On Starting Point this morning, Ambassador R. James Woolsey, a former CIA director, tells John Berman that "this is a case of these government agencies not working together and not even communicating with each other."  The body of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev lies unclaimed in a state morgue. Authorities had not yet determined a cause of death on Wednesday, and no one had stepped forward to claim the body, said Terrel Harris, a spokesman for the Massachusetts state medical examiner. The suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, said she wanted her son to be buried near a Cambridge mosque and told CNN earlier in the week that family members had arranged for a funeral on Tuesday or Wednesday. But the Islamic Society of Boston said Wednesday that the family had not contacted local mosque officials with any funeral requests. By the time the Bojinka plot was discovered, Mohammed had returned to Qatar and his job as a project engineer at the country's Ministry of Electricity and Water. He traveled in 1995 to Sudan, Yemen, Malaysia, and Brazil to visit elements of the worldwide jihadist community, although no evidence connects him to specific terrorist actions in any of those locations. On his trip to Sudan, he attempted to meet with Osama Bin Laden, who was at the time living there, aided by Sudanese political leader Hassan al-Turabi. After the US asked the Qatari government to arrest Mohammed in January 1996, he fled to Afghanistan, where he renewed his alliance with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf.
