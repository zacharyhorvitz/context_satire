 Mitt Romney was ready.

The result seemed so imbalanced that even some of the president's supporters quickly conceded defeat. Complete coverage: Presidential debates 2012 "It looked like Romney wanted to be there and President Obama did not," said Democratic Party strategist and CNN Contributor James Carville.  Mitt Romney's solid debate performance Wednesday night gives him the type of energy and momentum that President Barack Obama now will have to work overtime to undo. "The thing that this debate did is it gave people reasons to think about (a) President Romney," said John Geer, chairman of Vanderbilt University's political science department. "This often happens with challengers in the first debate. Now Obama needs to reconnect with the American public and (make the case of) why he should be re-elected."  The split screen told the story -- when Mitt Romney was speaking, President Barack Obama was looking down; when Obama was speaking, Romney was looking at the president. "It has killed jobs," Romney said during Wednesday's debate about the politically charged health care law pushed by Obama. "Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said, will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance." Romney looked at the crowd, moderator Jim Lehrer and even Obama during the exchange.
