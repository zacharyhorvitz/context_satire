The L Word: Generation Q is an American drama television series produced by Showtime that premiered on December 8, 2019. It is a sequel series to The L Word, which aired on Showtime from 2004 to 2009. Generation Q is set over ten years after the events of The L Word, relocating the setting to Silver Lake, Los Angeles. Several actors from the original series return to reprise their roles alongside a new ensemble of diverse characters. Showtime has become known in recent years for the network's original television programs, the most popular of which include the crime drama Dexter, the dark comedy-drama Weeds, family dramas Ray Donovan and Shameless and the drama/thriller series Homeland. Other notable past and present original series include Stargate SG-1 (which ran on Showtime for its first five seasons, before moving to the Sci-Fi Channel (now Syfy) for the remainder of its run); Dead Like Me; Californication; Gigolos; Nurse Jackie; The Tudors; Brotherhood; Soul Food; Queer as Folk; The L Word; The Big C; Penn & Teller: Bullshit! ; and United States of Tara. In mid-2017, the channel aired critically acclaimed  third season of David Lynch's TV series Twin Peaks. In the first four seasons, Showtime's original competition format was that three groups, each made up of two to twenty-five members (with no age limit), perform a single performance, either a dance and/or song number. Before the performance, one group member is given twenty seconds to make an introduction before ending with the phrase "It's Showtime!". After the group's performance, the hurados and the studio audiences will rate the group from 1 to 10. The group with the highest average scores from the hurados wins the competition.
