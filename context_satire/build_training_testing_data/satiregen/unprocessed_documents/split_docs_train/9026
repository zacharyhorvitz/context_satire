At first, Sharon refused to resign, and Begin refused to fire him. It was only after the death of Emil Grunzweig after a grenade was tossed by a right-wing Israeli into the dispersing crowd of a Peace Now protest march, which also injured ten others, that a compromise was reached: Sharon would resign as Defense Minister, but remain in the Cabinet as a minister without portfolio. Notwithstanding the dissuading conclusions of the Kahan report, Sharon would later become Prime Minister of Israel. The Kahan Commission concluded Israeli Defense minister Ariel Sharon bears personal responsibility "for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge" and "not taking appropriate measures to prevent bloodshed". Sharon's negligence in protecting the civilian population of Beirut, which had come under Israeli control, amounted to a non-fulfillment of a duty with which the Defense Minister was charged, and it was recommended that Sharon be dismissed as Defense Minister. Other Israeli politicians who paid tribute to Sharon included Benjamin Netanyahu, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, Defence Minister Moshe Ya'alon, and former prime minister Ehud Olmert. Isaac Herzog, leader of the opposition Israeli Labor Party, said: "Ariel Sharon will be remembered as a great leader. For many years we were in opposing camps, but it's impossible not to appreciate a man who could change his worldview and recognize the correct path for the State of Israel."
