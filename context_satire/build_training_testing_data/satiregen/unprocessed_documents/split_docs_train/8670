 For years now, people like environmentalist and journalist Bill McKibben have been screaming from the treetops that we need a World War II-scale mobilization to fight the scourge of climate change. They're right, of course. And on Earth Day -- that 24-hour sliver of the calendar when we talk about the fact that humans exist on, and because of, a living planet -- it's clear not only that we are losing this war but that we still are failing to recognize it's taking place at all. I mean, yes, I've met Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen who is "schooling world leaders" on climate policy and who started a global school walkout movement. Sweden (Swedish: Sverige  (listen)), officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: Konungariket Sverige  (listen)), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and north and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Ã–resund Strait. At 450,295 square kilometres (173,860 sq mi), Sweden is the largest country in Northern Europe, the third-largest country in the European Union and the fifth largest country in Europe by area. The capital city is Stockholm.  Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg met Pope Francis after his weekly audience at the Vatican on Wednesday. The Swedish 16-year-old carried a sign reading "Join the Climate Strike," which she showed the Pope after he greeted her. A day earlier, Thunberg urged European Union leaders to "panic" about climate change, as she addressed a committee of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. She went on to condemn politicians for spending their time "arguing about taxes or Brexit" in the face of a building climate crisis.
