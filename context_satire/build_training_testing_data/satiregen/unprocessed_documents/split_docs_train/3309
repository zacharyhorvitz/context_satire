Bari were declared bankrupt at the end of the season, and in July 2018 it was being reported that Henderson had agreed to move to Verona. He signed a new one-year contract with Watford in June 2010, with the club having an option to extend it another year. On 14 September Henderson joined League One club Colchester United on loan until early January 2011. After making 11 appearances he returned to Watford after his loan was not renewed by Colchester. After a brief period back at Watford he was sent out on loan to League Two side Aldershot Town on an initial one-month deal on 6 January. On 13 March 2014, Henderson made his first start in a competitive game in an away league match at Kilmarnock. Celtic won 3–0 and Henderson was praised by manager Neil Lennon for his performance, saying "I thought he grew into the game and had a superb debut. Credit to him and credit to the academy, because I think we have got a good player there." Henderson scored his first goal for Celtic on 26 March 2014, the second goal in Celtic's 5–1 win away at Partick Thistle which clinched the league title.
