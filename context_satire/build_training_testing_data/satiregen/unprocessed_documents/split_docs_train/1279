 Now it begins. All over again. The primary season over and the nominating conventions complete, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama hit the ground running Friday for the final stretch of a campaign that began, for Romney at least, more than a year ago in Iowa. Over the next 60 days of campaigning, much of it focusing on key battleground states, the two men will pitch their visions for the country to a divided electorate. On July 4, 2007, the Romney campaign officially launched the "Mitt Mobile, A Five Brothers Bus", referring to Romney's five sons and his official campaign blog, Five Brothers. When asked why his sons were not fighting in Iraq, Romney replied that his sons were supporting America by riding from town to town in the "Five Brothers Bus," saying "One of the ways my sons are showing support for our nation is helping me get elected." Romney later apologized and said he misspoke and that there is no comparison to the sacrifice that military persons make. The RV, a Winnebago made in Iowa, had a large map of Iowa on the back and a Romney family portrait on the side with the label "Mitt Mobile", "A Five Brothers Bus".  On Tuesday, Democrats capped the first night of their convention with a speech from First Lady Michelle Obama which spoke to the Presidentâ€™s character and accomplishments over his term in office. Earlier, rising-star San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro delivered the keynote address, praising the current president and taking jabs and Mitt Romney on health care. Other Democrats like Fmr. Ohio Gov.
