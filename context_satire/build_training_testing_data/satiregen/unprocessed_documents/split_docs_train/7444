 The people of Jersey City voted overwhelmingly to uphold new restrictions on short-term rentals, in a move expected to cut down on the number of properties listed on Airbnb in New Jersey's second-largest city. Unofficial results from Tuesday's referendum showed that about 70% of voters supported restrictions on short-term rentals, with 97% of precincts reporting. Under the new restrictions, landlords who don't live on site would be prohibited from offering short-term rentals in buildings with more than four units. They would also be restricted to renting out their properties no more than 60 nights a year, among other measures.  A small plane crashed Sunday in LeRoy, New York, a city about 30 miles southwest of Rochester, officials said. All four people who were in the aircraft were taken to the hospital, the LeRoy Fire Department posted on Facebook. "All injuries are believed to be minor at this time," the Genessee Sheriff's Office said in a release. All four -- a couple and their two children -- were able to get out of the plane by themselves, the sheriff's office said.  President Donald Trump, a native New Yorker, has now declared himself a Florida resident, according to court documents. The President changed his permanent residence to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, in late September, and first lady Melania Trump followed suit in October, in forms filed with the Palm Beach County Circuit Court. In a series of tweets Thursday night, Trump said he was leaving New York because he's been "treated very badly" by politicians in the Empire State. "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House, is the place I have come to love and will stay for, hopefully, another 5 years as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, but my family and I will be making Palm Beach, Florida, our Permanent Residence," Trump tweeted.
