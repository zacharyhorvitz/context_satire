In the U.S., one of these pairs belonged to a woman who jumped from a bridge. Of the two other U.S. feet identified, one foot belonged to a missing fisherman and the other of a depressed man who probably committed suicide. His identity was withheld on request of his family. Another theory is that the feet belonged to people who died in the Asian tsunami on December 26, 2004. Richmond-based writer Shane Lambert said that many of the shoes found were manufactured and sold in 2004 or earlier, and that there could be other sources for the shoes or multiple sources. Besides the manufacturing dates of the shoes, Lambert has said that ocean currents and their northward-traveling tendencies could have carried the feet up the Pacific Ocean from the region that was hit by the 2004 tsunami. Bridegroom chronicles the story of Shane Bitney Crone and his partner Thomas Lee "Tom" Bridegroom, who died in 2011 following an accidental fall from the rooftop of a four-story apartment building in Los Angeles. After Bridegroom's death, Crone found himself cut off and deprived of any legal protection. The film tells the story of their 6-year-long relationship, and the struggles Crone faced after Bridegroom's death, including the family not allowing Crone to attend the funeral of his life partner.
