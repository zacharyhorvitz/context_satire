 Gun legislation that advocacy groups call the strongest and most comprehensive to be taken up across the nation moved closer to passage Wednesday evening as the Connecticut House debated a measure passed by the state's Senate. If the bill is approved by the House, as expected, Connecticut becomes the third state to pass such a tough measure following the December rampage in Newtown. Connecticut Against Gun Violence called the bill historic on its website and applauded lawmakers on its extensive reach. Many portions would take effect immediately, including the banning of the sale or purchase of large capacity magazines, once Gov.  Saying he hopes it sets an example for the nation, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy on Thursday signed what advocacy groups call the strongest and most comprehensive gun legislation in the nation. The new law bans some weapons as well as the sale or purchase of high-capacity magazines like those used in the Newtown shooting in December that left 20 children and six adults dead. It also requires background checks for all gun purchases.  President Obama heads to Colorado today to make his case for Congress to take action on gun control. He's going to meet with law enforcement and community leaders at the Denver Police Academy, not far from the site of the Aurora movie theater massacre. The president is pushing for universal background checks for gun buyers, and he's calling on Congress to at least vote on an assault weapons ban and limits on large-capacity magazines. Colorado just expanded background checks and placed restrictions on magazines.
