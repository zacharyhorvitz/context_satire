Lockwood graduated with honors in 1857 and soon became the headmistress of Lockport Union School. It was a responsible position, but Lockwood found that whether she was teaching or working as an administrator, she was paid half of what her male counterparts were making. (Later Lockwood worked for pay equity for women during her legal career.) It was during her studies at Genesee College that she first became attracted to the law, although the school had no law department. Born in Malvern, Arkansas, Fred Jones moved to Portland, Oregon in middle school and became the Oregon High School Player of the Year in both his Junior and Senior years for Sam Barlow High School in Gresham, a suburb of Portland. He then went on to play four seasons at the University of Oregon, where, during his senior year, he led the Ducks to the Elite Eight, with the help of PG Luke Ridnour and G/F Luke Jackson. While widely considered to be an underachiever during his first three years at Oregon, Jones jumped onto the national radar screen as a senior, becoming a candidate for Pac-10 Player of the Year and averaging 18.6 points per game. There is also a high school east of Gresham, Oregon, Sam Barlow High School, named after him.
