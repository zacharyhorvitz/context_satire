 With 36 days left to the election, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are finishing last minute preparations for the first presidential debate on Wednesday. Brad Woodhouse, communications director of the Democratic National Committee, argues that the upcoming presidential debates give candidates the opportunity to show their character. Woodhouse argues that, unlike Romney, the president will steer clear of one-liners and zingers in favor of offering a compelling narrative to the American people.  The Obama and Romney campaigns are seeking to manage -- and in some cases lower -- expectations for their candidate's performance in the first presidential debate. CNN obtained a memo on Thursday circulated by Beth Myers, an adviser to Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, that outlines several reasons why President Barack Obama may win the first of three scheduled encounters next Wednesday in Denver. Obama, Myers wrote, "is a universally acclaimed public speaker and has substantial debate experience under his belt," referencing the Democrat's 2008 campaign against John McCain. Myers also warned that Obama would likely go after Romney.  With less than six weeks until the 2012 election, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will face off in the first presidential debate Wednesday. Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX) argues that the debate will be a “game changer” for Romney, offering the former governor the chance to better communicate his message to the American public. “The expectations are most Americans believe President Obama's going to win the debates,” Poe says. “That's why it's a great opportunity for Governor Romney to have an upset.
