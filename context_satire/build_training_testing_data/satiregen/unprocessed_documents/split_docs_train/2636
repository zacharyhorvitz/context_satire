In 1968, Nolan was cast in the episode "All in a Day's Work" on the NBC police drama Ironside, playing a mother who has lost her only child who was shot after a robbery. That same year she appeared on Hawaii Five-O in the role of Aunt Martha. Camp played the role of Perfect in columbinus in 2005. In 2007, she was nominated for a Lucille Lortel Award for her performance in the Off-Broadway play The Scene. She played Jill Mason in the 2008 Broadway revival of Equus at the Broadhurst Theatre, which starred Daniel Radcliffe as Alan Strang. Speaking about the role, Camp said, "I had a lot of thought; I didn't even know if I was going to do Equus because of the nudity and because of the high profile  of it. In 1977 they appeared in the 23rd Disney animated film The Rescuers, in which McIntire voiced the cat Rufus and Nolan the muskrat Ellie Mae. Four years later, the couple worked on the 24th Disney film, The Fox and the Hound, with McIntire as the voice of Mr. Digger, an ill-tempered badger, and Nolan as the original voice of Widow Tweed, the old kindly widow who takes in Tod after his mother was killed by an off-screen hunter.
