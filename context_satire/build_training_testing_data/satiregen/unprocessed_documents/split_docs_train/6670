 President Barack Obama said Monday he ordered the "full resources" of the federal government to respond to the Boston bombings on Monday, including increased security around the United States as necessary. Pledging a full investigation to find out what happened, Obama said any individuals or groups responsible for what he called the "senseless" loss will "feel the full weight of justice." The president spoke to reporters at the White House a few hours after explosions rocked an area near the finish line of Monday's Boston Marathon. "I've directed the full resources of the federal government to help state and local authorities protect our people, increase security around the United States, as necessary, and investigate what happened," Obama said.  President Obama says those responsible for bombing the Boston Marathon will not escape justice. The president spoke speaking Monday night at the White House where he promised to find out who was responsible for the attack and why. He also reached out to leaders in congress saying this is a time for unity among all Americans. This morning Homeland Security Committee member Rep. Peter King (R-NY) weighs in on the investigation.
