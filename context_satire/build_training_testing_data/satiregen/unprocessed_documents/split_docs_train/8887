On April 2, 2015, nearly 5 years following the accidental shooting of Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Weekley has been reestablished to active duty as a Detroit police officer. The department decided to withdraw the police officer from active duty shortly after the incident that took place on May 16, 2010. Weekley was transferred from Special Response Team to the Criminal Investigations Bureau. Police Chief James Craig states, "He'll be in a limited duty capacity. Craig was raised in Detroit and graduated from Cass Tech High School. He first joined the Detroit Police force in 1977 until 1981. He was laid off that year and went to Los Angeles to work for the LAPD. From 2009 to 2011 he was police chief in Portland, Maine. In June 2019, after Noonan called on congressional Democrats to censure President Trump in the wake of the Mueller Report, he attacked her on Twitter, calling her "simplistic" and claiming that she "is stuck in the past glory of Reagan."
