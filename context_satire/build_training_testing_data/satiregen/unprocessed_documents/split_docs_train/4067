In an August 2019 interview with The Washington Post, Donald Trump opened up about his relationship with his late brother and expressed regret over how he treated Fred Jr. and his struggle with alcoholism. Trump said Freddy's memory still shapes his life to this day, and had a huge impact on the trajectory of his own business career and life. In the interview Donald Trump said, "He was so handsome, and I saw what alcohol did to him even physically ... and that had an impact on me, too."  The European adventures of President Donald Trump's adult sons are now complete. Meeting the Queen: check. Pulling pints of Guinness in the Irish countryside: check. Donald Jr. and Eric enjoyed the welcome of long-lost friends in the little Irish village of Doonbeg, County Clare, which is home to the Trump International golf resort and hotel. "I think this got made because Eric was in the right mood. He's an incredibly private man and despite his immense success, he's never cared if he got any publicity at all, he just loves his music ... I think it might be something to do with his age, as he turned 70 a couple of years ago. He said to me, "I didn't want it to be done after I was dead and for it to be wrong."
