Though socially libertarian, Harper has expressed some socially conservative views on certain issues. In 1994, he opposed plans by federal Justice Minister Allan Rock to introduce spousal benefits for same-sex couples. Citing the recent failure of a similar initiative in Ontario, he was quoted as saying, "What I hope they learn is not to get into it. There are more important social and economic issues, not to mention the unity question." In 1997, Harper delivered a controversial speech on Canadian identity to the Council for National Policy, a conservative American think tank. He made comments such as "Canada is a Northern European welfare state in the worst sense of the term, and very proud of it", "if you're like all Americans, you know almost nothing except for your own country. Which makes you probably knowledgeable about one more country than most Canadians", and "the NDP  is kind of proof that the Devil lives and interferes in the affairs of men." These statements were made public and criticized during the 2006 election. In February 2012, Bill C-30 was presented to Parliament by Harper's government. The legislation, entitled the Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act despite not having any provisions related to child sexual abuse online or otherwise, was designed to aid law enforcement's ability to track online activity. It provided provisions for the government to gather information online about citizens without a warrant, and without their ability to be aware they were under suspicion. Controversy over the warrantless privacy invasion and the poor behaviour of the minister introducing the legislation led to a public backlash over privacy concerns.
