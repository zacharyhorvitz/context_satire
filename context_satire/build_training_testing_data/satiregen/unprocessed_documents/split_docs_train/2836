 Wall Street's response to Apple's annual product release on Wednesday was, as one analyst described it, a yawn. The company unveiled a handful of new devices and modest updates, including three new versions of the iPhone X and an Apple Watch with new features. All of that was expected. There was little fanfare. Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth ... Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power, once reserved for big corporations, to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets. The company's growth from two guys to a billion-dollar corporation exemplifies the American Dream. Even as a large corporation, Apple plays David to IBM's Goliath, and thus has the sympathetic role in that myth.  Apple's former CEO says it's no longer a tech innovator, it's a luxury brand. And that's a smart move, according to John Sculley, who led Apple from the mid 1980s to early 1990s. Sculley told CNN's Julia Chatterley on "First Move" Wednesday that Apple has embarked on a "carefully crafted strategy" to sell higher-priced phones that are more profitable. He said Apple has only about 15% market share of the industry, but 90% of the profits.
