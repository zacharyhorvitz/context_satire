 In five back-to-back town halls hosted by CNN in New Hampshire on Monday, Democratic presidential contenders broke with each other on whether President Donald Trump should be impeached. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren forcefully argued that Trump's actions uncovered by special counsel Robert Mueller merit impeachment. California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg both also said they support impeachment proceedings. But Sen. Amy Klobuchar took a much more cautious approach, saying she would wait to see what happens in the House, where impeachment proceedings originate.  Forget "Minnesota nice." In her CNN town hall on Monday night, Sen. Amy Klobuchar came across as "Minnesota smart." Taking questions from young people in New Hampshire, Klobuchar presented a command of the issues, a rapport with her audience, and a healthy sense of humor. In a different year, there would be no question that Klobuchar deserves to be taken seriously as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.  Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar urged a more cautious approach than many of her Democratic rivals on impeachment, health care, college tuition, and student loans on Monday night in New Hampshire. Klobuchar was the first of five of the party's 2020 presidential contenders to participate in back-to-back town halls hosted by CNN. Here are four takeaways from her appearance:   Riding the caution lane Perhaps more than any other Democratic candidate, Klobuchar has staked out the moderate lane in this crowded race for the party's nomination in 2020. That was immediately evident in her CNN town hall Monday night when she essentially declined to answer questions about whether the Mueller report offered grounds to impeach President Donald Trump.
