Colorado State University is a public land-grant institution and Carnegie Doctoral/Research University Extensive. The Board of Governors presides over the Colorado State University System, including the flagship campus in Fort Collins together with Colorado State University–Pueblo and the CSU–Global Campus. The Board consists of nine voting members appointed by the Governor of Colorado and confirmed by the Colorado State Senate, and four elected non-voting members. Voting members are community leaders from many fields, including agriculture, business, and public service. During the 2010-2011 school year, Colorado Mesa University distributed over $48 million in financial aid to 75% of the student body population through scholarships, grants, loans and student employment. In addition to funding from the college, the Mesa State Foundation awarded more than $300,000 in private scholarships to over 300 students. The University of Colorado Denver is the largest research institution in Colorado, attracting more than $375 million in research grants annually and granting more graduate degrees than any other institution in the state. The university has two campuses—one in downtown Denver at the Auraria Campus, and the other at the Anschutz Medical Campus located nearly 10 miles away in neighboring Aurora. Additionally, the Anschutz Medical Campus shares its campus with the Children's Hospital and University of Colorado Hospital. The dual campus nature of the university is the result of the 2004 consolidation of the University of Colorado Denver and the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.
