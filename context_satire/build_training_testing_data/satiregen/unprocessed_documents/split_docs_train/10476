 Sen. Cory Booker announced Monday that he will end his campaign after failing to qualify for the Democratic debate planned for Tuesday in Iowa. "It was a difficult decision to make, but I got in this race to win, and I've always said I wouldn't continue if there was no longer a path to victory," Booker said in an email to supporters Monday. The New Jersey Democrat's announcement came a day before six presidential candidates will participate in the CNN/Des Moines Register's debate in Des Moines, Iowa. He did not qualify for the event.  Less than four weeks from the Iowa caucuses, former Vice President Joe Biden in many ways appears to be in a stronger position now than he was when he entered the 2020 presidential race. Biden has defied perceptions that he is a weak front-runner, retaining his strength with non-white voters and ranking consistently as the candidate likely voters believe has the best chance to defeat President Donald Trump. Predictions that his age, penchant for gaffes and lengthy record would be his undoing have not come true. Now, a confluence of events in the lead-up to the first primary votes being cast are playing to Biden's strengths.  Cory Booker's theory of the 2020 case was a good one. It went something like this: Donald Trump's presidency has deeply divided us against ourselves. What Democrats (and the country) will want -- and need -- is someone who puts optimism, unity and, yes, love forward as the antidote to the current President. It made sense!
