Mia, a young woman in a small American Midwestern town, goes to a traveling carnival one evening, where she is urged by a silent clown to visit the carnival's circus and see the Aerialist, the show's star attraction. She is entranced by the Aerialist, but during his act he misses a catch and falls to the ground. She rushes to help him, but then the ground beneath them gives way and they fall into the dreamlike world of Cirque du Soleil. Separated, they travel through the different tent worlds trying to find each other, interacting with the strange and wonderful performers and performances of Cirque du Soleil. Given the recent near collapse of the global economy, The Debaters have decided to ask the question, is it time to take another look at Karl Marx?

Should governments be allowed to keep them? Stand up comic Dylan Rhymer says "no way Jose," whereas comic David Pryde thinks we just canâ€™t handle the truth. Then: should common law partners just put a ring on it?
