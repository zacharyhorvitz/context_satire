The ongoing spat with Home Depot finally came to a head in July 1995, when Rickel was sued by Home Depot in a New Jersey state court. At the time of the dispute, Home Depot was looking to build a large store on a plot of land situated on Orange Street in Bloomfield, New Jersey near the Watsessing train station and Exit 148 of the Garden State Parkway. Rickel once again cried foul, and this time it was due to what they perceived to be a large encroachment on their territory. So, in 1953 Al, Mort, and Bob opened up the first Rickel Brothers store in Union, New Jersey, and Ryan was warmly referred to as "employee number one" for his entire 35-year stint with the Rickel store chain. Rickel was one of the first "do-it-yourself" home improvement stores, expanding beyond plumbing supplies and selling heating and electrical supplies and tools in addition. An early slogan and jingle of the Rickel chain, which lasted in some degree to its 1997 closure, was "Rickel Helps You Do it Better- Do it Better With Rickel"- a reflection of the Rickel brothers' focus which included employees who could explain to customers how to perform their own home repairs. At the time, this was a new concept and it enabled 'Rickels' (as the store came to be known locally) to develop a loyal customer base. Long-time employee Marc Powers became the head of Home Depot's US stores division in 2014. He took the place of Marvin Ellison, who left to become the chief executive of J.C. Penney. In January, 2016 Home Depot announced the departure of Powers as division head, to be replaced by another veteran employee, Ann-Marie Campbell, one of Powers' deputies. The change in leadership is effective as of February 1, 2016.
