Any seasonal cloud cover at the new site needed to arrive in the opposite season to that at Climax, in order to then provide for year-round coverage of the Sun. Similar to Climax, the atmosphere above the new site should be exceptionally free from haze and dust in order to permit for the best possible observing. Roberts and Menzel examined the White Sands Proving Ground (an area used as a research rocket firing range near Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo, New Mexico). They "concluded that the section of the Sacramento Mountains in which Sacramento Peak is located would be especially promising for a solar research site. The National Solar Observatory (NSO) is a United States public research institute to advance the knowledge of the physics of the Sun. NSO studies the Sun both as an astronomical object and as the dominant external influence on Earth. NSO is headquartered in Boulder and operated facilities at two locations, at Sacramento Peak near Sunspot in New Mexico, and at Kitt Peak in Arizona until the end of fiscal year 2017. The institute constructed the 4-meter Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope in the Haleakala Observatory on the island of Maui. NOAO is a founding partner in the LSST project. The LSST is an 8m class telescope which will change the way some astronomers do science. More like a large physics program, LSST will run its own experiment and provide data to the LSST community in the form of images and astronomical catalogs. LSST will have a dedicated wide field imager, and the telescope will cover the entire sky visible from the southern hemisphere approximately every week.
