The escutcheon’s upper half with the tailor’s shears and narrow stripes (“bars”) is a reference to the tailor's craft and the clothing factories that were so important to the community's development in the 19th and 20th centuries. The shield's lower half shows the Wheel of Mainz in its historical tinctures, and this stands for the community's history as an Electoral Mainz holding until 1803. The arms have been borne since 1979. Asmus Jacob Carstens (or "Jakob", May 10, 1754 – May 25, 1798) was a Danish-German painter, one of the most committed artists of German Neoclassicism. His career was erratic, partly because of his difficult personality, and the majority of his large projects were left incomplete, or subsequently destroyed. Much of what survives is in the form of drawings, many using "a schematic, pale colouring as a timid and humble accessory to the dominating figure-drawing", that were planned for large fresco commissions that never materialized. Between Witzenhausen and Filton, and between Witzenhausen and St. Vallier, there are regular student exchanges with the local comprehensive school. The partnership between Witzenhausen and St. Vallier came about by accident. St. Vallier's mayor's last name at the time was Witzenhausen, and when, on a visit to Germany, he spotted this name on a road sign, he drove to the town. Out of his visit sprang the partnership, which has lasted to this day.
