Packer Memorial Church is an Episcopal church on campus. On Sundays, Roman-Catholic mass is usually held at 9:00 pm in the chapel. It is also available for weddings in which at least one of the parties is a Lehigh University student or alumnus. It used to be the location of the freshman convocation which is held during orientation at the beginning of each school year, however due to the growing class size, in 2007 convocation was moved to the larger Baker Auditorium in the Zoellner Arts Center. The Saucon Valley Playing Fields were renamed after Murray H. Goodman, alumnus and key contributor to the university during the difficult days of the 1980s, when Bethlehem Steel suffered decline. The land, embracing six hundred acres, was obtained during the complex expansion days for Steel, being the early post War period (1950s - 1960s). During the latter Lehigh agreed to purchase the property for roughly one thousand dollars per acre. The Campus sits on the relatively flat lands of Saucon Valley, which is south of South Mountain and across Interstate 78 from the other two campuses. In 1864, before plans for the University were drawn up, Asa Packer himself had sold a lot on what would soon become Lehigh's campus, to a group of Moravians. They quite promptly erected a stone church, and services were commenced before the year was out. However, the young group soon received notification of Mr. Packer's plans to found a great University on the land all around the young Church. After no doubt some difficult negotiations, the Moravians did agree to move, provided another suitable plot of land was granted them.
