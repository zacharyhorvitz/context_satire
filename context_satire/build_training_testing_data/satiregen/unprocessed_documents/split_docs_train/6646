 The worst of a brutal winter storm may be over for many, but plenty of residents of the Great Plains and Kansas City still were coping Tuesday with its effects. Ice and falling branches downed power lines, cutting electricity to tens of thousands of people. And the heavy, wet snow made getting around difficult,  whether by car or by foot. A CNN crew driving through Kansas City saw very few other drivers, and those who were out were taking their time.  It was a winter weather tale as old as, well, modern time: car vs. the snow plow. "There's our friend and our nemesis, the plow. Ugh," said David Bradley, whose car was buried Wednesday by a plow clearing streets in Toronto. Forty-five minutes later, he was still trying to dig out his car from a fierce snowstorm that paralyzed parts of the United States and Canada, leaving hundreds of thousands without power and stranding thousands more. Kansas City, abbreviated as "KCK", is the third-largest city in the State of Kansas, the county seat of Wyandotte County, and the third-largest city of the Kansas City metropolitan area. It is situated at Kaw Point, which is the junction of the Missouri and Kansas rivers. It borders Johnson County, Kansas to the south and Kansas City, Missouri (KCMO) to the east, after which Kansas City, Kansas, is named. It is part of a consolidated city-county government known as the "Unified Government".
