From 1900, Holy Family existed as a mission church of St. Helen's, Brockton, with the pastor there, Fr. Walsh, travelling to Parkdale on Sundays to celebrate mass. Holy Family Roman Catholic Church was created out of St Helen's, Archbishop O'Connor laying the cornerstone for the new church on June 22, 1902; school was constructed behind the church at the same time. When the church was built, plans were already underway for new parishes to be carved out of Holy Family; St. Leo's (Mimico) existed as a 'mission' church of Holy Family until separating in 1909 taking the independent village of Swansea. Eventually, the increasing numbers of worshippers again outgrew the church. Thus, it was again demolished on 29 December 1997 to make way for the current, larger, 4-storey church building. During this time, Sunday Masses were celebrated in the main hall of Saint Patrick's School while the Weekday masses are held in the school chapel. The new church was completed and consecrated in December 1999, just prior to the start of the second millennium. The Holy Family consists of the Child Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and Saint Joseph. Veneration of the Holy Family was formally begun in the 17th century by Saint Fran√ßois de Laval, the first bishop of New France, who founded a Confraternity. The Feast of the Holy Family is a liturgical celebration in the Catholic Church and some Anglican Churches in honor of Jesus, his mother, and his legal father, Saint Joseph, as a family. The primary purpose of this feast is to present the Holy Family as a model for Christian families.The Feast is held on the Sunday between Christmas and New Year's Day; If both are Sundays, the feast is celebrated on December 30th.
