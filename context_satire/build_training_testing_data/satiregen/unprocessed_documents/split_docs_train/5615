In January 2008, the Associated Press reported that Bloomberg met with Clay Mulford, a ballot-access expert and campaign manager for Ross Perot's third-party presidential campaigns. Bloomberg denied that the meeting concerned a possible presidential campaign, and said the following month, "I am not – and will not be – a candidate for president." He added that he is "hopeful that the current campaigns can rise to the challenge by offering truly independent leadership. The most productive role that I can serve is to push them forward, by using the means at my disposal to promote a real and honest debate." In October 2010, the Committee to Draft Michael Bloomberg – which had attempted to recruit Bloomberg to run for the presidency in 2008 – announced it was relaunching its effort to persuade Bloomberg to wage a presidential campaign, in 2012. The committee members insisted that they would persist in the effort in spite of Bloomberg's repeated denials of interest in seeking the presidency.  Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg would vote to convict President Donald Trump if he were a senator in the impeachment trial, he said in an interview that aired Monday. "We'd be much better off letting the voters decide who is President in this country," the Democratic presidential candidate said in an interview on NBC's "Today Show." "I'd have to swallow two or three times, but I would say I would vote to convict because there's so much evidence that he acted inappropriately." Bloomberg has previously said that the 2020 election is a "better forum" to remove President Donald Trump from office than a formal impeachment inquiry.
