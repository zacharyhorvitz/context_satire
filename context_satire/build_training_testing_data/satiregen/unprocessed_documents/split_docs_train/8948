In a bar in town Ben and Alison meet with Sammyâ€™s partner, an English ex-army man Captain Stopes. Also in the bar are Ortega and his men. Ben and Alison believe the entire tale of the diamond mine is a swindle. However, when Stopes is murdered in his hotel room, with Ben and Alison and Sammy suspected and pursued by the police, Ben is compelled to finance the diamond mine expedition as a way for he and Alison to sneak out of town. Almost immediately after they resume their search the men start fighting with each other. That night McCune demands that the men allow him to bed Alison. Sammy says nothing, but Ben will not allow it and he and McCune fight. Ben and Alison have a private conversation in which they admit to having fallen in love with each other. McCune died on April 11, 1976, in Vallejo, California. He bequeathed all of his rare books, printing presses, and bookbinding tools to the City of Vallejo. His full collection of art and rare books is now housed in the "McCune Room" of the city's John F. Kennedy Library.
