 Republicans are freaking out about Donald Trump, but the candidate himself is insisting his campaign has never been in better shape. Trump took the stage in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Wednesday with his presidential bid apparently floundering. Republican leaders and even senior members of his own team expressed frustration with his political meltdown on Tuesday. The GOP nominee tried to stem the growing panic -- addressing the state of his campaign right at the top of his speech.  Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger said Wednesday that he doesn't see how he can endorse his party's nominee, Donald Trump, in the wake of the week's events. "I'm an American before I'm a Republican," he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room." "I'm saying for me personally, how can I support that? Because he's crossed so many red lines that a commander in chief or a candidate for commander in chief should never cross."  If I close my eyes, I can bring into focus the blurry memories I have of crossing paths with Humayun Khan as young college students around the grounds of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville in the late 1990s. I see him standing outside the ROTC building in his army camouflage, and it occurs to me that even then he was already a soldier. You would think Donald Trump listening to Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the American Muslim parents of slain Capt. Humayun Khan, killed by a suicide bomb in Iraq more than a decade ago, would be enough for the Republican presidential nominee to denounce his own proposed ban on Muslims coming to America.
