In 1832, Prudence Crandall, a schoolteacher raised as a Quaker, stirred controversy when she opened the Canterbury Female Boarding School and admitted black girls to it. Prominent Canterbury resident Andrew T. Judson led efforts against the school. The Connecticut General Assembly passed a "Black Law" which prohibited the education of black children from out of state, but Crandall persisted in teaching, and in 1833 was arrested and spent a night in jail. Drawn- outlegal proceedings not leading to success, violence by a mob of Canterbury residents forced the closure of the school in 1834. Prudence Crandall (September 3, 1803 – January 27, 1890) was an American schoolteacher and activist. Crandall is remembered, and is the state heroine of Connecticut, for setting up the first school for black girls ("young Ladies and little Misses of color") in the country. This resulted in her arrest; then violence from townspeople forced her to close the school, and she left Connecticut.When Crandall admitted Sarah Harris, a 20-year-old African-American female student in 1832 to her school, she had what is considered to be the first integrated classroom in the United States. Parents of the white children began to withdraw them. Although Prudence Crandall grew up as a North American Quaker, she admitted that she was not acquainted with many people of color or abolitionists. She discovered the problems that plagued people of color through the abolitionist newspaper The Liberator, which she learned of through her housekeeper, "a young black lady", whose fiancé was the son of the paper's local agent. After reading The Liberator, Prudence Crandall said in an earlier account that she  "contemplated for a while, the manner in which I might best serve the people of color."
