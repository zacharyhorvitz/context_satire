 Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is willing to lend a hand to Donald Trump, he said Tuesday. Asked by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt whether he'd be willing to campaign for Trump or help with his debate prep, the former Trump nemesis was on board. He formally endorsed the Republican nominee in a Facebook post last Friday. "I am happy to help.  Monday's debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump has become a laughing matter for the Democratic nominee. At events across the country since Monday, Clinton has taken to mocking Trump's debate performance, causing her supporters to laugh at the Republican nominee. In Des Moines on Thursday, Clinton simply smiled and said, "Any of you see that debate on Monday night?" The audience at the outdoor rally in Iowa broke out into laughter.  In Hillary Clinton's eyes, Donald Trump knows he lost Monday night. Clinton, speaking with reporters on her plane, threw serious shade at Trump hours after the two met for the first presidential debate at Hofstra Univeristy. The former secretary of state gloated that she had a great night and said Trump, who complained about his microphone after the debate, knew he lost. As she walked away from reporters, Clinton was asked about Trump's complaints.
