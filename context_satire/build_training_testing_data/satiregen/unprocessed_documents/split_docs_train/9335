 Mitt Romney and Barack Obama courted veterans on Thursday in the battleground state of Virginia, appearing in communities that illustrate the state's heavy military presence and its reliance on defense spending for jobs. For the second-straight day, the pair campaigned in the same battleground state. Obama stopped near Virginia Beach while Romney spoke at a rally in Springfield, just down the road from the Pentagon. The two were in Ohio on Wednesday.  A Chinese-owned company that has been blocked from building wind farms near a US navy test site in Oregon plans to sue President Barack Obama, arguing that his order to stop the project was unconstitutional. Ralls, a company owned by two Chinese executives, believes the president violated constitutional protections on property ownership and legal process. The company is seeking to have the order overturned, or be paid compensation for its losses. A person familiar with the case said: "The president is not above the law, even if national security is involved."  Foreign policy drove the presidential campaign on Monday with Mitt Romney jabbing Barack Obama on overseas tensions ahead of the president's speech to the United Nations. The Republican White House challenger used a campaign stop in the battleground state of Colorado to question Obama's handling of international affairs, considered a strength for the incumbent heading into the November election. Romney keyed his attack around an interview aired on Sunday during which Obama said recent unrest in Libya would not prevent the country from developing a functioning government that adequately represents its people. "I think it was absolutely the right thing for us to do to align ourselves with democracy, universal rights, a notion that people have to be able to participate in their own governance," Obama told CBS' "60 Minutes."
