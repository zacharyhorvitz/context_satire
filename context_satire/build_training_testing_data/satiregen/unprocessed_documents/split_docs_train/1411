On August 5, 2015, Sterling's attorney Bobby Samini confirmed to KABC-TV that Sterling filed for divorce from his wife Shelly. In March 2016, Samini informed the Los Angeles Times that "notwithstanding all the difficult events of the last two years, the Sterlings have resolved their differences" and decided not to proceed with their divorce. All of the main characters on the program were modeled after a select group of local residents of Atlanta. The producers then had them dressed in period clothing. "We just grabbed people around here, and then it was just sort of a fluke that they ended up looking like, to some extent, their real-life counterparts." Archer was designed after an electrician who, according to Adam Reed, was "exactly that handsome and also really nice". Mamie Till coauthored with Christopher Benson her memoir Death of Innocence: The Story of the Hate Crime that Changed America, published by Random House in 2003, almost 50 years after the death of her son. Mamie Till's inspiration to write Death of Innocence came from the love for her son Emmett Till, the importance to herself to keep his story alive so that it could never happen again, and to bring to light just how racist white southerners were during those crucial times during the civil rights movement. She died just a few months before the final publication and release of her book.
