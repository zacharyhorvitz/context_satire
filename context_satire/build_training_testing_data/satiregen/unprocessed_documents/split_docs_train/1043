Sunday in the Park with George and Next to Normal are the only musicals that won the Pulitzer Prize and did not win the Tony Award for Best Musical, the latter won the Tony Award for Best Original Score and the Tony Award for Best Orchestrations. (Of Thee I Sing opened when the Tony Awards did not exist at that time) In 2004, responding to criticism, Sig Gissler, the administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes at the Columbia University School of Journalism, announced that they wanted to "broaden the prize a bit so that we can be more assured that we are getting the full range of the best of America's music..."  Jay T. Harris, a member of the Pulitzer governing board said: "The prize should not be reserved essentially for music that comes out of the European classical tradition." The drama jury, which consists of one academic and four critics, attends plays in New York and in regional theaters. The Pulitzer board has the authority to overrule the jury's choice, however, as happened in 1986 when the jury chose the CIVIL warS to receive the prize, but due to the board's opposition no award was given.
