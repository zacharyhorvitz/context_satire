 Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski announced her support for the Iran nuclear deal Wednesday, becoming the 34th senator to do so and giving the White House the support it needs to sustain a veto in order to overrule congressional Republicans opposed to the deal. Having a deciding voice on a major piece of legislation is just the cherry on top of Mikulski's lengthy career. She announced in March that she will retire in 2016, but she will leave Capitol Hill having left her mark. Mikulski was the first Democratic woman to serve in both houses of Congress, the first woman to win a state-wide election in Maryland and the first woman to serve as the head of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The neighborhood that is now called Capitol Hill started to develop when the government began work at two locations, the Capitol and the Washington Navy Yard. It became a distinct community between 1799 and 1810 as the federal government became a major employer. The first stage in its early history was that of a boarding house community developed for members of Congress. In the early years of the Republic, few Congressmen wished to establish permanent residence in the city. The library's primary mission is to research inquiries made by members of Congress, carried out through the Congressional Research Service. The library is open to the public, although only high-ranking government officials and library employees may check out books and materials.
