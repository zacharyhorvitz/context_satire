The department is "a presence in the burgeoning field of cognitive psychology." The research of the cognitive psychology program's faculty spans a wide set of issues within the study of cognitive processes that include cognitive control, memory, judgment and decision making, language processing, reasoning, and visual perception. The highly interdisciplinary quality of these topics of study results in research that is interactive and multifaceted. Most of the research is conducted at the intersection of fields like computer science and neuroscience. In October 2017, Carnegie Mellon took part in a study conducted by the University of Pittsburgh's Office of Child Development that examined food insecurity among students. The results from the CMU survey demonstrated that 19% of student respondents felt some sense of food insecurity, which is defined by the study as "a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life." In an effort to address the need for food security, CMU opened the doors to an on-campus pantry on November 9, 2018. Carnegie Mellon, along with the other institutions of Education City, has also been the subject of questions over how a U.S. institution that values freedom of speech can function in a country where Islamic Sharia Law is strictly enforced and the monarchy has absolute power. Critics have repeatedly called into question the role that Sharia Law plays on university campuses in Qatar and how this affects the students at Carnegie Mellon and others. Qatar also adheres to Wahhabism, one of the most fundamental sects of Islam. With these limitations in place due to Qatari societal norms, the question is raised of whether or not Carnegie Mellon and the rest of Education City can truly provide the same caliber of academic experiences as their main U.S. campuses.
