In 2003, he guest starred in The West Wing episode "The Long Goodbye". He portrayed the character Marco, who went to high school with C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney) and who helped her deal with her father's steady mental decline due to Alzheimer's disease. Modine agreed to take the role because he is a longtime friend of Janney's. Following defeat in the previous year's race, Oxford's first in eleven years, American Chris Clark was determined to gain revenge: "Next year we're gonna kick ass ... Cambridge's ass. Even if I have to go home and bring the whole US squad with me." He recruited another four American post-graduates: three international-class rowers (Dan Lyons, Chris Huntington and Chris Penny) and a cox (Jonathan Fish), in an attempt to put together the fastest Boat Race crew in the history of the contest. It was announced following this defeat of Larry Smith that O'Sullivan would take on former world contender Milton Nunez. O'Sullivan, before the fight, described the bout as "the most important fight of my life". He started the fight well with some solid body shots easily claiming the first round. He knocked Nunez down in the second round and ultimately scored an impressive victory, by TKO, over Nunez in the third round.
