It was initially reported that Luna did not have the expected substantial defense wounds on his hands and that many of the wounds are shallow which are called "hesitation" wounds in a suicide victim. Some suggested motives for suicide were that Luna was to take a polygraph test concerning $36,000 which disappeared from a bank robbery case that he had prosecuted. Luna had a charge card which his wife, Angela, did not know about. His name was on an Internet dating site and he had a $25,000 credit card debt. Wallace's mind set starts to change when his car is vandalised and some Ball workers come to his aid, workers who then start to include him in their off-hours activities. Mr. Ball announces the work force redundancies and Wallace is clearly uncomfortable seeing them, knowing that it was his recommendation that sealed their fate. Emily, also known as Grace, is portrayed by Katja Herbers and as a child by Adison LaPenna. She is William's daughter, and is formally introduced in the second season, seen as an adult guest at a Delos park themed on the British Raj, one of the six (or more) parks on the Delos-controlled island. When the hosts in the Raj start to exhibit the same revolt as the Westworld ones, Emily escapes into Westworld and finds William, traveling as the Man in Black, during his mission. She resents her father for past actions that contributed to her mother's suicide.
