 This is apparently where we are as a nation: some conservatives are hailing Kanye West and slamming Taylor Swift. Both artists have been catching heat for their political stances, with one seeming to gain new supporters from unexpected places and the other turning off some core fans. That description could actually go for both of them, depending upon who you ask. Remember the simpler times, when being #TeamTay or #TeamYe was more about taste in music?  As recently as May, rapper T.I. was still firmly on Team Kanye, but that ended Thursday with the latter's much-publicized trip to the White House. In a lengthy post on Instagram, T.I. said he's been "extremely patient and made it a point to not jump to any premature conclusions about" West and "his antics," but said West's meeting with the president was something of a last straw.  Rapper Kanye West met Thursday with Donald Trump, telling the President in an Oval Office meeting before reporters why he supports the Republican. "There was something about putting this hat on that made me feel like Superman," West said, as part of an extended soliloquy that spanned topics from his mental health to prison reform to what kind of plane Trump should fly in. West also said the President is on a "hero's journey." "Let's stop worrying about the future, all we have is today," West said, commenting on his own presidential ambitions.
