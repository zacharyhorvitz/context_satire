 A journalist who has criticized NBC's coverage of the London Olympics has been suspended from Twitter after using the site to publish a network executive's private e-mail address and urge followers to message him. Guy Adams, the Los Angeles correspondent for London's Independent newspaper, said he was tossed from the site Sunday after a series of posts, beginning Friday, that were critical of NBC's decision to delay airing the Games' Opening Ceremony and other events. "The man responsible for NBC pretending the Olympics haven't started yet is Gary Zenkel," read one post from Friday referring to the network, which has exclusive broadcast rights to the London Olympics in the United States. "Tell him what u think!"  NBC has issued an apology for spoiling the results of teen swimmer Missy Franklin's gold medal-winning race. In the latest controversy during the network's highly rated Summer Olympics coverage, NBC ran a "Today" show promo on Monday night that revealed the outcome of the heavily anticipated 100-meter backstroke before the event was actually telecast. Now NBC's sports division, which has been pretty adamant about the merits of its tape-delay strategy as public criticism mounts, has issued a statement admitting the network screwed up. "Clearly that promo should not have aired at that time," said an NBC Sports spokesperson in a statement.  Unlike NBC, other TV networks aren't hoping to attract more than 200 million viewers as the London Olympics unfolds throughout the next 16 days. That said, they're certainly not going to make the ratings game any easier on the National Broadcasting Company, which reportedly shelled out $1.18 billion for the U.S. rights to air the games. (That's about $286 million more than they paid in 2008.) "One of TV's first great reality shows," the Olympics used to be one of the few original programs to air during the summer, said Ron Simon, a curator at the Paley Center for Media.
