 Despite President Donald Trump's move on Friday to increase tariffs on $200 billion of China's exports, the end to the US-China trade war may soon be within reach. If and when that happens, the question will be whether the United States can achieve lasting commercial "peace" with China.

On the contrary, his tariffs have cost American consumers and businesses and cut off our ranchers and farmers from selling to China.  Since the United Kingdom voted for Brexit three years ago, the European Union has been struggling to work out a structure for its future relations with the country. While debates about the unpredictability of economic and political relationships between the EU and Britain continue to linger, thousands of miles away, the African Union (AU) is creating a close-knit relationship among its own 55 member nations. In 2013, the AU designed Agenda 2063, a framework with set objectives to aid the socio-economic transformation of the continent over the next 50 years. The vision is to maintain integration of Africans on the continent, according to Khabele Matlosa, the organization's Director of political affairs.  Oysters from an estuary in Mexico have been linked to a spate of illnesses in the United States, public health authorities announced Friday. At least 16 people from five states have come down with gastrointestinal illnesses traced back to oysters harvested from an estuary in Baja California Sur, Mexico, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two people have been hospitalized, and there have been no reported deaths. The agency, which is investigating the outbreak, warned consumers to refrain from eating or selling oysters from the estuary in question, Estero El Cardon, whose growing area has been closed since Tuesday.
