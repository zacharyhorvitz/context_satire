 David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the creators of HBO's "Game of Thrones," are exiting the Star Wars trilogy they had been set to write and produce. The first film in the series was supposed to arrive in theaters in 2022. The two said in a statement that their new production deal with Netflix made it impossible to work on the trilogy. Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of House of Cards: "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now. Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher book series was almost adapted into a standalone Netflix film but Kelly Luegenbiehl, Vice President of International Originals at Netflix, dissuaded the producers. She recalled asking them, "How can you take eight novels and just turn it into a film? There's so much material here. Through a number of conversations, the producers got really excited about the idea of using the source material for a longer-running series."
