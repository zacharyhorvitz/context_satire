 US President Trump described Queen Elizabeth II as a "tremendous woman" in an interview with The Sun newspaper, hours before he and first lady Melania Trump are due to meet the monarch for tea on Friday. "She is a tremendous woman," Trump told the newspaper during his UK working visit. "I really look forward to meeting her. I think she represents her country so well."  President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump have arrived in Brussels for the first of four European stops in a high-stakes diplomatic visit. The first lady kicks off her agenda Wednesday participating in a Belgian-hosted event alongside other NATO leaders' husbands, wives and partners, followed by a ceremony and dinner. "Well, it's going to be an interesting time," the President told reporters Tuesday as he walked out of the residence, the sunglasses-clad first lady standing silently by his side. And while the first lady isn't set to give any formal remarks during the trip -- which began in Belgium, and includes stops in the United Kingdom, Scotland and Finland -- her presence is sure to make headlines of its own.  It's Melania Trump's inaugural trip to England as first lady and in addition to meeting with locals, she's looking forward to getting the royal treatment. "Certainly, meeting with veterans and local school children will be a highlight," Trump's spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham tells CNN. "And she is also looking forward to having tea with the Queen." Before President Donald Trump meets on Friday with United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May, he and the first lady will enjoy a slightly more informal evening, albeit at a sprawling country palace in Oxfordshire, England, a bucolic rural region 60 miles outside of London.
