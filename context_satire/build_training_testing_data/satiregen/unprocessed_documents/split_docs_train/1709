In February 2014, Derek Muller used his YouTube account Veritasium to upload a video titled "Facebook Fraud". Within three days, the video had gone viral with more than a million views (it has reached 2,521,614 views as of June 10, 2014). In the video, Muller illustrates how after paying US$50 to Facebook advertising, the "likes" to his fan page have tripled in a few days and soon reached 70,000 "likes", compared to his original 2,115 likes before the advertising. Despite the significant increase in likes, Muller noticed his page has actually decreased in engagement â€“ there were fewer people commenting, sharing, and liking his posts and updates despite the significant increase in "likes". Facebook Dating first launched in Colombia on September 20, 2018. Users contributed to establishing what the dating site would look like for future users, as it was still in the testing stages. Facebook stated that if the testing went well, it would become a more prominent part of the existing Facebook application. Laurence Richards, portrayed by Rishard Beckett, first appeared on 24 May 2019, and made his final appearance on 5 June 2019. Laurence's backstory is that when he was born to parents Estelle and Tye Vere (Suzette Llewellyn and Daniel Hill), they didn't anticipate him to have Down's syndrome. Unsure of what to do, they left a newborn Laurence at the hospital. When Laurence's brother, Sid Vere (Ashley Rice), learns of this, he contacts an adoption agency to help them track Laurence down.
