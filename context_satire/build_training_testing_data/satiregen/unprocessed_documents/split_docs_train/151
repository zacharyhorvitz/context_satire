 Arnold Schwarzenegger said he dealt with his multiple affairs, like other big moments in his life, by denying them -- even, and at times especially from his wife. "That's the way I handled things, and it always has worked," the action hero-turned-politician said in an interview Sunday night on CBS' "60 Minutes." "But it's not the best thing for people around me." For instance, Schwarzenegger admitted that he had wanted to hide his heart surgery in 1997 from his then-pregnant wife of 11 years, Maria Shriver. In the 1980s, Schwarzenegger became his primary character in two film franchises: as Conan in the Conan series and as The Terminator in the Terminator series. His other film roles include Commando, The Running Man, Predator, Total Recall, Last Action Hero and True Lies. Although Schwarzenegger's acting career was put on hiatus due to his position as Governor of California, he also made several cameos in various films while in office, including The Kid & I and The Expendables. On February 11, 2011, just over a month after leaving office, Schwarzenegger announced he would return to acting.  A new book detailing Arnold Schwarzenegger’s life from bodybuilder to governor hit stores on Monday. Schwarzenegger’s memoir, “Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story,” reveals details about his life, including the movie star’s infamous affair with his housekeeper that led to divorce from Maria Shriver. Margita Thompson, Schwarzenegger’s press secretary from his first term as governor, speaks about the former bodybuilder’s new book and revealing “60 Minutes” interview from Sunday night.
