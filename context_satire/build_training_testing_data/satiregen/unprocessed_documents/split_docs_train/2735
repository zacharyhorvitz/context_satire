She began her television career in 1950, with performances on live television dramas on Studio One, Armstrong Circle Theatre, Goodyear Television Playhouse, and other acclaimed series. As a Warner Brothers contract player, she had her most famous role as Sandra Dee's heartless mother in A Summer Place (1959), in which her abused husband Richard Egan had a memorable scene telling her off for her outdated prejudices, and Ford arranges for Dee to be tested for her virginity. Another shocking scene had Ford slapping Dee so hard that she fell into a Christmas tree which toppled over on her. In Rome Adventure (1962) she played Daisy Bronson, owner of a bookstore in Rome, opposite Suzanne Pleshette and Troy Donahue, being kinder to him than she had been in A Summer Place. On The Edge of Night, Ford played the murderous theatre owner Eve Morris. Following that stint, she joined Another World, where from 1967 to 1992, she played the role of Ada Davis, the strong-willed mother of Rachel (Robin Strasser and later Victoria Wyndham). While her mother character was a total contrast to her role of Helen in A Summer Place, she was brutally tough and honest, yet supportive and loving and became a mentor to many of Bay City's young characters who were no relation to her. Her first line upon entering the room was responding to brother Sam Lucas's inquiry, "Ada, is that you?" 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter was later retitled 8 Simple Rules following Ritter's death and continued for one and a half more seasons until the network canceled it in 2005. Ritter's character, Paul Hennessy, was said to have died after collapsing in a grocery store while buying milk. ABC aired the first three episodes of the show's second season that had been taped before his death, each of which was introduced by Katey Sagal. The remainder of the show dealt with the family trying to grapple with Paul's death.
