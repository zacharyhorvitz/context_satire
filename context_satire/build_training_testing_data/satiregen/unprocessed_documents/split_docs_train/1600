Peachtree Corners government received the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, as well as, for the second straight year, the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award, both from the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada. Peachtree Financial gives structured settlement recipients the option to receive their cash sooner, by selling their structured settlement payments. These regular payments from insurance companies, often as a result of a personal injury lawsuit, can be sold in portions, or all at once. All structured settlement payment transfers require a court approval, in order to protect the individual, according to the Structured Settlement Protection Act for that state. Team 9 is a specialized team that acts as a hybrid farm team and practice squad for the league, and was inspired by a similar scheme employed by NFL Europe. It holds a maximum of 40 players at a time and is meant to prepare players for call up to one of the XFL's 8 teams to fill roster vacancies due to injuries of other players or if the teams see a player as a "hidden gem". The team shares practice facilities and support staff with the Dallas Renegades but maintains its own coaching staff; its head coach is Bart Andrus and is assisted by Pete Kuharchek and Peter Vaas.
