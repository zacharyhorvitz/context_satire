Team Change: The next day, after a conversation with Ariel (who initially wanted to transfer) about stepping up as a leader, Mia volunteered to move back to the red team. This makes Mia the third person in the show's history to switch back to their original team, after Autumn from season seven and Trev from season eight. Immediately afterwards, however, Ramsay announced that the chefs would be competing in a series of challenges to win a black jacket, and the lone chef who did not win one would be sent home. Sotomayor long lived in Greenwich Village in New York City and had few financial assets other than her home. She enjoys shopping, traveling, and giving gifts and helps support her mother and her mother's husband in Florida. Regarding her short financial disclosure reports prior to her Supreme Court nomination, she has said, "When you don't have money, it's easy. There isn't anything there to report." The next morning, Ramsay brought in Ariel's and Mia's parents. He took the final two to brunch, where he announced that Six Flags Magic Mountain had been closed for the day, and they would be able to ride the rides with their parents all afternoon including Viper. Ariel and Mia quickly realized that both of their menus were quite similar, due to their desires to incorporate their respective Latin heritages. That evening, Ramsay and his daughter Holly joined them and told them there was one more roller coaster to go on that had not yet been opened to the public: Full Throttle.
