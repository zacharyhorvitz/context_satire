The speed with which a U.S. community could be transformed into what was essentially a police state. To recap, a few nights after the Boston marathon bombing in 2013, two men, Dzhokar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, were implicated in the bombing ... During the ensuing night chase, Tamerlan was shot and killed by police while Dzhokar evaded arrest. Within hours, there was a citywide manhunt and Boston authorities advised citizens to shelter in place ... The city basically shut down while armed police and military vehicles scoured the streets for the bad guy.  After a 24-hour manhunt that paralyzed the Boston area, authorities captured the suspect in this week's marathon bombings. In the aftermath, his older brother -- also a suspect -- lay dead, and so did a police officer believed killed by the two. A quick glance at the five major developments. CAPTURED  Police arrested Dzhokar Tsarnaev, 19, after a long night of terror and mayhem in the Boston area. On the afternoon of the bombing, the New York Post reported that a suspect, a Saudi Arabian male, was under guard and being questioned at a Boston hospital. That evening, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said that there had not been an arrest. The Post did not retract its story about the suspect, leading to widespread reports by CBS News, CNN, and other media that a Middle Eastern suspect was in custody. The day after the bombing, a majority of outlets were reporting that the Saudi was a witness, not a suspect.
