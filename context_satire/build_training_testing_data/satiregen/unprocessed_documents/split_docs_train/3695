Police are searching for the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing this morning, identified by Boston police as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, age 19.

According to a source briefed on the investigation, the suspects are originally from the Russian Caucasus and had moved to Kazakhstan at a young age before coming to the United States several years ago. Eric Machado went to high school with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the suspect who is still on the loose. The speed with which a U.S. community could be transformed into what was essentially a police state.
