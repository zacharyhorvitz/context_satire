 This morning, Newark Mayor Cory Booker tells Soledad O'Brien on "Starting Point" what he's looking forward to seeing in tonight's highly anticipated vice presidential debate with Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan. The pressure is focused in particular on Biden, who many expect will have to do the heavy lifting in terms of changing momentum after President Obama's much-criticized debate performance against Mitt Romney. "If you want an authentic politician, there's no more raw, authentic politics than you get from the vice president," Booker says. "He is who he is. Donald Trump responded to Romney's initial press release scheduling the speech by describing it, in a post to his Twitter account, as "another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack  Obama". On March 3, the morning of the speech, Trump telephoned the Today Show and attacked Romney as a "stiff" who had, as a presidential candidate, "failed twice".  With time running out and the final debate next week on foreign policy, Tuesday night's showdown was the last best chance for President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney to win on the major issue of the campaign -- the economy. The contentious debate in New York featured pointed personal and political attacks by both men standing within arm's length of each other. Obama comes on strong, Romney stands ground in second debate Obama demonstrated two things -- he wants to keep his job and he listened to critics who panned him for being disengaged at their first debate two weeks ago. In Round Two, the president pulled few punches and attacked Romney from the start.
