On March 31, 2010, The Today Show ran a segment detailing the deaths of three separate adolescent girls and trolls' subsequent reactions to their deaths. Shortly after the suicide of high school student Alexis Pilkington, anonymous posters began trolling for reactions across various message boards, referring to Pilkington as a "suicidal CUSS", and posting graphic images on her Facebook memorial page. The segment also included an exposé of a 2006 accident, in which an eighteen-year-old student out for a drive fatally crashed her father's car into a highway pylon; trolls e-mailed her grieving family the leaked pictures of her mutilated corpse.  Facebook is expanding its investigation into potential Russian meddling in Britain's vote on membership in the European Union. The company told the head of a U.K. parliamentary committee on Wednesday that it would broaden its search for activity aimed at influencing the 2016 Brexit referendum. "We are committed to making all reasonable efforts to establish whether or not there was coordinated activity similar to that which has been found in the U.S.," Facebook wrote in a letter to Damian Collins, the lawmaker who chairs the committee. Facebook previously looked for evidence of interference in pages run by the Internet Research Agency, a troll army based in St. Petersburg that has ties to the Kremlin. Facebook initially refused to remove a “business” page devoted to a woman’s anus, created without her knowledge while she was underage, due to other Facebook users having expressed interest in the topic. After Buzzfeed published a story about it, the page was finally removed. The page listed her family’s former home address as that of the “business”.
