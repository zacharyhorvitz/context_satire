In 1998, in the midst of setbacks during the Nine Lives Tour, the band released the single "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing", the love theme, written by Diane Warren for the 1998 film Armageddon, starring Steven Tyler's daughter Liv. The song became Aerosmith's first and only number 1 single when it debuted at the top position on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed on top of the charts for four weeks. The song was nominated for an Academy Award in 1999. The song helped open Aerosmith up to a new generation and remains a slow-dance staple. The album opens with "Make It" and the appropriate opening line, "Good evening, people, welcome to the show, got something here I want you all to know." The song, composed by Tyler, who had struggled in a slew of local bands before Aerosmith, encourages listeners to succeed in achieving their dreams and not letting anything stop them, much like Aerosmith in their early club days performing up to three shows a day trying to get a record deal. "Somebody" is driven by a basic blues guitar riff and Tyler's lyrics tell the story of a character trying to search for the woman of his dreams. Written by Tyler and his friend Steven Emspak, "Somebody" was released in June 1973 as the B-side to the "Dream On" single. I Don't Want to Miss a Thing is the eighth studio album released by American country music artist Mark Chesnutt. His last album for the Decca Records label, I Don't Want to Miss a Thing produced two singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including a cover of the Aerosmith song of the same name, which reached Number One on the country charts, becoming the final Number One of his career thus far. This cover was also Chesnutt's biggest crossover, reaching Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. Only one other single was released from this album: "This Heartache Never Sleeps", which reached #17 on the country charts.
