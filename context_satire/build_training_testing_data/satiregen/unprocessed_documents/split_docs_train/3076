 Rich Americans. That's our global reputation. The numbers seem to back it up. Americans' average wealth tops $301,000 per adult, enough to rank us fourth on the latest Credit Suisse Global Wealth report.  Native Americans have been news in mainstream media recently, which is a rare occurrence. On Wednesday, the U.S. patent office canceled trademark registrations of the Washington Redskins team name, calling the word "disparaging to Native Americans." Amanda Blackhorse, a Navajo, was one of five plaintiffs to contest the federal trademark protection of the team name. This is a great victory for Native Americans and it's indicative of the growing chorus of people who oppose the use of such racial slurs.  America's relationship with the rich is complicated. Most of us are concerned about inequality and aren't inclined to respect someone just because they have money. But we also love the self-made millionaire -- the entrepreneur who got rich by their own smarts and hard work. Why we love 'em "Americans are fascinated by the rags-to-riches idea," said Kim Weeden, director of the Center for the Study of Inequality at Cornell University.
