 The decision to strip Indian-administered Kashmir of its autonomous status would free it of "terrorism," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a televised address Thursday. Modi claimed that Article 370, a constitutional provision which had granted special status and powers to the state, had caused "separatism, terrorism, dynastic politics and corruption." "As a nation, we have taken a historic decision," Modi said. "Due to the past system, the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh were deprived of many rights, which was a major obstacle in their development.  At least 17 are dead after a Pakistani army plane crashed into a residential area in the major city of Rawalpindi early Tuesday morning, the country's military said in a statement. Locals reported hearing a loud explosion at about 2 a.m. after seeing a plane flying unusually low over the city. "It was very, very low, unlike the planes that usually fly over the area," said restaurant worker Irfan Zareen. "Suddenly, the plane started doing somersaults in the air and abruptly crashed."  Pakistan's Parliament will hold a special joint session Tuesday to discuss India's decision on Kashmir and "rising tensions along the line of control," according to a presidential decree from Pakistani President Arif Alvi. The session is scheduled to begin at 11am local time (2aET). A bill to reorganize and reclassify the state of Jammu and Kashmir has been approved by the Rajya Sabah -- the upper house of India's parliament -- with 125 votes in favor and 61 against. It sets out to change Jammu and Kashmir's classification from a state to what in the Indian constitutional system is called a union territory, and carve off an area called Ladakh into a separate union territory.
