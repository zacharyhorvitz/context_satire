This was the first event of the second year of the Bellator European Series. The event was to be headlined by a bantamweight bout between James Gallagher and Cal Ellenor. However, on February 4, it was announced that Gallagher pulled out of the event due to a back injury, thus a women's featherweight bout between Leah McCourt and Judith Ruis was bumped to the main event. Gallagher is married to Paula Harwood and has two children, James and Kathryn. His daughter Kathryn is an actress and singer, and in 2015 performed in Deaf West Theatre's production of Spring Awakening on Broadway as the voice of Martha. In November 2019, she began starring as Bella in Jagged Little Pill at the Broadhurst Theatre. Kathryn hosts a vlog for Broadway.com called Jagged Little Thrill, in which she chronicles the backstage happenings of the production. Gallagher was born in Wilmington, Delaware, and was raised there with his two older sisters. His parents, John and June Gallagher, are folk musicians. He eventually went on to play in numerous bands, including Not Now Murray, What Now, Annie's Autograph, and Old Springs Pike. Gallagher played Tom Sawyer as a child actor at the Delaware Children's Theatre.
