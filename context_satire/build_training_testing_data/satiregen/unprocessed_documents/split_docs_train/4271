 The Met Gala and its flexible theme, "Camp: Notes on Fashion," inspired a glitzy and a varied array of looks at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on Monday night. And those looks, in turn, sparked a few thousand memes. The internet reveled in dissecting and poking fun at the most eye-catching fashion statements -- and no one received the social media treatment more than Lady Gaga. The star's choice was hotly anticipated and she didn't disappoint, making an elaborate entrance that involved not one but four different outfits. Gaga credits Joanne with helping her overcome addiction problems, and dedicated The Fame Ball Tour to her. The singer tattooed the date of Joanne's death on her left biceps, between lines of a verse from a poem by Rainer Maria Rilke. The singer's parents opened a restaurant called Joanne Trattoria in New York in 2012. Gaga has often said that although she never met her, Joanne was "one of the most important figures in my life". Gaga recruited Jeff Koons into the project in early 2013, with the two having previously met at a Metropolitan Museum of Art fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga provided a live performance. According to Koons, she "just kind of grabbed ahold of me and gave me a big hug around my waist " and replied, "You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park I would talk to my friends about your work." Following her hip surgery in February 2013, the singer was forced into a six-month hiatus, during which she studied literature and music with the Haus of Gaga in addition to sharing "creative gifts". This stage allowed her to review and enhance her creative direction, which she admitted to be a meticulous "gazing process".
