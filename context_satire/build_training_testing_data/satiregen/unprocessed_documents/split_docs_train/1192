While at the University of Tennessee, Colquitt had a well-publicized saga with alcohol problems. He was first suspended from the University of Tennessee football team in March 2004 after three alcohol-related arrests, despite having only arrived on campus in 2003. In his junior season, he was suspended for the first five games of the season and had his scholarship stripped after being arrested on charges of DUI and leaving the scene of an accident. During the three years that the show was produced at Cotton Hall, a number of professional actor were featured who have since had success on Broadway and in the music industry. Character actor Peter Lewis created the role of 'Old Man Scrooge' in 2003 and repeated it in 2004. Singer and actor Rubin Singleton created the role of 'Tiny' in 2003 and repeated it in 2004 before landing a recording contract and performing with Beyonc√© and Josh Groban. Karen Beyer, who also choreographed Swamp Gravy and Christmas Carol, created the role of 'Missionary Lady' before going on to appear as a regular in the Lifetime Channel's series Army Wives. About half a year after this encounter, Geer came to Colquitt and met with the Colquitt/Miller Arts Council. The project was called "Swamp Gravy," in honor of the soup made in southwest Georgia fishing camps comprising whatever vegetables are available, fried fish, a bit of fat, and whatever else might happen to be around.
