Jimmy Sexton, an American, was forced to close his checking account at Volksbank in Austria earlier this year. And Genevieve Besser, an American living in Germany, was given two months notice last year to close her securities account at ING-Diba, the German arm of Dutch bank ING.  The militants carrying out a terrorist attack at a mall in Kenya include American teenagers, the Kenyan government says.
