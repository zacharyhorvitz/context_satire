Republicans won back control of the House of Representatives in the November general election, with a net gain of 63 seats, the largest gain for either party since 1948. The GOP also picked up six seats in the Senate, falling short of retaking control in that chamber, and posted additional gains in state governor and legislative races. Boehner became Speaker of the House while McConnell remained as the Senate Minority Leader. In an interview with National Journal magazine about congressional Republican priorities, McConnell explained that "the single most important thing we want to achieve is for (Barack) Obama to be a one-term president".  The fate of endangered Democrats, vulnerable Republicans and control of the Senate will be decided in a matter of hours Tuesday as voters across the country head to the polls to chart the direction of the country for the next two years. That is, of course, assuming control of the Senate does not hinge on razor-thin victories that trigger recounts and possibly runoff elections in two states. Election Night will deliver clarity as well as confusion. There will, of course, be individual winners and losers, and the GOP is expected to easily hold, if not build upon, its majority in the House. After the election of Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1992, the Republican Party, led by House Republican Minority Whip Newt Gingrich campaigning on a "Contract with America", were elected to majorities to both Houses of Congress in the Republican Revolution of 1994. It was the first time since 1952 that the Republicans secured control of both houses of U.S. Congress, which with the exception of the Senate during 2001–2002 was retained through 2006. This capture and subsequent holding of Congress represented a major legislative turnaround, as Democrats controlled both houses of Congress for the forty years preceding 1995, with the exception of the 1981–1987 Congress in which Republicans controlled the Senate.
