 President Barack Obama said federal law enforcement officials are investigating the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando as an act of terrorism. "We know enough to say this was an act of terror and an act of hate," Obama said in a brief statement from the White House on Sunday afternoon. "The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terror. We will go wherever the facts lead us ... What is clear is he was a person filled with hatred."  The rampage at a gay nightclub in Orlando Sunday drew universal condemnation from both parties but exposed deep divisions over how to respond, with President Barack Obama urging new gun laws and Republicans largely silent on the issue. At least 49 people were killed and 53 more wounded in what is now the deadliest mass shooting in American history. Democrats, led by President Obama, made a now-familiar call for tighter gun laws. Many Republicans simply expressed their condolences and condemned the attack while Donald Trump blasted Obama and Hillary Clinton for refusing to blame the violence on radical Islam.  The wife of Orlando nightclub shooter told the FBI that Omar Mir Seddique Mateen said he wanted to carry out a jihadist attack, though she denied knowledge of his plans to launch the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, a law enforcement official told CNN on Tuesday. FBI investigators don't believe Noor Salman was a co-conspirator in the attack that killed 49 people Sunday morning at Pulse, the source said. But authorities are looking into whether she should face charges for what she may have known of his intentions and possibly failed to report to law enforcement. The development comes as investigators try to understand what motivated Mateen to carry out the devastating attack.
