The band is seen playing their music against a completely white backdrop. 2-D is seen wearing a T-Virus shirt most likely referencing Resident Evil. Russel's cap then begins to mysteriously rise on its own, and the ghost of Del appears to be emerging from under it. He begins to rap, leaving the other band members dumbfounded, and the backdrop slowly develops dark clouds in the sky, and enormous tombstones start to burst out of the ground, and the scene becomes that of a cemetery, as a shower of rain and thunderstorm begins.  A movie that simultaneously indicts the FBI and the media comes with some baggage at this particular political moment. Yet director Clint Eastwood tells a mostly compelling, personal story -- with some very notable missteps -- in "Richard Jewell," a sympathetic look at the security guard who went from hero to media punching bag during 1996 Atlanta Olympics. At its best, the fact-based film examines how Jewell -- depicted early as an overzealous campus security guard, and a ripe object for ridicule -- fell victim to the ruthlessness of law-enforcement authorities desperate to make an arrest, and journalists eager for a headline. In its lapses, the film tumbles almost into caricature in the portrayal of its villainous characters, making it a much, much better movie when focusing on its namesake and the few stalwart figures supporting him. Eastwood began working on smaller, more personal projects and experienced a lull in his career between 1988 and 1992. Always interested in jazz, he directed Bird (1988), a biopic starring Forest Whitaker as jazz musician Charlie "Bird" Parker. Alto saxophonist Jackie McLean and Spike Lee, son of jazz bassist Bill Lee and a long time critic of Eastwood, criticized the characterization of Charlie Parker remarking that it did not capture his true essence and sense of humor. Eastwood received two Golden Globes for the film, the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his lifelong contribution, and the Best Director award.
