All three Super Bowl wins for the Cowboys in the 1990s were broadcast on NBC, who later gained majority control and then full ownership of its affiliate in the Dallas area, KXAS-TV. NBC's vice president of news and public affairs, J. Davidson Taylor, was a Southerner who, with producer Reuven Frank, was determined that NBC would lead television's coverage of the civil rights movement. In 1955, NBC provided national coverage of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s leadership of the bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, airing reports from Frank McGee, then news director of NBC's Montgomery affiliate WSFA-TV, who would later join the network. A year later, John Chancellor's coverage of the admission of black students to Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas was the first occasion when the key news story came from television rather than print and prompted a prominent U.S. senator to observe later, "When I think of Little Rock, I think of John Chancellor." Ross's various interviewees have included singers such as Johnny Cash, Sandi Patty, Amy Grant, Steven Spielberg, Noel Paul Stookey (of Peter Paul and Mary), Willie Nelson, Reba McEntire, and music promoter Marty Angelo, as well as spree killer David Berkowitz ("Son of Sam"). He remains with CBN and his interviews are still featured on The 700 Club. Over the years, Ross has filled in for Robertson on the show.
