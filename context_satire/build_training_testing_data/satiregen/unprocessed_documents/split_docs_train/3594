Bolton appears to review the placement of the paintings before the opening. Eccentric and detached, Bolton is uncomfortable with the amount of attention being paid to him. Forced to give a speech at that evening's party (where guests include the real John Bolton in a cameo appearance), Bolton quietly states that he simply "paints what he sees."  John Bolton, President Trump's national security adviser, seemingly hasn't met a war he doesn't love. Bolton was a prominent proponent of the Iraq War and he has never evinced any doubt about the wisdom of that decision, telling the Washington Examiner four years ago, "I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct." By contrast, last year President Trump said the Iraq War was "the single worst decision ever made." Just before he was installed a little over a year ago as Trump's national security adviser, Bolton advocated for a pre-emptive war against North Korea in the Wall Street Journal.  President Donald Trump and his most senior Cabinet officials have a message for the leaders in Iran -- it's just not quite the same one. National security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have threatened "unrelenting force" and "a swift and decisive response" to any Iranian provocation after saying intelligence indicates Tehran may intend to threaten US forces or allies in the region. Asked Thursday if there's a risk of military confrontation, Trump said, "I guess you could say that always, right?" and then delivered his central message.
