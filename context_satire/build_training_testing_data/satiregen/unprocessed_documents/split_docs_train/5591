Mills came to public attention when she was a model in 1993 and was involved in a traffic collision with a police motorcycle in London. The accident resulted in the amputation of her left leg below the knee, but she continued to model by using a prosthetic limb and later sold her story to the tabloid News of the World. From there, Mills attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where she was a member of Delta Gamma sorority. She completed one year of course work, then left to pursue a dancing career, gaining some early stage experience when she danced in summer stock productions. Her first professional acting role was in a production of Come Blow Your Horn at the Drury Lane Theater in Chicago. She later was cast in a touring production of My Fair Lady, which brought her to New York City. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 20.3 square miles (52.5 km²), all of it land. The city frequently annexes new areas to the west and east of its borders. The newest annexation was in 2018 when part of Kennecott Copper Mine's land was annexed in to make way for technology centers.
