 Donald Trump and the White House Twitter account indicated that the US would be hosting the next G7 summit at the President's resort in Miami earlier this week. But there are signs of easing up on that certainty. The White House may remove a tweet indicating he's solidified his Florida property as the next meeting location because the White House has not finalized its plans, a White House official told CNN on Wednesday. "President @realDonaldTrump shares the location of the next @G7 summit, hosted by the United States!"  On Thursday, Madeleine Westerhout, personal assistant to the President of the United States, was forced to resign in the wake of the revelation that she had talked about Donald Trump's family in an off-the-record dinner with reporters. Westerhout had worked hand-in-glove with Trump -- her office was right outside the Oval -- since shortly after he was elected President, making her one of a handful of aides who had served under Trump for the duration of his term. And now, she is out. Because, reportedly, a journalist at the dinner broke the "off the record" terms and told the White House what Westerhout had said about the first family. The Kennedy assassination spotlighted the bravery of two Secret Service agents. First, an agent protecting Mrs. Kennedy, Clint Hill, was riding in the car directly behind the presidential limousine when the attack began. While the shooting continued, Hill leapt from the running board of the car he was riding on and jumped onto the back of the president's moving car and guided Mrs. Kennedy from the trunk back into the rear seat of the car. He then shielded the president and the first lady with his body until the car arrived at the hospital.
