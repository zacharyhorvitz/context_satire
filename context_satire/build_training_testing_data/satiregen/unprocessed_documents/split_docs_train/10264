Forsyth and her father eventually returned to South Africa. To pre-empt the ANC's revelation of her defection, on February 3, 1989, the South African Police launched a propaganda campaign, through its Strategic Communications arm; Stratcom. Called 'Operation Yurchenko' the campaign claimed that Forsyth had been a highly successful spy. The claim received pages of coverage in the South African newspapers. Forsyth reported on his early activities as a journalist. His early career was spent covering French affairs and the attempted assassination of Charles de Gaulle. He had never been to what he termed "black Africa" until reporting on the  Nigerian Civil War between Biafra and Nigeria as a BBC correspondent. He was there for the first six months of 1967, but few expected the war to last very long considering the poor weaponry and preparation of the Biafrans when compared to the British-armed Nigerians. Forsyth escaped to the British Embassy in Luanda on 2 May 1988. Forsyth's presence at the embassy made headlines on 31 July 1988. The Angolan government initially refused permission for Forsyth to leave the country. The Angolan Ambassador to Zambia, Luis Neto Kiambata, said Forsyth was "a regional problem" because she was "spying in all the Frontline states" and that "President Kenneth Kaunda, as the Frontline States' chairman, should decide on whether she should be given a visa".
