The National Center on Education and the Economy (NCEE) is an American not-for-profit, policy analysis and development organization based in Washington, DC that first opened in 1988 in Rochester, New York. Its precursor, the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy, was established by the Carnegie Corporation of New York in 1985. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was established in response to a 1986 report by Marc Tucker, "A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century." This Board established the NCEE in 1988 with Tucker as founder, CEO, and president. In 1990, in partnership with the Learning Research and Development Center of the University of Pittsburgh, the NCEE's Tucker, co-founded the New Standards Project. They collaborated with "states, urban school districts, and private foundations" and involved "20,000 teachers in all aspects of the development process". The New Standards Project sought to "develop an alternative to traditional assessment instruments and techniques by designing new, complex performance tasks that more closely resemble tasks encountered outside of school, thereby providing a rich context in which students could demonstrate their knowledge and skills." In 2014, the Center on International Education Benchmarking partnered with the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) to support a bipartisan study group of state legislators from across the country investigating top-performing education jurisdictions around the world. CIEB supported the study group as it worked over two years to understand what has led to high student performance in those countries, provinces and states. And CIEB helped the study group members think about how what they learn could be adapted to improve the quality and effectiveness of education in US states for all young people. This work resulted in the groundbreaking report No Time to Lose: How to Build a World-Class Education System State by State.
