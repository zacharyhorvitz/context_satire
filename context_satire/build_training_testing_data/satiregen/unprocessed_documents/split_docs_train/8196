New York is a state located in the Northeastern United States. New York was one of the original thirteen colonies that formed the United States. With an estimated 19.45 million residents in 2019, it is the fourth most populous state. In order to distinguish the state from its city with the same name, it is sometimes referred to as New York State (NYS).  Measles has been diagnosed in 17 children in the Orthodox Jewish community in the Williamsburg and Borough Park neighborhoods in Brooklyn, the New York City Department of Health stated Friday. Some of the infected children, who range in age from 7 months to 4 years, have experienced complications including hospitalizations, but there have been no deaths. Three of the children were infected on a visit to Israel, where there is a large outbreak of the disease, the department stated. As of Sunday, Israel's Ministry of Health counted 1,334 measles patients, including a toddler who died from the illness last week.  In the summer of 2013, Michael Bloomberg, then the mayor of New York, held a press conference to announce that Spotify would open an office in the city and hire more than 100 engineers by the following year. Bloomberg touted the announcement by Spotify, a music streaming service founded in Sweden, as validation of his efforts to "make New York City the first choice for tech companies to launch and grow." Five years later, New York may be on the cusp of two landmark tech industry announcements that would dwarf that Spotify news and cement the Big Apple as a big tech hub to rival Silicon Valley. Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL) are reportedly planning massive New York expansions with thousands of new employees.
