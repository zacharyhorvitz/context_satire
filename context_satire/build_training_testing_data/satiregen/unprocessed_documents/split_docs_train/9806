 In the modern political world, conventions are supposed to be boring, at least when it comes to who the nominee will be. Cleveland has been anything but. After two nights of the Republican National Convention, what have we learned, and where do we go from here? The answer to the first question should be obvious -- as a movement, Never Trump was an unmitigated failure.  A split appears to be emerging among conservatives about who Donald Trump should choose as his vice president, as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee prepares to announce his running mate, according to conversations with several prominent Republicans. Members of the Council for National Policy -- a powerful conservative organization -- is meeting this week in Cleveland to discuss policy and political strategy ahead of the Republican National Convention. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus are among the speakers expected to address the gathering.  Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, already a top adviser on national security to Donald Trump, might soon find himself receiving a major promotion. The former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency has recently landed on the list of most talked about vice presidential possibilities. The presumptive GOP nominee is expected to make a decision this week before the Republican National Convention begins in Cleveland on Monday. Trump has said that he wants a D.C. political insider, but he may instead look to boost his national security credentials with Flynn.
