Morning is the period of time from sunrise to noon. There are no exact times for when morning begins (also true for evening and night) because it can vary according to one's lifestyle and the hours of daylight at each time of year. However, morning strictly ends at noon, which is when afternoon starts. Morning can be defined as starting from midnight to noon, or from sunrise (which varies throughout the year) to noon, or from when one wakes up to noon.Morning precedes afternoon, evening, and night in the sequence of a day.  Black and white images beamed to Earth could be some of the clearest close-ups of Pluto's surface humans see for decades, NASA says. The images, taken by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft, show craters, mountains and glacial terrain along a strip 50 miles (80 kilometers) wide. The spacecraft took them in July during its closest flyby of Pluto --- which is at a distance from Earth that varies from 4.67 billion miles (7.5 billion kilometers) to 2.66 billion miles (4.28 billion kilometers) -- and they were among the most recent batch sent to back to our planet. "New Horizons thrilled us during the July flyby with the first close images of Pluto, and as the spacecraft transmits the treasure trove of images in its onboard memory back to us, we continue to be amazed by what we see," said John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut and the associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Early is a city located in Brown County in west-central Texas, in the United States. The population was 2,762 at the 2010 census. It is named for Walter U. Early, who donated land for the schools.
