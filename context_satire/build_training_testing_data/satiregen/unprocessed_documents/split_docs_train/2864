During instore promotions for the album, Kid Rock met and developed a friendship with local rapper Eminem, who frequently challenged Kid Rock to rap battles. Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast sold over 100,000 copies, signaling national success for the young Kid Rock; the album's success made Kid Rock one of the two biggest rap stars in Detroit in 1990, along with local independent rapper Esham. Despite the album's commercial success, Kid Rock was underpromoted by Jive Records; because the album contained "unprintable" explicit lyrics on every song, Jive found it difficult to market the album, producing few singles and no music videos. The album's lead single was a cover of Bad Company's "Feel Like Makin' Love". It was released October 2, 2003 to radio and peaked at number 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The song was performed on The Tonight Show, Big In 03 Awards and the American Music Awards for its promotional push. The promotional push was capped off by the VH-1 Special A Kid Rock Christmas.
