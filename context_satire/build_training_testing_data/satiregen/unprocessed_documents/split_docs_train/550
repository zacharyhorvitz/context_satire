Tour boats often take passengers on whale watching tours, though it is possible to do so from shore. The total cost of freeing Keiko was about US$20 million. The lead author of the study published by Marine Mammal Science said this in an interview: "You can't just let these animals out into the wild. You have to take the responsibility, and that might cost a lot of money. The fortune spent on Keiko might have been better invested in conservation programs to protect whales and their habitat ...
