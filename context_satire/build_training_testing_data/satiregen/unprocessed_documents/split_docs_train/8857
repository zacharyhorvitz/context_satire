Desmond "Tuppence" Moran, the brother of Lewis Moran, had publicly claimed to be out of the criminal business. On 17 March 2009 at about 8.50pm (AEDT), he was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt outside his home in Langs Road, Ascot Vale. As he sat in his car, a single bullet struck the steering wheel and was deflected from the driver. Moran was in the passenger seat, and witnesses claim to have seen the would-be killer fleeing immediately after firing the single shot. In July 2015, Moran took his latest stand-up show, "Off the Hook", to South Africa for the first time, performing three sold-out shows at the country's National Arts Festival. The North Island Credit Union Amphitheatre (formerly known as the Mattress Firm Amphitheatre, Sleep Train Amphitheatre, Coors Amphitheatre and the Cricket Wireless Amphitheatre) is a 20,500-seat amphitheatre located in Chula Vista, California adjacent to Aquatica San Diego. It is one of the larger concert venues in the San Diego area. The venue is currently owned and operated by Live Nation.
