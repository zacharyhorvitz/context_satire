Produced by DreamWorks before the split and was released by Paramount after the new DreamWorks was formed. Distributed by Paramount Pictures and United International Pictures. Note for the original Paranormal Activity that DreamWorks technically acquired remake rights way back in 2007, wanting to remake it with a bigger budget and the original director and then releasing the original as a bonus feature, but in the end the original $15,000 micro-budget film was released by Paramount after test screenings proved successful. The case reached the United States Supreme Court in 1948; their verdict went against the movie studios, forcing all of them to divest themselves of their movie theater chains. This, coupled with the advent of television and the attendance drop in movie ticket sales, brought about a severe slump in the movie business, a slump that would not be reversed until 1972, with the release of The Godfather, the first modern blockbuster. The distinctively pyramidal Paramount mountain has been the company's logo since its inception and is the oldest surviving Hollywood film logo. In the sound era, the logo was accompanied by a fanfare called Paramount on Parade after the film of the same name, released in 1930. The words to the fanfare, originally sung in the 1930 film, were "Proud of the crowd that will never be loud, it's Paramount on Parade."
