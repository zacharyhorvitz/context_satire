 Six women who climbed one of Europe's tallest buildings Thursday in an effort to rally against Shell's Arctic drilling plan have been arrested, according to London's Metropolitan Police. They were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass and taken into custody, according to the police. The women from the environmental group Greenpeace said they dodged security guards around The Shard and, once on top, they planned "to hang a huge work of art that captures the beauty" of the Arctic. It is believed the group first climbed onto the roof of London Bridge Station before accessing the outside of The Shard, the police said.  Capt. Robert Bartlett was awakened by a sharp crack, like a gunshot. His ship was sinking. "I heard a splitting, crashing sound," he later wrote.
