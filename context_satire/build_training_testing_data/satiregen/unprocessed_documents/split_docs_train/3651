On 6 January, Hyundai reported sales of December 2008 fell to 24,037, from 46,487 in previous year and sales for the year dropped 14%, a day after the company launched 'Hyundai Assurance'in order to spark sales amid tough economic conditions. Every year on the anniversary of the shootings, notably on the 40th anniversary in 2010, students and others who were present share remembrances of the day and the impact it has had on their lives. Among them are Nick Saban, head coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide football team who was a freshman in 1970; surviving student Tom Grace, who was shot in the foot; Kent State faculty member Jerry Lewis; photographer John Filo; and others. In 2017, Lewis appeared at the annual DEVOtional fan gathering in Cleveland, performing early Devo songs with Gerald Casale and others. This event was reportedly the first time Lewis and Casale had performed together in over 40 years.
