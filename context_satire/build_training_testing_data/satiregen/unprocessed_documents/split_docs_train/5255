The Iraqi List (Arabic: al-Qayima al-iraqiyaâ€Ž) is a political party list in the Iraqi National Assembly election, 2005, consisting of mainly secular Shia. It is dominated by the Iraqi National Accord led by former exile and interim prime minister Iyad Allawi. Other members include the Council of Iraq's Notables, the Iraqi Democrats Movement, the Democratic National Awakening Party, the Loyalty to Iraq Grouping, and the Iraqi Independents Association all of which are much smaller. In 2005 Iraqi election the Iraqi list received  13.82% of the votes, earning them 40 seats in the transitional National Assembly of Iraq. The Iraqis is an Iraqi political party led by Vice-President Ghazi al-Yawar. It was the largest Sunni party to participate in the January 2005 Iraqi election. During the election campaign, al-Yawar was President of Iraq, a then largely symbolic but still prominent position. The party consists of an alliance of Sunni tribal leaders, led by those of al-Yawar's Shammar tribe. The Iraqi diaspora refers to native Iraqis who have left for other countries as emigrants or refugees, and is now one of the largest in modern times, being described by the UN as a "humanitarian crisis" caused by the 2003 invasion of Iraq and by the ensuing war. The diaspora is formed of various ethnic and religious groups from Iraq, including: Arabs, Kurds, Iraqi Turkmen/Turkoman, and Circassians who are mostly Muslims (practicing Sunni or Shia Islam). In addition, there are also Christians communities within the diaspora, such as the Assyrians and Armenians as well as some Jews. There are also Yazidis and Shabaks within the Iraqi diaspora.
