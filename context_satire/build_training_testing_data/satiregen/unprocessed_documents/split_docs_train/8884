The company has been involved in numerous controversies, including its involvement with Dick Cheney – as U.S. Secretary of Defense, then CEO of the company, then Vice President of the United States – and the Iraq War, and the Deepwater Horizon, for which it agreed to settle outstanding legal claims against it by paying litigants $1.1 billion. In the run-up to the Iraq War, Halliburton was awarded a $7 billion contract for which only Halliburton was allowed to bid. Under U.S. law, the government uses single-bid contracts for a number of reasons, to include when in the view of the government, only one organization is capable of fulfilling the requirement. As a world leader in fracking, the company faces ongoing criticism regarding its ecological impact. The company has operations in over 70 countries, leading to inevitably complex relationships with foreign governments. Criticisms of Halliburton range from Iraqi War profiteering (related to U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney's prior role as Halliburton CEO) to the 2018 controversy in which the U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke was accused of smoothing the path for a Montana real estate deal that would directly benefit the Halliburton CEO at the time, David Lesar. In the face of these and other federal allegations, Zinke resigned in December 2018.
