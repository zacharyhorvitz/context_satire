 Former President Jimmy Carter was admitted Monday night to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta ahead of a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain, the Carter Center announced in a statement posted to Twitter. The pressure was caused by bleeding from his recent falls, the center said. Carter, 95, will undergo the procedure Tuesday morning. "President Carter is resting comfortably, and his wife, Rosalynn, is with him," the center said in its statement.  A small crowd gathered Tuesday at former President Jimmy Carter's church where they prayed for his recovery hours after he underwent an operation to relieve pressure on his brain from recent falls. "This week has been a trying week for our church. We have one of our favorite members in the hospital," said Rev. Tony Lowden, the pastor at Maranatha Baptist Church, Carter's church in Plains, a community of fewer than a thousand people about 160 miles south of Atlanta. In August 2015, Jimmy announced his cancer diagnosis, stating that it had spread throughout his body. At the time of the announcement, Betty Pope, cousin of the former president, attested to Rosalynn's strength and voiced her belief that the former First Lady would remain committed to her husband. Carter made her first public comments about the illness a month later in September, saying, "In spite of what's going on, it's been kind of wonderful just to know we have that kind of support, and also Jimmy's attitude is helping". In November 2015, she and her husband traveled to Memphis, Tennessee where they assisted in construction for the town's Habitat for Humanity affiliate.
