Marine Conservation Institute is a nonprofit organization and a leader in the global movement to protect the world's oceans. Working with scientists, politicians, government officials, and other organizations, Marine Conservation Institute is active around the world to protect vulnerable ocean ecosystems and the species within them. There is clear and unambiguous scientific evidence that documents how rising atmospheric carbon dioxide is leading to increasingly acidic seawater. This has been termed ocean acidification and presents a threat to marine organisms that build their structures of calcium carbonate and, by extension, the organisms that feed on and live among them. Marine Conservation Institute is working with partners from the scientific community, political arena, and coastal fishing and aquaculture industries to address the emerging threat of ocean acidification and the impacts on marine ecosystems. Another focus of conservationists is on curtailing human activities that are detrimental to either marine ecosystems or species through policy, techniques such as fishing quotas, like those set up by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, or laws such as those listed below. Recognizing the economics involved in human use of marine ecosystems is key, as is education of the public about conservation issues. This includes educating tourists that come to an area who might not be familiar with certain regulations regarding the marine habitat. One example of this is a project called Green Fins based in Southeast Asia that uses the scuba diving  industry to educate the public.
