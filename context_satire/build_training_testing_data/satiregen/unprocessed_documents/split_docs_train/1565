 Six members of the Newtown Strong team who ran the Boston Marathon on Monday are OK, according to a Facebook post from the group. "Members of the Newtown Strong team which ran in today's marathon are safe. All runners completed the race before the explosions happened," the post said. The runners ran the 26.2-mile event to honor the 26 people who were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14.  In the aftermath of dramatic events like Monday's bombing attack at the Boston Marathon, it's a truth of our times that millions of people will get early bits of news via social media. To be sure, sites like Twitter and Facebook were used extensively by police, relief groups and governments to share important information about the bombings. But there's also a more unfortunate side to how the Web responds to sudden bad news. Sometimes accidentally and sometimes maliciously, false information gets loose.  Investigators are tracking down some two-thousand leads this morning in their search for information regarding the Boston Marathon bombings. There are also new reports this morning that Boston-area hospitals have released at least 100 of the 183 people injured in Monday's attack. New details about the lives of the three people killed including a Chinese graduate student who was studying at Boston University are coming out as well. This morning Congressman Patrick Meehan (R-PA) joins “Starting Point.” Meehan serves as the chair of the House Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee and was briefed about the Boston Marathon bombing on Monday.
