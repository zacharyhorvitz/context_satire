 House Speaker Paul Ryan and several other top congressional Republicans are visiting the Southwest border next week to talk to local officials and border agents about plans to build a wall, a House GOP member involved in the trips said Tuesday. "The more people have knowledge of the Southern border the more they will understand what we literally can and cannot do," Texas Republican John Carter told CNN. "And that's important. They don't need to hear it from us, who live down there." Ryan confirmed on October 22, that he would seek the speakership after receiving the endorsements of two factions of House Republicans, including the conservative Freedom Caucus. Ryan, upon confirming his bid for the speakership, stated, "I never thought I'd be speaker. But I pledged to you that if I could be a unifying figure, then I would serve â€“ I would go all in. After talking with so many of you, and hearing your words of encouragement, I believe we are ready to move forward as one, united team.  House Speaker Paul Ryan insisted Tuesday he intends to pass legislation to dismantle Obamacare and replace it with a new system in 2017 despite suggestions by President Donald Trump that such a move might have to wait until next year. "The legislating is going to be done this year," Ryan told reporters after meeting with House Republicans. He said there "was a little confusion" after being asked about Trump saying in an interview that the process could extend into next year. Ryan repeated that the process on Capitol Hill will be done in 2017, but added, "the question is, how long does it take to implement the full replacement of Obamacare."
