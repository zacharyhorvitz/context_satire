While many political analysts came to assume during this time that Clinton would run, she took a long time to make the decision. While Clinton said she spent much of the two years following her tenure, as Secretary of State, thinking about the possibility of running for president again, she was also noncommittal about the prospect, and appeared to some as reluctant to experience again the unpleasant aspects of a major political campaign. Those around her were split in their opinions, reportedly, with Bill Clinton said to be the most in favor of her running again, Chelsea Clinton leaning towards it, but several of her closest aides against it. She reportedly studied Obama's 2008 campaign to see what had gone right for Obama as compared to her own campaign. On March 7, 2008, the 1984 Democratic vice-presidential nominee and Clinton finance committee member Geraldine Ferraro, gave an interview to the small California newspaper Daily Breeze in which she said, "I think what America feels about a woman becoming president takes a very secondary place to Obama's campaign â€“ to a kind of campaign that it would be hard for anyone to run against. For one thing, you have the press, which has been uniquely hard on her. It's been a very sexist media. Some just don't like her.  There's an independent senator -- a democratic socialist, no less -- with climate change on the brain making a real play for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton, who exudes establishment politics. What's the Green Party, which has been railing against the Democratic Party for years, to do in the year of Bernie Sanders? For Jill Stein, 2012 Green Party presidential nominee and current candidate, the answer seems to be keep on going. "Forward movement is a good thing, but I always include that it's not enough, and we have to have a base where we can truly build," Stein told CNN.
