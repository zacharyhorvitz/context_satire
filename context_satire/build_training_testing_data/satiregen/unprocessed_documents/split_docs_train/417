Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote, " only revealing moment is the tender Cory Monteith tribute "If You Say So" which exposes the raw nerves beneath Michele's scrubbed professional skin." Emily Longeretta of HollywoodLife wrote, "You will absolutely need to get your tissues ready. Lea previously revealed in interviews that her record was done before the death of Cory, but she wanted to add a few songs – and "If You Say So" was one of those songs. The lyrics speak for themselves, as they walk us through the last conversation Lea had with Cory, and how she felt the following week. Allison Keene of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review to the episode saying "Ultimately, "The Quarterback" was respectful, and was successful as the cathartic memorial—for both the cast and viewers—that it was intended to be. But beyond anything else that happened in the episode, the real sadness that stays with us about Monteith was said the best, as so many things usually are, by Sue: "It's just so pointless ... all that potential." While noting that Lea Michele's performance was the best, she said that "the most heartbreaking scene was without singing. Kurt, his father Burt (Mike O'Malley), and Finn's mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) all talked about the sadness and tragedy of losing a family member, and the moment when the three of them huddled together on the floor to cry and comfort one another was truly the episode's show-stopper." Monteith felt that Finn has had to grow up a lot during his time on the show. The actor said, "Finn started off as the stereotypical dumb jock but as the show has gone on, Finn's not dumb anymore, really, he’s just a little naïve." Early reviews of Finn from television critics were mixed; Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said that he and Michele were "both agreeable and a little desperate for an outlet" in the pilot episode.
