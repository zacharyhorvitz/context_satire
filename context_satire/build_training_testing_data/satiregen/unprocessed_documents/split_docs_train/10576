In December 2016, Quavo announced the collaborative album on Travis Scott's Apple Music Wav Radio show, previewing numerous recorded tracks. On April 3, 2017, it was further reported Scott had been working on a collaborative album with Atlanta-based rapper Quavo of Migos, with whom he previously worked with on the track "Oh My Dis Side" and the Young Thug collaboration "Pick Up the Phone". Speaking to GQ, he confirmed: "The Quavo album is coming soon. I'm dropping new music soon. Steinman requested for Tyler to send some of her previous albums for him to listen to. Though he was not impressed by the music she had recorded, he saw potential in her voice. She was invited to his New York apartment three weeks later, where he presented her with "Total Eclipse of the Heart", a song which became a trans-Atlantic number 1 hit in 1983. It was pulled from the RIAA Platinum-certified Faster Than the Speed of Night. Pacino refuses to do the commercial unless Jack gets him another date with Jill; to that end, Jack invites Jill on the cruise with his family. At sea, Jill refuses to see Pacino again, so Jack disguises himself as his sister and goes on her date with Pacino. Jill suspects that she was only invited just so Pacino would do the commercial; that is confirmed when she phones Jack, he answers as Jill, and she hears Pacino in the background. Pacino, still believing Jack to be Jill, spells out that he sees Jill as an unrecognized woman proud of her brother's success.
