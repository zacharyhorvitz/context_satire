When the Black Crowes severed their relationship with their original guitarist Jeff Cease, Ford was asked to fill the vacancy. He accepted the offer, and a few days later was asked by Slash  to join Guns n' Roses. Ford refused. At the time, Guns n' Roses were in the middle of a huge stadium world tour; Ford said in 2017 that he would probably be dead now, had he joined them. A 2016 photograph of Hill with Louis Farrakhan, long accused of anti-semitism, resurfaced in October 2018. He said he was unaware the image was being used for commercial purposes by the Nation of Islam website and would ask for it to be removed as it was inconsistent with "my values and my professional standards". He said he was utterly opposed to Farrakhan's then recent comparison of Jews to termites. In tweets at the time the image was more widely reproduced, Lamont Hill said that although he disagreed with Farrakhan on some issues, "I will not allow that to be an excuse for allowing dishonest media or poorly intentioned observers to create unnecessary division" adding he would "not be told who to speak to, sit with, or engage." The April in Paris Ball was an annual gala event whose mission was to improve Francoâ€“American relations, to share cultures, and to help provide assistance to US and French charities, aside from commemorating the 2000th anniversary of the founding of Paris. It was established by Claude Philippe, the hotel banquet manager, in 1952. While the hotel's management handled invitations and publicity, other details were coordinated by socialites. Elsa Maxwell was given the primary responsibility in organizing it.
