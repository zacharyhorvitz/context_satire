Morning is the period of time from sunrise to noon. There are no exact times for when morning begins (also true for evening and night) because it can vary according to one's lifestyle and the hours of daylight at each time of year. However, morning strictly ends at noon, which is when afternoon starts. Morning can be defined as starting from midnight to noon, or from sunrise (which varies throughout the year) to noon, or from when one wakes up to noon.Morning precedes afternoon, evening, and night in the sequence of a day.  Around 13,000 years ago, giant animals such as mastodons, mammoths, saber-toothed cats and ground sloths disappeared from the Earth. Scientists have found evidence in sediment cores to support a controversial theory that an asteroid or a comet slammed into Earth and helped lead to this extinction of ice age animals and cooling of the globe. It's called the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis and was first suggested in 2007. The hypothesis included the idea that an extraterrestrial body impacted Earth 12,800 years ago.  With extended stays in space becoming more commonplace and longer missions to the moon and Mars planned, scientists say there is a need to better understand the effects of microgravity on the heart. Past studies have shown that spaceflight can reduce the heart rate, lower arterial pressure and increase cardiac output. But new research examines how microgravity -- or zero gravity -- influences the human heart at the cellular level. "We've been able to check astronauts' health while they're in space and when they're back down but we've had no way to understand the molecular cell changes,"  said Joseph C. Wu of Stanford University's School of Medicine, who is also a senior author on the study.
