"Mr. Speaker, our Conservative government condemns the latest anti-Semitic outburst at York University. This week, chants of 'Zionism is racism' were heard, and one person was called a 'dirty Jew'. Alghabra ran as the Liberal candidate in the 2006 federal election in the riding of Mississaugaâ€”Erindale. He defeated Conservative candidate Bob Dechert by 3,328 votes. He served as the opposition critic for Citizenship and Immigration, and later for Natural Resources. He was defeated by Dechert in the 2008 election and again in the 2011 election. I was raised in areas where they don't believe in democracy and civil rights, cultures of equality and justice, and there is no belief that a citizen has the power over their own destiny...now I have a unique appreciation for Canada and what Canada has to offer, so it is that passion about striving to protect the idea and the noble concept of democracy.
