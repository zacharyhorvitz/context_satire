 Meghan, Duchess of Sussex has made a habit of modernizing Britain's royal family -- but the upcoming birth of her first child is set to overturn today's norms, harking back instead to the Windsor clan's past. The duchess is expected to follow in the footsteps of Queen Elizabeth II herself, by giving birth to her baby at home -- and she has reportedly hired a doula, or birth companion, to help her through the process. That would mean that, unlike her sister-in-law, Kate, or her late mother-in-law, Diana, Meghan wouldn't step into the glare of the world's media hours after giving birth. Both royals appeared for a photo call outside the Lindo Wing -- the private maternity ward at St. Mary's hospital in west London -- shortly after the delivery of their children.  Britain's Duke and Duchess of Sussex will keep details surrounding the arrival of their first child private, in a break with royal tradition of the past 40 years. "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very grateful for the goodwill they have received from people throughout the United Kingdom and around the world as they prepare to welcome their baby," Buckingham Palace announced in a statement Thursday. "Their Royal Highnesses have taken a personal decision to keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private. The Duke and Duchess look forward to sharing the exciting news with everyone once they have had an opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family." His parents announced their second son's name would officially be Prince Henry Charles Albert David, but that he would be known as Harry to his family and friends. As the prince grew up, he was referred to by Kensington Palace, and therefore the Press and the public at large, as Prince Harry. As a son of the Prince of Wales, he was called Prince Henry of Wales. Diana wanted Harry and his older brother, Prince William, to have a broader range of experiences and a better understanding of ordinary life than previous royal children.
