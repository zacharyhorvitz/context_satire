 Mike Pence hasn't been asked to join Donald Trump's ticket and hasn't received signals from Trump's campaign that an offer is imminent, a source close to Pence says. Pence, the first-term Republican governor of Indiana, is set to attend a fundraiser and a rally with Trump near Indianapolis Tuesday as Trump nears a decision on his vice presidential running mate. Speaking to reporters here Tuesday, Pence said he doesn't plan to meet one-on-one with Trump before the events. But he compared Trump to former president and GOP icon Ronald Reagan.  Chris Christie ripped into Ted Cruz's performance on the third night of the Republican National Convention, after the Texas senator was booed from the stage Wednesday night for declining to endorse Donald Trump. "I think it was awful. And quite frankly, I think it was something selfish," the New Jersey governor told CNN's Dana Bash. Christie, who is also a former 2016 rival, said Cruz broke the signed pledge he made to the Republican Party during the nomination process to support the eventual nominee.  Chris Christie conceded in an interview Tuesday he was "disappointed" that Donald Trump didn't pick him to be his running mate -- but he's already "over it." The New Jersey governor was one of the final three contenders in the running for the GOP vice presidential nomination, but Trump instead picked Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Christie said he knew he was "close," but didn't think he was going to make the final cut.
