Each episode, Harvard Sailing Team members and comedians Billy Scafuri and Adam Lustick discuss their history and relationship with a single topic. No Joke debuted on February 5, 2016. On their "Summer Anthems" episode, one of the songs discussed was Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe", which they identified as a perfect pop song. This led down a rabbit-hole of discussion of that singer, who they affectionately nicknamed "the Jeps". Billy and Adam have repeatedly expressed their admiration for, and perhaps obsession with, Carly Rae and ultimately aspire to have her as a guest on the podcast. Dash (voiced by Schwartzman) and his best friend Assaf (Watts) are sophomores at Tides High School, a school located at a cliff edge above a fault line. The friends write as a team for the school newspaper, edited by mutual friend Verti (Rudolph). But one day Verti assigns Assaf to write a story solo about the new auditorium opening in the top floor, and Dash clearly picks up a relationship forming between Assaf and Verti. Feeling angered and betrayed, Dash writes a hurtful article about Assaf that provokes Principal Grimm to put a mark on his permanent record.
