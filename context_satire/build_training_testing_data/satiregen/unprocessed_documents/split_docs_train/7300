 There's far less Trump bashing than you might imagine in the opening round of the 2020 presidential race, particularly from the lips of Democratic candidates who are trying something unusual: barely mentioning his name. President Donald Trump is an around-the-clock, all-consuming presence in American politics. He is one reason the contest is drawing so many Democratic contenders. Yet the word Trump often goes unspoken on the campaign trail. On March 4, 2019, Hickenlooper announced his campaign to seek the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in 2020. His candidacy had been a matter of media speculation for months before his announcement. Hickenlooper formally launched his campaign on March 7, 2019, in Denver, Colorado. A video titled "Stand Tall" was released to announce the campaign and outline his reasons for running.  Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper on Monday announced he is running for president, launching a 2020 campaign in which he will lean on his Western roots and decades of executive experience. He made the announcement in a video titled "Standing Tall," which tracks Hickenlooper's life from laid-off geologist, to owner of a brew pub, to mayor of Denver and to governor, and touts the Democrat's experience in a variety of fields as a key reason he should be the person to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. Hickenlooper casts the President as a "bully" in the more than two-minute video.
