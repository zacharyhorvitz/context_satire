The Environment and Conservation Organisations of Aotearoa New Zealand (ECO) was formed in 1971 under the name of CoEnCo and changed its name to ECO in 1976. It is a non-profit umbrella group and network of around 50 organisations and publish ecolink (ISSN 1174-0671), a quarterly newsletter sent out to members and supporters. In 1997, the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus became concerned with an ad campaign for Planters Deluxe Mixed Nuts. The initial commercial featured a man and monkey deserted on an island. They discover a crate of Planters peanuts and rejoice in the peanuts' positive health facts. Eco is a simulation game created by American studio Strange Loop Games, in which players have to work together to create a civilisation on a virtual planet. The game values a gentle use of natural resources and is used both as an entertainment and educational tool.
