He appeared in Furious 7 after his brother Paul died on November 30, 2013 in a single-vehicle accident. Cody and Caleb both stepped in to help finish their brother's scenes as Brian O'Conner in the movie, which was still filming at the time of Paul's death. Cody Beau Walker (born June 13, 1988) is an American actor. He is the brother of the actor Paul Walker, and helped complete his final scenes in the film Furious 7 (2015). He made his acting debut in Abandoned Mine (2013). He went on to appear in USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage (2016) and star in the television show In the Rough. Producer Neal H. Moritz, who had previously worked with Paul Walker on the film The Skulls (2000), gave the actor a script and offered him the role of Brian O'Conner. Originally, the studio told the producers they would green-light the film if they could get Timothy Olyphant to play the role of Dominic Toretto. Olyphant, however, who had starred in the previous year's car-themed blockbuster Gone in 60 Seconds, declined the role. Moritz instead suggested Diesel, who had to be convinced to take the role even though he had only played supporting roles up to that point.
