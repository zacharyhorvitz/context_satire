Harrison spent four years pitching the idea of making a show about a pawn shop after his shop was featured in the show Insomniac with Dave Attell in 2003, but his efforts did not yield success. In 2008, Brent Montgomery and Colby Gaines of Leftfield Pictures came up with an idea about a reality show based in a Las Vegas pawn shop and approached Harrison. The series was originally pitched to HBO, though the network preferred the series to have been a Taxicab Confessions-style series taking place at the Gold & Silver's night window. In a February 2009 YouTube video titled "Pawn star$", Corey Harrison promised to gun down an intruder with a handgun he displayed, and a woman screamed as she was removed from the store after demanding that the wedding ring her husband sold to the shop be returned. Karl Harriosn was a coach at Halifax, and then head coach at Keighley before moving to Bradford Bulls, where he worked for two years as an Assistant Coach under Brian Noble. He was appointed as head coach at Salford City Reds in June 2002, replacing Steve McCormack. Although he was unable to prevent Salford City Reds being relegated from Super League in 2002, Harrison remained, and led Salford City Reds to promotion back to the top tier of the sport at the first attempt, winning the Arriva Trains Cup on the way. Harrison claims that he was approached to take part in reality television show, I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! Lennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was "one of young follower and older guyÂ ...  was like a disciple of mine when we started." The two later bonded over their LSD experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter with Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives. In 1974 Harrison said of his former bandmate: "John Lennon is a saint and he's heavy-duty, and he's great and I love him.
