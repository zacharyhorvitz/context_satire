 With a possible government shutdown in five days, House Speaker John Boehner on Thursday signaled a shift in Republican tactics with the focus now on negotiating a compromise on raising the federal debt ceiling next month instead of a short-term spending plan now. He and other GOP leaders called on President Barack Obama to negotiate an agreement with them to increase how much the government can borrow to pay its bills in exchange for concessions they seek such as delaying the implementation of Obamacare. However, Obama later made clear that he rejected any political bartering on the debt ceiling. "I will not negotiate on anything when it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States of America," he said.  House Republicans pushed through a spending plan early Sunday morning that would delay Obamacare for a year and repeal its tax on medical devices. The vote makes the chances of a government shutdown Tuesday increasingly likely. That's because passage of the amendments sends a temporary budget resolution back to the Senate, where Democrats vow to again block the anti-Obamacare amendments. President Barack Obama has added a veto threat to that position.  What looked last week like a game of political hot potato has become a high-stakes game of chicken, with continued operation of the federal government and possible wider impact on the overall economy hanging in the balance. In a move that makes a shutdown appear very likely, House Republicans approved a spending plan early Sunday morning that would delay Obamacare for a year and repeal its tax on medical devices. The temporary budget resolution now goes back to the Senate, where Democrats have consistently said any changes to President Barack Obama's signature health care law would be a deal-killer. On top of that, Obama has already issued a veto threat.
