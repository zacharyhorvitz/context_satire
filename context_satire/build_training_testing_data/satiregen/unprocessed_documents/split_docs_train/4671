Hilliard was born on May 28, 1927, in Chicago, but lived in Arkansas until age 8, then moving to Portland, Oregon. As a youth, he applied for a job as a newspaper delivery boy for The Oregonian, but his application was rejected out of concerns that having a black delivery boy would not be acceptable to the paper's white subscribers. He graduated from Benson Polytechnic High School, where he had worked on the school newspaper, and spent a year in the U.S. Navy after being drafted at the end of the Second World War. At age sixteen, he wanted to impress his girlfriend of two years, Diana Osborn(e), who was an Elvis Presley fan and, although he had no record contract at the time, told her that he, too, was going to make a record. With his father's help, he secured a one-record deal with Verve Records, an important jazz label looking for a young and popular personality who could sing or be taught to sing. On March 26, 1957, he recorded the Fats Domino standard "I'm Walkin'" and "A Teenager's Romance" (released in late April 1957 as his first single), and "You're My One and Only Love". Lenny teaches his son how to shoot a perfect basketball shot, and the friends end the night dancing with their spouses. The next day, Roxanne busts Lenny for lying about canceling their flight before she agreed to stay, and he admits that he just wanted their kids to be normal for once. Eventually, everyone confesses how they feel with their lives: Deanne believes Kurt plans to dump her for the Feders' live-in nanny, but Kurt retorts that he only hung out with her because of Deanne's negligence; Eric reveals that he got laid off just before his trip and only acted like a big man so he wouldn't be the loser; Marcus had been feeling insecure about himself since reuniting with the old gang; all Rob admits is what everybody already knows: he wears a toupee. On their last day at the lake house, Lenny agrees to the rematch against their former opponents.
