It was announced that Jessica Simpson and then-husband Nick Lachey would star in their own MTV reality series, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica. The series, which chronicled Jessica and Nick's life as a married couple, became a pop culture phenomenon and helped draw attention to the Simpson sisters. Following the success of the series, it was confirmed that Ashlee would receive a spin-off series, The Ashlee Simpson Show. Hoping to end comparisons between her and her sister, Ashlee wanted the series to focus on the recording of her debut album. With the release of Sweet Kisses (1999), Simpson and her team marketed Simpson as "anti-sex appeal", as a contrast to artists such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera who had recently achieved success with their respective debut albums. The music found on her debut album mostly spoke on topics such as love, and Simpson announced that she would remain abstinent until marriage. Though the album sold four million copies worldwide, it failed to meet the expectations of Columbia Records; as a result, the label hoped to see Jessica mature her image for the release of her second album. Fraser Middleton of The Evening Times wrote that Simpson captured a "girl next door" image with her previous album and the music videos for its accompanying singles. Although the album was successful, Columbia Records felt it was far from the successes of her contemporaries, Aguilera and Spears and that Simpson needed to make some changes to her image. As a part of the change, she lost weight, dressed in a more sexy style and learned dance. Simpson said the video is a kind of "comic strip girl come to life" further explaining that the video was something she had never done before.
