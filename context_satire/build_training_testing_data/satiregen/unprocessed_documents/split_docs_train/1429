In celebration of Valentine's Day, which is also Johnny's birthday, Johnny invites everyone as he goes out in search of the perfect date. However, it seems that his mother had already arranged a date for him. Refusing to go with a girl his mother decided for him, he goes out on his own. Despite all his attempts, every single woman rejects him as usual, and he becomes deeply depressed at the worst birthday in his life. Much like its predecessors Hagar the Horrible, The Flintstones and the short-lived The Roman Holidays, Dave the Barbarian juxtaposes both the ancient and modern. Candy, for example, shops in the local mall and uses the crystal ball for online shopping sprees. Occasionally, the series even breaks the fourth wall with a character directly addressing the audience or even communicating to the narrator. Sunny tries to teach the class how to play and sing the blues, but Eddie can't figure out how, as he's never wanted for or desired anything in his life due to his riches. His lack of appreciation for material things only becomes clearer when his parents throw him a massive birthday party that he tires of almost immediately. Sunny gifts him with a compass that he claims will send him to the greatest present of all, and Eddie and Li'l D embark on a quest through Atlanta to find it--and discover how to appreciate what you have. Meanwhile, the other kids try to trick Eddie's staff into believing the birthday boy is still at the mansion so the festivities can continue.
