In the United States, gimmicks continued to be used to entice film-goers into theaters. William Castle's 1960 horror film 13 Ghosts was shot in "Illusion-O", where audiences were given a “supernatural viewer” that they could wear to see hidden ghosts in the film. In 13 Ghosts, a family searches for fortune inside the mansion of a reclusive doctor who died. They will need to search the house to find the doctor's fortune, but along with the property they have also inherited the occultist's collection of thirteen ghosts. On July 10, 2008, a Landmarks Commission official said that the petition to designate the building as a local landmark had been accepted for study, giving the building pending landmark status. Members of the group Citizens for City Hall also opposed Mayor Menino's plan to build a new City Hall on the South Boston waterfront because it would be a major inconvenience for tens of thousands of city residents. Although gruesome for the most part, some segments, such as "Citizen Kang" in Treehouse of Horror VII, satirize political issues. The opening segment of Treehouse of Horror XIX featured Homer attempting to vote for Barack Obama but a rigged electronic voting machine instead registers a vote for John McCain. Rather than taking sides in the election, Jean says it is "mostly a comment on what many people to believe to be the irregularities in our voting system." In Treehouse of Horror XVII, a segment called "The Day the Earth Looked Stupid" ends with Kang and Kodos taking over Springfield as part of a mission called "Operation: Enduring occupation".
