In "Are You There Frank? It's Me, Julien," Karl creates a special armor that allows him to pose as Frank the Sky God in order to get the Lemurs to oppose Frank's brother Larry the Volcano God by sacrificing King Julien. With help from Mort operating the Larry armor that Timo built, King Julien repels Karl. in "Revenge of the Prom", Karl reveals that he was in all of Julien's old high school classes, but Julien never noticed him. According to Masikura in "Viva Mort," Julien's uncle is the worst king because he did some things to other kingdoms and never apologized. Masikura told King Julien he doesn't have to be his uncle, when she is trying to help him apologize to Maurice. In the sequel Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, Maurice does not have a prominent role, basically agreeing to whatever King Julien says. In the series, he often acts like a strict big brother to Mort and knows him so well that in "The Penguin Stays in the Picture" he is shocked to find that Mort only ate half of his popsicle, prompting Skipper to go find him because he suspected Mort went missing, which was correct.
