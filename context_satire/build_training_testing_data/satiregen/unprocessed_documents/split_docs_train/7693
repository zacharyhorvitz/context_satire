Critical reception was mixed, Rolling Stone didn't bother to review the album, however Steve Clarke for the NME in a review praised the production work and said 'There is such a thing as the Stephen Stills sound and like Phil Spcetor and Brian Wilson's sound its a big aural landscap'". Concluding his piece with "Illegal Stills is a well paced album with a flowing sense of continuity totally absent from Stills and bears the marks of simply first grade rock talent." Many critics said there wasn't enough guitar playing from Stills, and there was too much influence from Donnie Dacus. So much so that people thought it could have been credited to both Stills and Dacus After the disintegration of Buffalo Springfield, Stills played on the Super Session album with Al Kooper and joined up with David Crosby, who had recently been ejected from the Byrds in the autumn of 1967. At a party in Laurel Canyon, Crosby was introduced to Graham Nash by a mutual friend, Cass Elliot (formerly of the Mamas and the Papas), and Nash found himself soon joining in singing with Crosby and Stills. Renditions of the latter's "You Don't Have to Cry," led to the formation of Crosby, Stills & Nash. Several of Stills's songs, including "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes" and "You Don't Have To Cry" on the group's debut album were inspired by his on-again off-again relationship with singer Judy Collins.
