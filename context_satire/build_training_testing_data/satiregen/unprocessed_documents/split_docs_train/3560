 As President Donald Trump considers deploying between 2,000 and 4,000 National Guard troops to the US-Mexican border, residents and law enforcement officials in border towns say they have mixed feelings about the news. While some welcome the support from the federal government, others feel it's a waste of resources. Here's what some of them told CNN. 'We have enough authority in town' Each night, citizen journalist Priscilla Villarreal takes to the streets of Laredo, Texas, to livestream footage of car accidents and crime scenes over Facebook.  Under fire from the White House, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona called President Donald Trump's approach to the border "stupid" and accused him of deploying the National Guard as a "political ploy." "I will gladly work with the President when his ideas aren't stupid and detrimental to the United States," Gallego said on CNN's "Newsroom" Thursday. "Unfortunately, this is what this plan is. It was not planned out."  US President Donald Trump's move to deploy the National Guard has not deterred a caravan of Central American migrants planning to cross through Mexico to the US border. Instead, the migrants will disperse into smaller groups after reaching Mexico City. While some will stay in Mexico to try to get refugee status there, others say they will continue north to the US border. Organizers of the caravan estimate that some 200 or so people will proceed all the way to the US border in the coming days, although the number could be higher.
