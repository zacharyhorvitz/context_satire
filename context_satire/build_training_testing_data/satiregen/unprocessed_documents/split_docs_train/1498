 Filing nervously into a sports hall in Mosul, northern Iraq, around 20 girls prepared to practice gymnastics. Compared to their male counterparts at Mosul University's Faculty of Sport, their number is small. Another difference is that the gates to the sports hall were locked behind them and an announcement made that the hall was exclusively allocated for women. Liqaa Abdul Muttalib, a rhythmic gymnastics trainer says the facilities are not ideal:  "There are pillars in the hall which limit free movement and rotational flips. Iraq has one of the world's oldest cultural histories. Iraq is where the Ancient Mesopotamian civilizations were, whose legacy went on to influence and shape the civilizations of the Old World. Culturally, Iraq has a very long and rich heritage. The country is known for its poets and its painters and sculptors are among the best in the Arab world, some of them being world-class.  Even during difficult times, Iraqi Airways is aiming high. Earlier this year Iraq's national carrier started expanding its route network for the first time in 23 years. It added flights between Baghdad and London, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, and even Kuwait. In the next few months, the airline is planning on adding connections to Copenhagen, Stockholm, Kuala Lumpur, and destinations throughout China, hoping ultimately to expand its network from 15 to 40 by 2017.
