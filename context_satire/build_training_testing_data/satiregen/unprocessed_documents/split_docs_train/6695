The Royal Chapel of St. Anthony of La Florida is sometimes named the "Goya's Sistine Chapel". The chapel was built on orders of King Charles IV of Spain, who also commissioned the frescoes by Goya. These were completed over a six-month period in 1798. The frescoes portray miracles by Saint Anthony of Padua, including one that occurred in Lisbon but that the painter has relocated to Madrid. On every June 13, the chapel becomes the site of a lively pilgrimage in which young unwed women come to pray to Saint Anthony and to ask for a partner. At a marketing meeting, the boss Cybill congratulates Nick for the ad in a magazine for the elderly which has paid off. When he takes the credit without mentioning it was Emma's idea, she calls him out, and requests the promotion she was promised. Cybill agrees.
