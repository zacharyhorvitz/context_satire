The description in this article is given from west to east. This is the more popular direction, and the one given in the original and most of the current guides, and is the direction which keeps the prevailing wind and rain at one's back, and the evening sun out of one's eyes. Some walkers do start from the east coast, either because they wish to have the Lake District as the climax of their walk or because they have already walked the route in the conventional direction. In July 1989, Hartley completed the Pennine Way in a record time of 2 days, 17 hours and 20 minutes. He ran the Way, approximately 268 miles, in the north to south direction, from Kirk Yetholm to Edale. He did not schedule any time for sleep during the run, and none was taken. His time took approximately four-and-a-half hours off the previous best which had been set by Mike Cudahy. Cornelius Vanderbilt, an entrepreneur from Stapleton, Staten Island, who would become one of the world's richest people, started a ferry service from Staten Island to Manhattan in 1810. Although Cornelius was only 16 years old at the time, he had sailed extensively enough in his father's periauger that he could easily navigate the New York Harbor Estuary on his own. He earned $100 for his birthday in May 1810, which he used to purchase a periauger called Swiftsure. Vanderbilt then used the periauger to transport passengers from Staten Island to the Battery at Manhattan's tip.
