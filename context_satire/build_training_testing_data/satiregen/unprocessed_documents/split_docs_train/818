 President Donald Trump may believe that it's easy for the United States to win a trade war. But Wall Street begs to differ. The Dow and S&P 500 are each down more than 4% since the beginning of May, while the tech-laden Nasdaq has fallen more than 7%. The slide in tech stocks even briefly pushed that index back into correction territory earlier this week.  Asia stocks jumped Wednesday, following Wall Street's rally as the US central bank signaled a rate cut and worries about the escalating trade war took a backseat. Tokyo's Nikkei led the charge, rising 1.9% in morning trade. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite gained around 0.5%. Driving the market upswing were comments from US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said that the central bank was closely monitoring developments on the trade front.  US stocks recorded their second best day of the year on Tuesday, rallying as hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut took hold and worries about an escalating trade war took a backseat. The Dow finished the day up 512 points, or 2.1% â€” its best day since January 4. The Nasdaq closed 2.7% higher, erasing its losses after a steep selloff on Monday that was driven by worries about tech regulation. The S&P 500, meanwhile, ended up 2.1%.
