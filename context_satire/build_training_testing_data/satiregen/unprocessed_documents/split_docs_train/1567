 While much attention remains on Texas and the destruction left by Hurricane Harvey and its historic rainfall, powerful Hurricane Irma is rapidly intensifying in the open Atlantic and poses a major threat to the Caribbean and potentially to the United States next week. With the storm still five days away from the outermost Caribbean islands and at least a week away from any potential US impacts, there is still a lot of uncertainty about where it will go. The range of possibilities presented by the forecast models more than a week out literally spreads from Mexico to Canada -- and everywhere in between. Irma was designated a tropical storm Wednesday morning, and by Thursday afternoon, it had strengthened into a large Category 3 hurricane, with winds of 115 mph.  A week after Hurricane Harvey slammed into the Gulf coast, the people of Texas are still reeling. They need food, water and shelter -- not the news that another hurricane has formed in the Atlantic Ocean. Yet Hurricane Irma is out there right now, growing in strength and tracking in a westward direction. Can anyone blame the beleaguered people of Texas and Louisiana for asking, "Is this storm going to hit here?"  Hurricane Irma strengthened to a Category 4 storm Monday, churning west in the Atlantic Ocean and prompting emergency declarations in Florida and Puerto Rico. Although Irma's path remains uncertain, the possibility it could threaten the United States led Florida Gov. Rick Scott to declare a state of emergency in all 67 counties in his state. "In Florida, we always prepare for the worst and hope for the best, and while the exact path of Irma is not absolutely known at this time, we cannot afford to not be prepared," Scott said in a statement released late Monday afternoon.
