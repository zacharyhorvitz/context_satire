The performance of Lester Holt as moderator of the debate received mixed reactions, with political critics stating that Holt struggled to keep control of the debate, and although he challenged both candidates, Holt's repeated attempts to get the candidates to adhere to the time restrictions were ignored.  Chances are you've never heard of Elaine Quijano. Unlike the other moderators chosen for this year's national debates, Quijano is not a household name. She is a digital news anchor -- the daytime anchor at CBSN, CBS News' 24-hour livestream channel -- and she's never moderated so much as a primary debate. But on Tuesday night, Quijano will preside over the vice presidential debate between Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, introducing herself to tens of millions of Americans in the process.  Tuesday's Vice Presidential debate was like a bad version of "Waiting for Godot": The questions lacked focus. The conversation meandered. The men spoke past one another. And the moderator intervened in very mysterious ways.
