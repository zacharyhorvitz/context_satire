New Hampshire () is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the west, Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. New Hampshire is the 5th smallest by area and the 10th least populous U.S. state. Concord is the state capital, while Manchester is the largest city. It can be said that the myriad doubts about the Warren Commission's findings in the death of President Kennedy represent a reverse situation. The doubts would never be taken seriously until they were inside the Beltway, in the halls of Congress, the courts and the White House. The 2016 Democratic Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders was quoted in an interview with Chris Matthews as saying he is not "an inside the Beltway guy." In the context of the interview, it appears that Bernie Sanders used the term to distinguish the American people from those who work on Capitol Hill.
