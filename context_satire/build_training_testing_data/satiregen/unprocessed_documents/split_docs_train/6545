 The slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi wrote passionately about ending the brutal war in Yemen. In one column for the Washington Post he called on Saudi Arabia to "use its clout and leverage within Western circles" to resolve the conflict. Never could he have imagined that he himself would become the leverage in attempts to end the war. US President Donald Trump seems reluctant to connect Mohammed bin Salman to the journalist's death, appearing to take little note of what sources say is a CIA assessment that the powerful Saudi Crown Prince ordered Khashoggi's killing.  The State Department said Saturday that the US government has not drawn a final conclusion about who is responsible for Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's brutal assassination. The department's statement came amid reports that the CIA has assessed that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman personally ordered the killing of Khashoggi. "There remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in the statement Saturday afternoon. "The State Department will continue to seek all relevant facts."  US Vice President Mike Pence has said Washington is "not going to stand for" the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, as Turkey suggested that the Saudi journalist's body was possibly carried out of Turkey in diplomatic bags. While in Papua New Guinea on a foreign trip, Pence said the US was "committed to ensuring that all of those responsible" for Khashoggi's death are held "accountable." "The murder of Jamal Khashoggi was an atrocity. It was also an affront to a free and independent press and the United States is determined to hold all of those accountable who are responsible for that murder."
