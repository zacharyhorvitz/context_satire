 A showdown is brewing between President Donald Trump and Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló -- and it is starting to get ugly. The President and the governor are at odds over the ongoing recovery efforts on the island in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017. In a CNN interview, the governor vented his frustration over not being able to get a meeting with Trump.  On Monday night, in a CNN town hall in Jackson, Mississippi, Sen. Elizabeth Warren made some news: She supports getting rid of the electoral college as the method by which we elect presidents. "My view is that every vote matters and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting and that means get rid of the Electoral College -- and every vote counts," the Massachusetts Democrat said, to raucous applause from the audience (The Democratic base is very much up in arms over the Electoral College, after Donald Trump won the White House in 2016 despite losing the popular vote by almost 2.9 million votes to Hillary Clinton). How realistic is what Warren is proposing? And how much -- really -- would it change how candidates campaign for the nation's top job?  Social media networks are facing a reckoning for their role in spreading far-right terrorist propaganda, after a deadly attack on a New Zealand mosque was live-streamed on Facebook. Recognizing that the gunman's gruesome stunt was designed to go viral, governments and business leaders have called on Facebook, Twitter and Google to do more to rid their platforms of hate speech that could encourage violence. Less than two weeks after the terror attack, Facebook announced that it would ban all "praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism" on its flagship platform and on Instagram. Most social platforms have taken aggressive action to tackle another extremist group in recent years: ISIS.
