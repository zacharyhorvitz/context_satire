 From student loan debt to rising health care costs, money continues to be the top source of stress for most Americans. Despite an improving economy, nearly 90% of Americans surveyed by the American Psychological Association said the level of stress they are feeling about money has either remained the same or gotten worse in the last year, according to the group's annual Stress in America report. Nearly three-quarters of the people surveyed said they had stressed about money at some point in the last month, while more than a quarter said they are stressed about money most or all of the time. People living in lower-income households, parents of children under 18, Millennials and Gen Xers were among those most likely to report high levels of money stress.
