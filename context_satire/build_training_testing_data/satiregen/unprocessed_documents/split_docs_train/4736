Kurt, in a voiceover, explains that it is not the circumstances of Finn's death that matter, but how he lived his life. Monteith's body was cremated in Vancouver on July 17, following a private viewing by his immediate family and girlfriend, Lea Michele. On July 25, Michele and Glee creator Ryan Murphy held a celebration of life for Monteith in Los Angeles, attended by cast, crew, and creators of the show, as well as colleagues from the show's network and studio. After consultation with Michele, who also plays Monteith's love interest on Glee, showrunners postponed production of Glee's fifth season to August rather than late July. Consequently, the season premiered a week later than planned.
