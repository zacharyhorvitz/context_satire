He and his wife had four rescue dogs, one of which, a bulldog named The Pig, he shares a bed with. Silverstone is noted for being an animal rights and environmental activist. She became a vegan in 1998 after attending an animal rights meeting, saying "I realized that I was the problem ... I was an animal lover who was eating animals." She has stated she struggled with childhood vegetarianism, stating "at eight years old it's hard to stick to your guns â€“ and so through the years I was always starting and stopping trying to be a vegetarian." Silverstone has two older siblings, a half-sister from her father's previous marriage, Kezi Silverstone; and a brother, David Silverstone. She married her longtime boyfriend, rock musician Christopher Jarecki, in a beachfront ceremony at Lake Tahoe on June 11, 2005. After meeting outside a movie theater in 1997, the couple dated for eight years prior to their marriage. They got engaged about a year before their marriage, and Jarecki presented Silverstone with an engagement ring that had belonged to his grandmother.
