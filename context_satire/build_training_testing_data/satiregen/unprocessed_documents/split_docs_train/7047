The ongoing spat with Home Depot finally came to a head in July 1995, when Rickel was sued by Home Depot in a New Jersey state court. At the time of the dispute, Home Depot was looking to build a large store on a plot of land situated on Orange Street in Bloomfield, New Jersey near the Watsessing train station and Exit 148 of the Garden State Parkway. Rickel once again cried foul, and this time it was due to what they perceived to be a large encroachment on their territory. From its opening in 1998 through 2015, the prison was operated by Corrections Corporation of America, and housed prisoners from California state. A year after its closure in 2015 the Oklahoma Department of Corrections announced plans to lease the physical facility from CCA to house inmates. Another addition to the prison, H Unit, houses inmates under both administrative and disciplinary segregation. H Unit is also the site of Oklahoma's death row and the state's lethal injection death chamber.
