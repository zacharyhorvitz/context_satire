On Thursday, 4 November 2010 Stryder attended the O2 Shepherds Bush Empire in England, for Alicia Keys' charity Keep a Child Alive charity ball and auction, along with other special guests. All proceeds from the auctions for the event were donated to Keep a Child Alive (KCA). Stryder donates income from Goji Electronics to charity. In Fall 2008, Keep a Child Alive launched a mobile donating campaign with Co-Founder and Global Ambassador Alicia Keys. Keys raised over $40,000 in micro-donations by asking concert goers to text ALIVE to 90999. The mobile giving campaign was created through a partnership between Keep a Child Alive, the Mobile Giving Foundation and Mgive. "Don't Give Up" was recorded by American recording artist Alicia Keys and Irish musician Bono. Retitled "Don't Give Up (Africa)", the song was produced by Keys and Steve Lillywhite. On 6 December 2005, the song was released as a single exclusively on iTunes and a ringtone version was released by Cingular Wireless. The proceeds of the release went to the charity Keep a Child Alive, for which Keys is a spokesperson.
