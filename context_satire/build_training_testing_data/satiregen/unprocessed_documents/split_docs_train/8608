This devotion is predominantly used in the Catholic Church, followed by the high-church Anglicans, Lutherans and Eastern Catholics. In the Catholic Church, the liturgical Solemnities of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus is celebrated the first Friday after the Solemnity of Corpus Christi, or 19 days after Pentecost Sunday. The Catholic Herz-Jesu-Kirche (Church of the Sacred Heart) is a Neo-Gothic hall church located in the  borough Mombach of the German city of Mainz. It is dedicated to the Sacred Heart. The church calendar of 1911 says: The name "Sacred Heart Church" originated from the idea to honour the memory of the great social bishop von Ketteler, who throughout his life was a pious and zealous admirer of the Sacred Heart, in his hundredth year of birth. One of Dayton's oldest Catholic parishes, St. Joseph's Church was established in 1846. The lack of space in that church prompted some of the members to leave in July 1883 and establish Sacred Heart Church; under the leadership of St. Joseph's associate pastor Hugh McDevitt, the congregation rented a meeting hall while waiting for the construction of their building. Land for the present church was purchased for $19,000, and William Henry Elder laid the cornerstone in June 1888. Exterior work was completed in the following year, and by 1893 construction was close enough to completion that the congregation could begin worshipping in their building.
