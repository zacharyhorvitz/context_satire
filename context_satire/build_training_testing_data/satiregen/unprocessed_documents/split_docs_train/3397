 Rosie O'Donnell has gone public with allegations her father sexually abused her. The actress told Variety, "It started very young." "And then when my mother died, it sort of ended in a weird way, because then he was with these five children to take care of," she said. "On the whole, it's not something I like to talk about." Harris came out as gay publicly in November 2006, saying, "I am happy to dispel any rumors or misconceptions and am quite proud to say that I am a very content gay man living my life to the fullest and feel most fortunate to be working with wonderful people in the business I love." Colleen looked like a warrior, so people assumed she was the earth mother. But in real life Colleen was not to be let out without a keeper. She couldn't stop herself from taking care of people, which she then did with more care than she took care of herself. Her generosity of spirit was overwhelming and her smile so dazzling that you couldn't pull the f_-kng reins in on her even if you desperately wanted to and knew damn well that somebody should.
