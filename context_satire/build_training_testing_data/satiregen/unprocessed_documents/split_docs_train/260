 A leading activist in the Black Lives Matter movement said he found himself unintentionally seated beside Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum at the first Sunday service following last week's Charleston Massacre. Deray McKesson, an influential activist with a large social media presence, attended the service at Mother Emanuel AME Church to support the grieving community and to encourage the South Carolina legislature to take down the Confederate Flag. Santorum, who like most Republicans has not advocated for the removal of the flag, was also in attendance. "It was random, honestly," McKesson told CNN in a phone interview Monday.  A day after thousands mourned the slayings of nine black worshippers at Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, leaders of diverse ages, races and backgrounds came together to say a symbol of segregation has no place at the state Capitol. Remove the Confederate flag that has flown at the state Capitol complex, they demanded. Put the relic of history where it belongs, in a museum. On Monday, three of the state's most prominent politicians -- Gov.  South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham blames 21-year-old Dylann Roof, the man who shot and killed nine African Americans praying in Charleston, for his actions, and the presidential hopeful doesn't want the Confederate flag to be used as an excuse. "We're not going to give this a guy an excuse about a book he might have read or a movie he watched or a song he listened to or a symbol out anywhere. It's him ... not the flag," the Republican senator told CNN's "New Day" Alisyn Camerota. One of the common photos of Roof circulated in the media is one of him seen posing by a car featuring a South Carolina license plate depicting the Confederate flag.
