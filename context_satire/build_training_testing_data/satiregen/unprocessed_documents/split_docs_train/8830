 As Hillary Clinton prepares to announce her vice presidential nominee as early as Friday, one man has emerged as the dark horse candidate: Tom Vilsack. A former governor of Iowa, Vilsack has been President Barack Obama's agriculture secretary since 2009. He wouldn't exactly add pizzazz and zip to the Democratic ticket, but for anyone who knows the Clintons intimately, it is no surprise that the 65-year-old has risen to the top of the running mate short list. In recent days, sources say Vilsack and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine have emerged the two leading contenders.  Hillary Clinton officially won the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday. Then, Bill Clinton took the Democratic National Convention on a 45-minute tour through the former first lady, senator and secretary of state's biography. "In the spring of 1971," he began, "I met a girl." Bill Clinton's case for Hillary Clinton as a "change-maker" headlined the convention's second day.  Hillary Clinton is poised to reveal her vice presidential candidate Friday in a message to supporters, people close to the search say, and is planning to make her first appearance with her running mate at a campaign rally in Miami on Saturday. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia has emerged as a leading contender after a methodical search, several Democrats close to the campaign say, receiving spirited backing from President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton. In selecting the battleground of Florida to make her public announcement, Clinton is hoping to seize the spotlight from Republicans after their convention in Cleveland. She is set to visit Orlando and Tampa on Friday, but her new partner is not expected to join her until Saturday at a rally here at Florida International University, where the student body is more than half Hispanic.
