 President Donald Trump thinks his involvement in the special counsel investigation "will be wrapped up pretty soon," according to Chris Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax and a longtime friend of the President. "When I speak to the President about this, he thinks there's nothing to it, that it -- that this investigation, in terms of his involvement, will be wrapped up pretty soon," Ruddy told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday. Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. Trump has denied any collusion.  Jared Kushner met earlier this month with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team as part of the investigation into Russia's meddling in the election, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Mueller's team specifically asked Kushner about former national security advisor Michael Flynn, who is under investigation by the special counsel, two sources said. Flynn was the dominant topic of the conversation, one of the sources said. "Mr. Kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so," Abbe Lowell, Kushner's lawyer, told CNN.  Rob Goldstone, the British publicist who arranged and attended the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, will testify before the House and Senate intelligence committees as early as next week, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The agreement for Goldstone to appear before the congressional Russia panels is the latest sign that the music publicist is ready to cooperate with the investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 US elections. Last month, Goldstone said he was ready to come to the United States to talk to special counsel Robert Mueller, though a date was not set. "I'm keen to talk to them and put my recollection of events in the public record," Goldstone said in an interview with The Sunday Times.
