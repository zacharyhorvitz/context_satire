Grandma featured briefly in the film, Thunderbird 6, but has no dialogue. She does not appear in the 2004 live action film at all, instead being replaced by a new character called Onaha, who was Kyrano's wife and Tin-Tin's mother. Grandma returned in the 2015 remake Thunderbirds Are Go, portrayed by Sandra Dickinson; in the new show, she was one of only three people to know of the Hood (the others being Jeff and Kayo). She has a noticeably different personality: she is noticeably tougher than her original counterpart, has taken over the role of head of the family following her sonâ€™s disappearance, and is a terrible cook. As the family matriarch, Grandma keeps her family together, offering wisdom and advice for them and the others in the household such as Tin-Tin. It is Grandma who is instrumental in keeping Alan and Tin-Tin together when one of Tin-Tin's old flames pays a visit ("End Of The Road"). Together with Kyrano and sometimes Tin-Tin, Grandma takes care of the domestic chores in the Tracy house, though she can sometimes be confused by all the technological gadgetry, getting tracking bugs mixed into her apple pie at one point ("Day Of Disaster"), though she is able to work a nuclear oven ("Give Or Take A Million"). Although not an active part of International Rescue, Grandma still plays a role when need be. She has been known to help her grandsons put together what equipment they need ("Sun Probe") and it is she who comes up with a solution for a rescue mission in the Bank of England when everyone else is stuck ("Vault Of Death"). She also attends filming of the Ned Cook Show episode in which he thanks International Rescue for saving him ("Terror In New York City"). Throughout her years, Grandma has never visited a stately home but hopes to do so, especially after meeting Lady Penelope ("The Mighty Atom").
