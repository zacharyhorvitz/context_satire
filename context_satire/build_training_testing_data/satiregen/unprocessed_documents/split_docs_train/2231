 The sprawling and soaked Houston metro area and other deluged towns in southeast Texas braced for devastating floods and pummeling rainfall on Sunday as Tropical Storm Harvey stalled over land and drenched dogged searchers and anxious residents. A flash flood emergency was in effect for parts of the Houston area. National Weather Service and local officials are advising Houston-area residents to avoid traveling. Three to 4 inches of rainfall were reported in the region in one hour's time.  Highways in Texas filled with cars Thursday into the night as coastal residents made their way north and out of the path of a hurricane that forecasters say will bring "life-threatening" amounts of rain. Some areas could get as many as 35 inches of rain from Hurricane Harvey and many will get more than a foot, forecasters from the National Hurricane Center said. Harvey has strengthened to a Category 2 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, according to the National Weather Service. As Harvey gained strength Thursday, residents along the Texas coast made the choice to evacuate or stay.  Bands of heavy rain from Hurricane Harvey began pummeling Houston early Saturday as the flood-prone city braced for what could be several days of downpours as the monster storm hovers over Texas. Harvey made landfall as a Category 4 storm late Friday between Port Aransas and Port O'Connor, Texas, about 150 miles southwest of Houston, the nation's fourth largest city with a metropolitan-area population of 5 million people. A flash-flood watch was in effect Saturday for the Houston area, according to the National Weather Service. More than a foot of rain could fall in the city over the next five days, with higher tallies possible in localized areas, CNN meteorologists said.
