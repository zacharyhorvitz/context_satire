 ISIS has lost its final stronghold in Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces announced Saturday, bringing an end to the so-called caliphate declared by the terrorist group in 2014. The coalition of Kurdish and Arab soldiers backed by US, British and French special forces said it defeated ISIS and fully liberated Baghouz in eastern Syria. "Syrian Democratic Forces declare total elimination of so-called caliphate and 100% territorial defeat of ISIS. On this unique day, we commemorate thousands of martyrs whose efforts made the victory possible,"  tweeted Mustafa Bali, head of  the SDF press office.  US-backed forces in Syria have captured a handful of ISIS fighters linked to the January suicide attack in Manbij, Syria, that killed four Americans, according to a US defense official. A spokesman for the SDF, Mustafa Bali, confirmed the capture in a tweet, writing that it occurred "following technical surveillance by our forces." The US defense official said up to five ISIS members who were involved in the planning and execution of the attack are being detained by the Syrian Democratic Forces. The US has also questioned the militants, who were captured in Manbij.  ISIS has suffered a momentous blow with the defeat of its last physical stronghold, according to an announcement Saturday by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. At the height of its power four years ago, ISIS controlled an area in Iraq and Syria that was the size of Portugal and lorded over almost 8 million people -- a population larger than that of Bulgaria. ISIS also ran a quasi-state that taxed and extorted its millions of subjects, enabling it to field a terrorist army with a large war chest. While ISIS once attracted an estimated 40,000 people around the world to join its so-called caliphate,  that number has since plummeted, as it seems no one wants to join the losing team.
