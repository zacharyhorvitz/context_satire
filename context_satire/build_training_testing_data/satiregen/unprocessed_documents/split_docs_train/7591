On 3 October 2018, Sky Sports confirmed that Parker would return to New Zealand for his next bout in December, with the fight taking place in Christchurch. The fight would be Parker's first in his home country in over 18 months. Parker's opponent was later announced to be American boxer Alexander Flores (17-1-1, 15 KOs), whose sole loss was to former IBF world champion Charles Martin in 2014. Speaking of the fight, Parker said, "For me, boxing is all about the challenge - and this is another big one. In his next bout he defeated 39-year-old defending American WBO Oriental heavyweight champion Brian Minto on 5 July 2014 in Auckland, New Zealand. Parker knocked Minto down in the fifth round and then opened his arms. After rocking him again in the seventh Minto did not return as his corner threw in the towel, leaving Joseph winning his third title. Having been knocked down twice, Minto knew at the end of the seventh round he had no chance of winning. Standing together, speaking to Sky Sports after the fight, Whyte gave Parker credit, "He was slick and I knew he was going to fight for the first few rounds, then come back in the final few rounds. I am annoyed I slipped at the final hurdle in the last round. I was rocked and took a few." Whyte stated he would take another fight before the end of 2018 and ready for Anthony Joshua in April 2019, "I would like to fight Joshua again if he wants it.
