It is Derek's 50th birthday. Dougie says that he is a decade younger. Derek celebrates with a party at Broad Hill, specifying the music and food that he wants. Dougie takes Kev and some of the residents in a minibus to the local library. Gervais plays 50-year-old Derek Noakes, a care worker at Broad Hill, a home for the elderly, who has worked there for three years. He likes watching reality television shows and game shows and is interested in celebrities, YouTube and, above all, talking about animals. The viewer is told he is kind, helpful and selfless, with good intentions. He is vulnerable because of his childlike naivety and distractions from society. Ingram Hill was ordained in 1935 and became curate at Buckland-in-Dover. This facilitated his developing interest in the cathedrals and abbeys of northern France, which he explored each summer, as usual by bicycle. However, he also built a growing reputation for his parish work, moving to a further curacy at St Andrewâ€™s, Croydon, in 1939, and later taking over as priest-in-charge and then vicar at Holy Innocents, South Norwood. This was at a time of constant danger during the London Blitz, but he made a great success of Holy Innocents, where he ministered for 14 years.
