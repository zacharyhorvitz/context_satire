Brian was born in Lakewood, New Jersey and was raised in Havana, Florida. He is the youngest son of three, spending his first few years at the Jersey Shore, and then most of his childhood in the northern Florida panhandle. He was raised on a diet of 90's alt-rock and 70's folk music. His grandmother played piano, sitting in at local clubs whilst his mother dabbled in songwriting and theatre. After high school, Brian initially played throughout Florida, New Jersey and New York in local bands. He took some time to travel the country playing music, ultimately landing back in New York where he came to realise writing his own solo material would help him master his craft and grow as an artist. His brother, John Mackey, also shared in these victories while his father, "Tyler" Mackey was a one-time All-Ireland runner-up with Limerick.
