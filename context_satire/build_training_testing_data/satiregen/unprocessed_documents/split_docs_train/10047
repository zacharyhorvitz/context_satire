 Two weeks before she was fired, Kirstjen Nielsen told President Donald Trump "no." Nielsen, at the time the head of the Department of Homeland Security, resisted Trump's order to close the US border with Mexico in El Paso; by telling Trump the move would be "a bad and even dangerous idea, and that the governor of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, has been very supportive of the President," reported CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday. Trump eventually scrapped the idea -- although he floated the idea of closing the entire US-Mexico border via Twitter soon after. Eventually he gave up on that idea as well.  The abrupt resignation of Department of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen ends a tumultuous two-ish year tenure in the job in which one simple fact just kept popping up: No one on earth could do this job to the satisfaction of President Donald Trump. The reporting coming out of Nielsen's resignation speaks to the impossibility of the DHS job under Trump. There's this from CNN: "Trump was furious with Nielsen , telling her he didn't think she was doing enough to secure the border. But Nielsen stood her ground, citing the law in certain instances, the source said.  Sooner or later, many of the President's subordinates face the same dilemma. They can respect the law or they can work for Donald Trump. It's often just not possible to do both. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen became the latest Cabinet member to pay the price for not letting Trump do what he wants -- and on the issue he cares about more than any other -- when she was forced to resign on Sunday.
