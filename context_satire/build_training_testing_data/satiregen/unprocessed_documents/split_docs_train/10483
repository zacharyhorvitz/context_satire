Joint sessions of the United States Congress occur on special occasions that require a concurrent resolution from both House and Senate. These sessions include counting electoral votes after a presidential election and the president's State of the Union address. The constitutionally mandated report, normally given as an annual speech, is modeled on Britain's Speech from the Throne, was written by most presidents after Jefferson but personally delivered as a spoken oration beginning with Wilson in 1913. Joint Sessions and Joint Meetings are traditionally presided over by the speaker of the House, except when counting presidential electoral votes when the vice president (acting as the president of the Senate) presides.  Conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham pressed Vice President Mike Pence in an interview Wednesday on how the Trump administration would pay for all its proposed initiatives without adding to the federal deficit. Ingraham, a Donald Trump supporter whose name was once floated as a potential candidate for White House press secretary, went as far as to ask Pence if he was no longer a hawk on the deficit as he had been during his tenure in Congress. The exchange came after Trump outlined his priorities in a speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. In the speech, Trump proposed a massive increase in military spending and asked Congress for $1 trillion investment in infrastructure.  President Donald Trump is set to give an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday -- but it technically won't be his first State of the Union address. Trump isn't shaking up any traditions -- as he is known to do -- but instead following what past presidents have done before him. His speech will be known as an "address to a joint session." Traditionally, a president of the United States should be in office for a year before they give their first State of the Union address.
