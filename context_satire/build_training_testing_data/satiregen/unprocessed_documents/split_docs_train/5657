When Apatow was twelve years old, his parents divorced. Robert went to live with his maternal grandparents, and Mia went to live with her mother. As a child, Apatow lived mainly with his father, and visited his mother on weekends. Apatow's mother spent a summer working at a comedy club, which is where Judd was first exposed to live stand-up comedy. Before Hollywood, Judd spent his early years growing up on Air Force bases in Angeles City  in the Philippines and Hawaii. His mother, Violeta (n√©e Calventos) is Filipina, and his father, Larry Judd, is Portuguese. The Air Force then moved his family to Niceville, Florida, where he attended Niceville High School. While in Florida, Judd, an avid athlete, spent a lot of time surfing and golfing. Judd met Jennifer Lopez in Spain in late 2000 when he was hired to direct her music video for "Love Don't Cost a Thing". He composed the song, "Alive", which was selected as the theme song for the movie Enough. The two married on September 29, 2001. The marriage ended less than a year later.
