 If this was the final game of Peyton Manning's 18-year career, he couldn't have scripted the ending much better. A 2-yard rushing touchdown from running back C.J. Anderson -- in addition to a defensive score and three field goals from kicker Brandon McManus -- gave the Denver Broncos a 24-10 win over the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50 in front of 71,088 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, who had two strip-sack fumbles of Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, was named Super Bowl Most Valuable Player.  We've seen a story like this before.

He was sacked five times and failed to throw a touchdown pass during a contest watched by an estimated 160 million people across the world.
