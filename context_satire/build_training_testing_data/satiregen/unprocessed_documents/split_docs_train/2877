In March 2013, Lambert wrote an article for Out magazine's tribute to David Bowie, who was about to release a new album. In it, he explained how Bowie helped inform the expression of his own sexuality and gender in his work: "A light bulb went off—I wasn't into drag, I didn't want to dress like a woman, but I wanted to express my gender and artistic identity differently than the mainstream. Bowie was a key inspiration. It was about the androgyny of mixing it up, and that was what was so incredible about his concepts—he was one of the first rock stars to really push the idea that sexuality was not black and white but an exploration". Back in their apartment, after having killed the couple, they tried to remove all the traces that would ever prove they have been there. Stanton told him that they could take a break, but Reese said that he was fine. So Stanton drew out a gun on him and wanted him to choose between being a boy scout or a killer because she was tired of working with both. She also reminded him that he chose this life. While holding him captive, Root explained to Finch that she does not want to control the Machine but to "set it free" to usher in a posthuman future. Several months later, Root, to gain information, began working, as "Miss May", an assistant to the Special Counsel at the Office of Special Counsel.
