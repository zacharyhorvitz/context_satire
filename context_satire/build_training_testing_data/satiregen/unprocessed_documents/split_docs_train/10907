In October 2017, a piece on transgender issues by Humphrys was criticised for misgendering and trivialising trans experiences, first by claiming that transgender women are "men who think they are women". Humphrys went on to say, "In other words, if a man thinks he's a woman, all he has to do is fill in a form and say so, he doesn't need to convince anybody else." When talking to Bex Stinson, a transgender woman from the LGBT charity Stonewall , Humphrys asked whether she had "anything to prove that" she was a woman. Stinson referred to her driving licence and passport as well as "life experience" as "my fundamental proof" of womanhood. In December 2013 Humphrys was featured in an episode of the BBC Wales series Coming Home, together with his older brother Graham. It was revealed that their great-grandmother Sarah Willey was, from the age of six, resident at the Cardiff workhouse and that their paternal great-grandfather was from Finland. In 2016, when interviewing Labour MP Angela Eagle (who cried after leaving the shadow cabinet), Humphrys asked: "Do we want somebody who weeps in the face of this sort of thing confronting Putin, for instance? ", later adding "Shouldn't you be able to control those emotions when you're under great stress?". Eagle replied that "being in touch with your emotions is quite an important thing", but Humphrys continued to criticise her." Responding to this line of questioning, Emma Kennedy tweeted "will John Humphrys tackle Obama on his occasional crying during office?
