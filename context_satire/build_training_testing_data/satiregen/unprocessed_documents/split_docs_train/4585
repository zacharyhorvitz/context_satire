The Brooklyn Nets are an American professional basketball team based in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.

They are one of two NBA teams located in New York City; the other is the New York Knicks.  In an unexpected victory for the workers' union, a bankruptcy judge rejected American Airlines' request to throw out its pilots contract and impose concessions on its 8,000 pilots. The latest development could make it more difficult for the airline to  emerge from bankruptcy as an independent carrier. American and its holding company AMR are seeking to cut more than $1 billion in annual costs through changes in its labor contracts, including  deep staff cuts, but it needs approval of either its unions or the bankruptcy court to do so. The Transport Workers Union, which represents its ground workers, ratified a concession contract last week. The meaning of the word American in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. American is derived from America, a term originally denoting all of the New World (also called the Americas). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the United States of America. In modern English, American generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification.
