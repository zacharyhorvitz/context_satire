WWF-Canada (also known as World Wildlife Fund Canada) is one of Canada's largest conservation organizations and is a member of the WWF global network, actively contributing to the protection, management, and restoration of the environment. Its name remains World Wildlife Fund in Canada and the United States, but is known as World Wide Fund for Nature around the world.  Thick, black graffiti sprayed onto a Russian polar bear's coat poses an extra threat to an animal already in danger, experts say. Video shared on social media shows a lumbering polar bear whose back had been branded with "T-34," the name of an old Soviet Union tank. The video was posted to Facebook on December 1 by Sergey Kavry, a World Wildlife Fund employee who lives in the remote Russian region. In the comments, Kavry said he obtained the video via WhatsApp from indigenous minorities in Chukotka, in Russia's far east, though it is not clear from the video where it was filmed. The idea for a fund on behalf of endangered animals was officially proposed by Victor Stolan to Sir Julian Huxley in response to articles he published in the British newspaper The Observer. This proposal led Huxley to put Stolan in contact with Max Nicholson, a person who had had thirty years experience of linking progressive intellectuals with big business interests through the Political and Economic Planning think tank. Nicholson thought up the name of the organization. WWF was conceived on 29 April 1961, under the name of World Wildlife Fund, and its first office was opened on 11 September that same year in Morges, Switzerland.
