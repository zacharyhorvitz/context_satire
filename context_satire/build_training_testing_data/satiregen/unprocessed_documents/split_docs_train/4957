Kent Heitholt was found beaten and strangled shortly after 2 am on November 1, 2001, in the parking lot of the Columbia Daily Tribune, where he worked as a sports editor. Heitholt's murder went unsolved for two years until police received a tip about a man named Charles Erickson. Erickson could not remember the evening of the murder and was concerned that he may have been involved with the murder. Erickson, who spent that evening partying with Ferguson, was interrogated by police. On September 11, Dugan was visibly emotional at a press conference where he claimed no matter how hard he has tried to change public perception of himself, his good acts go unnoticed. Dugan went on to say “I have been an easy target since 2013... when I got sacked from Canberra, everyone has had an opinion of me since then and it’s never going to change, I raised $15,000 for a young boy recently, visited him in hospital, he passed away, you didn’t hear about that". On the night of the murder, Erickson had been under the influence of cocaine, Adderall, and alcohol. The following day, he had no memory of what had transpired that Halloween night. At a later hearing, attorneys asked Erickson if he had noticed anything unusual the morning following the crime such as injuries or blood on his clothing. Erickson confirmed that there was nothing out of the ordinary.
