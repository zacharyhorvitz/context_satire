 How much longer will the 737 Max be grounded? No one really knows. Boeing insists it is making progress on getting its fix for the troubled jet approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration, which it needs to put the Max back in the air. But the company has stopped giving any public estimates about when that approval might come. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg has stated that there was "no surprise, or gap, or unknown here or something that somehow slipped through a certification process." On April 29, 2019 he stated the design of the aircraft was not flawed and reiterated that it was designed per Boeing's standards. In a May 29 interview with CBS, Boeing admitted that it had botched the software implementation and lamented the poor communications.  Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Sunday he was "disappointed" the company was not more forthcoming with regulators about a problem with a safety feature on its troubled 737 Max airplanes, according to a published report. Speaking at the Paris Air Show, Muilenberg said Boein will be more transparent going forward, the Wall Street Journal reported. The 737 Max was grounded worldwide after a fatal crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet in March, which followed a fatal crash of a Lion Air jet in Indonesia in October. Crash investigators have focused on an automatic safety feature on the jet as a contributor to the crashes.
