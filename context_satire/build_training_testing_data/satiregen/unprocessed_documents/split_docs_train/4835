 Hillary Clinton said Thursday that the United States needs to confront "systemic racism" in its law enforcement efforts â€” declaring again that "black lives matter." The Democratic presidential front-runner's comments during a Thursday morning campaign event are her latest effort -- just days after making the same comment in a Facebook chat -- to embrace the outrage over African-Americans' deaths in police custody and in racially-motivated shootings. "I think we first have to acknowledge and believe that black lives matter. This is not just a slogan, this should be a guiding principle," Clinton told the crowd of 400 at the Brookland Baptist Church in West Columbia.  Andre Anderson says his main task will be to restore trust between Ferguson's predominantly black populace and the Missouri city's mostly white police force. Anderson, the city's first African-American head of police, believes he's the right man for the job. Ferguson officials on Wednesday introduced Anderson as the city's latest interim police chief. He will take at least a six-month leave of absence from his commander post with police in Glendale, Arizona, to tackle a department put in the national spotlight by last August's shooting of teenager Michael Brown.
