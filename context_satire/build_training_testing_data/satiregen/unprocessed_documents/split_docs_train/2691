In September 2014, Nelson said the U.S. should hit back at ISIS immediately because "the U.S. is the only one that can put together a coalition to stop this group that's intent on barbaric cruelty." He was hired by English new wave artist Gary Numan to produce his 1983 album Warriors, with Numan claiming that Bill Nelson was his "favourite guitar player, bar none." However, the two musicians failed to maintain a working relationship, and ultimately Nelson chose not to be credited for his production role on the album. Nelson also contributed towards several tracks on David Sylvian's Gone to Earth (1986).  Bill Clinton is not possibly planning a presidential run, as his wife may be doing, and he's not about to have a baby, as his daughter is, but for the last three days in New York City, the former president has been the focal point of the Clinton orbit. While the Clinton Global Initiative features the labors of all three Clintons, the 2014 conference -- which came at a time when the former president is somewhat the third string of his own family -- made clear that Bill Clinton is still the charity's chief campaigner and star attraction, and he's not about to let his "baby" go. The former president's closing remarks -- which had Hillary Clinton, Chelsea Clinton and an audience full of celebrities, thought leaders and big-money donors wrapped around his finger -- made this clear. The president-turned-philanthropist-in-chief detailed to a rapt audience Wednesday night why his 10-year old endeavor continues to matter.
