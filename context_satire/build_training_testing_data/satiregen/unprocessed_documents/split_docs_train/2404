Years later, Olivia returned into Hal's life as a representative for the new Green Lantern toyline and they renewed their romance. During this time, the Lenglyns and the Weaponers of Qward attempted to control the Ergono power by abducting Olivia and Aleea Strange (daughter of Adam Strange) (whom they realized had the U-Mind power). A band of Qward soldiers captured Olivia again, hoping that her presence would help them oppose the Weaponers. This time, the power of the Ergono usurped her. Qward was ruled by their universe's version of the Monitor (who would come to be called the Anti-Monitor by Earth's superheroes). It was this entity that created the organization of warriors known as the Weaponers of Qward within the race known as Qwardians. The Qwardians are the anti-matter counterparts to the Guardians of the Universe. Although the Anti-Monitor was defeated and imprisoned by his counterpart from the positive-matter universe, the Weaponers themselves continued to rule their world. Olivia Reynolds is a fictional character in the DC Comics universe. She has a latent superpower (the U-Mind), and has been abducted by various races who wanted to harness the power, and temporarily became a villainess. All memories of her experiences with the U-Mind have now been blocked after she was mindwiped.
