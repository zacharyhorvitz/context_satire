In "A Closer Eye", she turns away every paramedic that she was partnered with, believing that Dawson will come back. She was then partnered with Emily Foster by Chief Boden, who told her to make it work. At first, the chemistry between the two was a little rocky. In "Going to War", she confronts Casey about letting Dawson leave. In season 7, she dates Kyle Sheffield, a chaplain with the CFD and friend of Foster. They break up in "Fault in Him", with Kyle citing that their relationship has led to firefighters not willing to confide in him, after Brett asks him to talk to Casey about a bad call he experienced. She has a hard time moving on from him and sympathizes with Matt Casey on the subject of tough break-ups. She then attempts to help him out by setting him up with her spin class instructor, Olivia, in "Try Like Hell". She came from a dysfunctional family; her parents divorced not long after marrying and her mother became a heroin addict and eventually abandoned the family. Her sister Alissa lives in Kansas City and they lost contact. Prior to being cast on Chicago Fire, Madison actually appeared as Alissa on Chicago P.D. in the episode "Call It Macaroni".
