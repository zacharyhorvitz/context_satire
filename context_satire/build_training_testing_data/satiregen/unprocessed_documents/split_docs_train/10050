 Airlines and airports in the Northeast started making tentative steps toward normalcy on Wednesday in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, though LaGuardia Airport in New York City remained stubbornly under water. "LaGuardia is still closed and will be for the day," said Allison Steinberg, spokeswoman for JetBlue, which canceled about 1,500 flights because of the storm that hammered the Northeast on Monday. JetBlue personnel have posted various photos of the deluged LaGuardia on the company's BlueTales blog. Because of these infrastructure problems, LaGuardia isn't expected to open until at least Thursday, said Steinberg.  Silicon Valley is the national technology hub, but New York gets its share of tech events -- and many of this week's were canceled in anticipation of Hurricane Sandy pounding the East Coast. New York City has declared a state of emergency, and public transportation was suspended starting at 7 p.m. Sunday. Flooding and power outages throughout the city are a concern. Google was the first to spike its New York event, a mobile announcement planned for Monday morning. Broadway Junction is a New York City Subway station complex shared by the elevated BMT Canarsie Line and BMT Jamaica Line, and the underground IND Fulton Street Line. It was also served by trains of the Fulton Street Elevated until that line closed in 1956. It is located roughly at the intersection of Broadway, Fulton Street and Van Sinderen Avenue at the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant and East New York, Brooklyn. The complex is served by the A, J, and L trains at all times; the C train at all times except late nights; and the Z train during rush hours in the peak direction only.
