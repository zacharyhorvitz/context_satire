Base Hologram and the Estate of Whitney E. Houston announced that the production will reunite audiences with Houston, using state of the art holographic technology to create a live theatrical concert. The show will be creatively directed and choreographed by Fatima Robinson, and will feature dancers, singers and a live band. The show is set to feature Houston's most iconic hits, including "I Will Always Love You", "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)", and the 2019 Kygo produced single, a cover of Steve Winwood's "Higher Love". The accompanying music video for "How Will I Know" features scenes of Houston dancing in a setting of video screens and colored partitions. The music video gave Houston exposure to the teens and MTV. It also received nominations at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards in the categories of Best Female Video and Best New Artist, winning the former category. The song was performed on many of her tours including Greatest Love Tour (1986) and her Nothing but Love World Tour (2009â€“10). In 1985, "How Will I Know" was released as the third single officially. With its colorful and energetic video, the song brought the singer to the teens and MTV, which black artists have traditionally found tough to crack. It became another number one single for Houston, topping the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart and Hot Black Singles chart respectively. The final single, "Greatest Love of All", is a cover of "The Greatest Love of All", originally recorded in 1977 by George Benson and would become the biggest hit off the album with a three-week stay atop the Hot 100.
