When Baywatch executive producer David Hasselhoff offered the role of lifeguard C. J. Parker to Pamela Anderson, Anderson was immediately attracted to the role because of the "New Age thinking" that she shared with the character, including an interest in crystals, meditation, and dream interpretation. In the Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding reunion movie, C. J. reveals her biggest interest is in meditation. Anderson became the center of controversy when she posed in a bikini nearly nude for a PETA ad that was banned in Montreal, Quebec, on grounds that the ad was sexist. Anderson retorted saying, "In a city that is known for its exotic dancing and for being progressive and edgy, how sad that a woman would be banned from using her own body in a political protest over the suffering of cows and chickens. In some parts of the world, women are forced to cover their whole bodies with burqas â€“ is that next? I didn't think that Canada would be so puritanical."
