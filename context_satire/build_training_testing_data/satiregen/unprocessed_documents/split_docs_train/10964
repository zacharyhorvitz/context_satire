 A U.S. Marine Corps reservist, who had hoped to be free after Wednesday's hearing in a Mexican court, was sent back to prison where he's been held the last three months on weapons charges. Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi's next day in court is August 4. He's been imprisoned since March 31 when he drove into Mexico with three firearms in his truck.  Six weeks after he was released from Taliban captivity, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl spent his first day of regular duty working at the headquarters of U.S. Army North in Texas, the army said Tuesday. Bergdahl, like many soldiers at a new assignment, spent much of his day on Monday getting paperwork straightened out, spokesman Don Manuszewski said. The 28-year-old soldier spent five years in the hands of Taliban militants after he disappeared in Afghanistan in June 2009.  For five years, Taliban militants held Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl captive. They released images of him from time to time. In one piece of footage, he appeared gaunt, eating slowly.
