Bush relaunched her fashion label on September 11, 2008, under the name "Lauren Pierce". About her decision to use her middle name, Pierce, as opposed to her last name for the title of her line, Bush stated in November 2008 that it "wasn't a conscious decision." Further pressed, Bush said, "Obviously my last name is associated with politics. But Pierce is my grandmother's maiden name and my younger brother's name. Pierce served as a communications intern on the Howard Stern Show on May 7, 2008. He stated he would like to pursue a career in broadcasting after his NFL career. Near the end of the day's show he asked to stay for the remainder of the week and Howard agreed. Pierce calls Israel to meet a new client arrested for murder, who turns out to be Johnson. Meeting Israel in jail, Johnson accuses him of divulging privileged communications to collect the reward money, and resolves to torment Israel with the threat of jail time or death. Israel suffers a breakdown in which he becomes a law unto himself becoming both the lawyer and the defendant in one. After judging his own actions as unlawful as the defendant, he renounces his greedy, self-centered worldview.
