On March 11, 2014, JoS. A. Bank and Men's Wearhouse announced that both boards of directors had agreed to merge, with Men's Wearhouse acquiring JoS. A. Men's Wearhouse notably ran television and radio commercials featuring Zimmer, and the oft-repeated slogan, "You're going to like the way you look; I guarantee it." According to Business Week, Men's Wearhouse targets the common man, with "the neatly displayed clothes in Zimmer's stores  designed to cater to the unpretentious guy who wants to do as little as possible to maintain his wardrobe." Although brands, JoS. A Bank and Men's Wearhouse, cater to similar audiences, they go by it differently. JAB features only its own collections by sourcing textiles worldwide and fabricating suits only for its own retail locations. Because of the process by which they compose their dress pants and jackets, most of them can be altered.
