Katie  covered news and topics "that people care about". It was essentially a lifestyle show, but with news components to reflect Couricâ€™s background and interests. During an interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 2011, Couric said that she expected the show to cover various issues and be a mixture of The Oprah Winfrey Show and Today. On October 7, 2005, as part of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Couric broadcast her own mammogram on the Today show, in the hopes of recreating the "Couric Effect" around the issue of breast cancer. Ziegler has called the awarding of the Walter Cronkite award to Couric an "outrage." "What really happened here is that Katie Couric showed Governor Palin that she had an agenda on the abortion issue," Ziegler said.
