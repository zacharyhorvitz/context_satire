The trading house in Amsterdam wrote a bill for the amount for which it bought goods from a Swedish seller. The seller could then obtain money by selling the bill to someone who wanted to buy goods, in Amsterdam or elsewhere, and use the bill to pay for them. Importers and exporters both bought bills, in order to pay and in order to obtain money. Bills that were not cashed immediately earned interest. The Lövåsen lead and silver factory in Stora Skedvi was one of the first factories to be connected with the Grill family. The Swedish government handed over the administration of the factory to Anthoni Grill (I) in 1656, to be used as a laboratory and workshop by him. He had claimed that he was in possession of a secret "matter" that would enable him to extract much more copper, lead, silver and gold from the ore than by other conventional methods. He experimented fore some years at the laboratory, but he never improved the extraction process, and was consequently demoted from his position at the mine. All the noted Grills were in some way connected to the main Grill Trading House and to each other. Some Grills married a relative, others helped their nephews into business. In this way the Grill name was kept and passed on through the generations.
