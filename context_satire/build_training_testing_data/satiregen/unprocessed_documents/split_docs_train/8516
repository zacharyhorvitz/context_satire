Joe Heffley is Frank's brother and Greg's uncle. Frank has a sibling rivalry with Joe due to his actions. When Manny started potty training, Uncle Joe told him to watch out for the "potty monster", causing him to fear using the bathroom, forcing Frank to change his diapers for a longer time. Uncle Joe's children call their uncle "Aunt Fwank", which Frank swears he told them to do on purpose. Garrison "Gary" Heffley is Greg's uncle and has been married four times. In The Ugly Truth it is revealed that all of his wives divorced him as soon as they found out about his financial situation and job. In The Third Wheel he comes to live with Greg's family after he discovers his job selling shirts in Boston was a ripoff. Later in the book he is chosen to be the DJ at Greg's Valentine's Day dance. Uncle Larry is supposedly Greg's uncle. Greg is not sure if he is an actual relative, and he thinks someone invited him to a family gathering at some point and that he has been coming ever since. When Audra's fortune teller told her Meemaw's ring was in a photo album, Larry helped realize that the ring was in a plastic egg. This was proved to be true, as it was found in a plastic egg by Greg later on.
