 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said Friday that Chinese leaders should be taken "to the woodshed," not the White House, and argued that his support for China as governor was not at odds with a new, hardline stance he's taken while running for president. Earlier this week, Walker called on President Barack Obama to cancel a state dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping because of allegations of cyberattacks and militarization of the South China Sea. But as governor, he lobbied to meet personally with Xi in 2013 and appeared on China's state-run television in 2012.  It's not just the southern border: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says it's "legitimate" to discuss building a wall separating the United States from Canada, as well. The Republican presidential contender said the idea of a northern border has come up while he has campaigned in New Hampshire. In an interview for NBC's "Meet the Press" available online, Walker said his tough talk to securing the borders and enforcing U.S. laws extends to the 5,525-mile Canadian border as well.  Facing ridicule from members of his own party, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is backing down from his comments that building a wall along the U.S. northern border is a topic for "legitimate" discussion. "I never talked about a wall of the north, I'm certainly not now. That's just what happens when things get run amok," Walker told Fox News on Tuesday morning.
