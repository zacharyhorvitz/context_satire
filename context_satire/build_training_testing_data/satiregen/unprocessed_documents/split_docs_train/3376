Two weeks before the March 12 primary, an internal poll showed Romney losing to Nixon by a six-to-one margin in New Hampshire. Rockefeller, seeing the poll result as well, publicly maintained his support for Romney but said he would be available for a draft; the statement made national headlines and embittered Romney (who would later claim it was Rockefeller's entry, and not the "brainwashing" remark, that doomed him). Seeing his cause was hopeless, Romney announced his withdrawal as a presidential candidate on February 28, 1968. Romney wrote his son Mitt, still away on missionary work: "Your mother and I are not personally distressed. In his speech, Romney frequently invoked his father, former Michigan Governor George W. Romney (whose own presidential campaign had come undone forty years earlier), and the stage included a Nash Rambler, the car his father had made famous as an automobile executive. Romney stressed the variety of his own experiences that brought him to this point: While he was attending Stanford University for a year and then was away starting a ​2 1⁄2-year missionary stint in France, she decided on her own to convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during 1966. In doing so she accepted the guidance of Mitt's father George Romney, the Governor of Michigan. George included her in Romney family events while Mitt was away; she appreciated his treating her as an equal and picked him to baptize her.
