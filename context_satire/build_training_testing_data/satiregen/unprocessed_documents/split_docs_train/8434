Ten years later, eighteen-year-old Oscar is close to graduating and is in the process of applying to a special effects make-up school in New York City. He gets a job at a hardware store in hopes of spending less time with his father, who is casually childish and homophobic. At work, Oscar is drawn to a new employee, the confident and charismatic Wilder, but a sharp pain in Oscar's stomach warns him away. At home, Buffy tells Oscar that he seems happier and suggests that he is in love, a notion he quickly dismisses. When Oscar wakes, Wilder is gone. Not wanting to see his father, he goes to his mother's house and confronts her for abandoning him in the divorce. She comforts him and suggests that he come live with her. Realizing that he has left Buffy at his father's, Oscar hurries back to retrieve her. Oscar and Wilder's friendship develops as Oscar's interactions with his father get increasingly strained. Wilder is fired from the hardware store and decides to move away, inviting Oscar to a goodbye costume party. Returning home to prepare for the party, Oscar finds out that he has been rejected from the make-up school, the only one to which he applied. His father discovers him trying on some of his mother's clothes and the two have a heated argument.
