 It was the most-watched TV show in the world -- and it was a sexist mess. That's what Chinese activists are saying in a petition issued this week that calls for the cancellation of China's annual Lunar New Year Gala, a state TV extravaganza viewed last Wednesday by 690 million people -- but filled with grating skits mocking women and other minority groups. One sketch depicted an overweight woman in her late-20s complaining about being unmarried. The punchline?  Western companies are starting to freak out about moves by China that could prevent them supplying the country's financial industry with technology. Six groups representing European companies and banks have appealed for official help this week. They say China is breaking international trade rules. That comes as Beijing is reported to be removing some of the world's top tech brands from a list of approved central government suppliers.  "Go back home!" "Locusts! You're not welcome here!" These were just some of the insults hurled at Chinese shoppers Sunday as hundreds of Hong Kongers surged through through the old neighborhood of Yuen Long, an area close to the city's border with China.
