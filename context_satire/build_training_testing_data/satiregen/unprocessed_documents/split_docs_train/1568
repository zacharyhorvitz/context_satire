For much of his final two decades, Romney had been out of the political eye, but he re-emerged to the general public when he campaigned for his son, Mitt Romney, during the younger Romney's bid to unseat Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the 1994 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. Romney had urged Mitt to enter the race and moved into his son's house for its duration, serving as an unofficial advisor. Romney was a vigorous surrogate for his son in public appearances and at fundraising events.

As the presidential candidates head into their final day of campaigning, both President Obama and Mitt Romney are focusing on the biggest prizes: the elusive swing states. CNN currently lists Pennsylvania as likely to "lean Obama," but both campaigns are fighting for the Keystone state. Just one day after Mitt Romney took the stage in Pennsylvania, President Obama is deploying Bill Clinton to the state for four campaign states. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), who campaigned with both Romney and Paul Ryan this weekend, weighs in on the final push for his state on "Starting Point" today.  As President Barack Obama and former Gov. Mitt Romney crisscrossed the country during the final week of the 2012 presidential campaign, few people were able to see the candidates in their most candid and unguarded moments, except for their personal photographers. Several weeks ago, CNN invited each campaign team to submit images from the last week of the race, from Friday, Oct. 26 through Saturday, Nov. 3. Little did anyone know that the last week would be dominated not by last-minute stops in swing states and wall-to-wall speeches to rally the party faithful, but rather one story: Superstorm Sandy.
