On July 1, 2009, Taco Bell replaced 20-year sponsor McDonald's as the fast-food partner of the NBA. Taco Bell and the NBA agreed on a 4-year deal allowing them to advertise on ABC, TNT and ESPN, and NBA-themed promotions. On July 21, 2009, Gidget, the Chihuahua featured in Taco Bell ads in the late 1990s, was euthanized after suffering a stroke. She was 15 years old. Ryckert met Mondo in 2015 during his time in San Francisco, with Mondo living in her native New Jersey, initially having a long-distance relationship, before moving together to New York. Ryckert describes Taco Bell as being one of the first conversations they had and that he "knew then that  were going to be a good fit.". Mondo describes her life since being in a relationship with Ryckert as "so strange and exciting," and immediately agreed to entering the competition. The ceremony took place on June 25, 2017, with Taco Bell paying for the $600 wedding package. In 2017, media outlets reported that Ryckert married Bianca Mondo after winning a Taco Bell competition, the Love and Tacos contest, to become the first couple to be married at the fast-food restaurant chain's new in-house wedding chapel in its Las Vegas flagship Taco Bell Cantina. Both are said to be fans of Taco Bell, with Ryckert noted as once spending 90 dollars ordering everything off of the Taco Bell menu. Listeners of The Giant Beastcast informed Ryckert of the competition which had entrants submitting their entries via social media. Ryckert learned that he had won while in Orlando, Florida for WrestleMania 33.
