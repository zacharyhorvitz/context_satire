 In an exclusive interview just hours after the death of George H.W. Bush, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reflected on the "remarkable American legacy" of the former President. "They don't make them like that very often," Pompeo told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Pompeo said he first got to know Bush as a member of Congress and then as CIA director -- the role Pompeo held prior to serving as secretary of state and a job Bush held for a year in 1976.  US President Donald Trump says China has agreed to cut tariffs on cars it imports from the United States. Trump made the announcement in a tweet late Sunday in the United States, saying Beijing will "reduce and remove" the tariffs, which currently stand at 40%. He didn't specify when the change would happen or what the new tariff level would be. White House adviser Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said Monday that no agreement had been reached on what the new tariff would be, but he expected levies to plummet.  The trait most important to being a "real American" is to believe in treating people equally, according to a Grinnell College poll released on Monday. Offered a list of traits, 90% of respondents said treating people equally is very important, followed by taking personal responsibility for one's actions (88% said that was very important), accepting people of different racial backgrounds (81%), and supporting the US Constitution (80%). The least important traits were being a Christian (55% said it was not important), having been born in America (49%), and having lived in America most of one's life (45%). Republicans and Democrats have different views on what makes a "real American," however.
