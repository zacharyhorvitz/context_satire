Oswald the Lucky Rabbit is an anthropomorphic black rabbit who is described metafictionally as Mickey's older half "brother" in the video game Epic Mickey. This is a reference to the fact that Oswald was Walt Disney's primary cartoon star before the creation of Mickey Mouse, though he was owned by Universal Pictures at the time. Disney's removal from the Oswald series in 1928 led to Mickey's creation. In 2006, The Walt Disney Company acquired the rights to Oswald, and have since used him in the Epic Mickey video game franchise. In the spring of 1988, NBC decided to renew its association with the company after it cut ties to the anthology series seven years earlier; the network brought the series, now named The Magical World of Disney, to serve as the lead-in of its Sunday lineup in September 1988. As the program had done during its last season as The Disney Sunday Movie, The Magical World of Disney ran for one hour, airing at 7:00Â pm Eastern Time; Michael Eisner also returned as its presenter. During this period, the show attempted to reintroduce the rotating format the show started out with in 1954. It also introduced new versions of Walt-era movies and TV shows such as The Absent-Minded Professor, a reboot of Davy Crockett, and the musical Polly, which was based on the book Pollyanna by Eleanor H. Porter and the Walt Disney's 1960 film adaptation of it. Generally, Mickey Mouse series movies are for entertainment purpose. Differing from traditional stories like Aesop's Fables, Disney animation generally do not avoid adult or mature scenes. In Hawaiian Holiday (1937), Goofy was in a scene of being in a grave. Disney arranged a laugh scene after that.
