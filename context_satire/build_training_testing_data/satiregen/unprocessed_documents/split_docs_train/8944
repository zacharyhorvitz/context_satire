 President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon signed a measure tying emergency funding for hurricane relief with measures that would raise the debt ceiling and keep the government open for three months. The measure was the result of a deal struck between Trump and Democratic leaders, to the consternation of many Republicans. The House had passed the bill, 316-90, earlier in the day. The 90 lawmakers who opposed the bill were all Republicans, who had just come out of a meeting with top administration officials urging them to support the package.  Congressional Democrats on Wednesday demanded a stand-alone vote on a solution for undocumented immigrants protected under DACA -- threatening to logjam the fall session if they don't get one. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer drew a line in the sand for Republican congressional leaders. "We're calling on (House Speaker Paul) Ryan and (Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell to immediately put the Dream Act for a vote on the floor in the House and Senate," Schumer said. "I'm confident that if put on the floor, it will garner overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle."  Democrats return to Washington this week for a new round of combat with Republicans desperate to deliver on their imperiled agenda. After a long spring and summer at the barricades, pushing back against President Donald Trump's attempts to bulldoze the legacy of his predecessor, the stakes are set. And with 2018 expected to be dominated by heated midterm congressional races, the coming months could be Trump's last best chance to revive his reeling presidency. "This fall, the insanity of the Trump era is likely to kick up a notch," MoveOn.org Washington Director Ben Wikler said.
