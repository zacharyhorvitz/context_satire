In Season 2, Shannon leaves Robby alone in their apartment to spend the summer with a boyfriend in Cabo San Lucas. Her boyfriend assures that he has paid the rent and the utility bills, but Robby discovers this as a lie, as he moves to the Larussos' home after receiving an eviction notice. By the end of summer, Shannon shows up at the LaRussos' home, begging Robby for forgiveness for all the mistakes she has made over the years and about to seek medical attention for her drinking and pill-popping. She also recommends that Robby seek out Johnny, as both his parents care for him. Nestor (Vas Sanchez) runs Reseda Flats Mini Mart at the strip mall. He displays no regard for hygiene by handing Johnny a slice of pizza with his bare hand and without a paper plate. He is seen in later episodes, one time approving a sale of beer to Hawk as he fails to detect Hawk's fake ID, another time remarking to Johnny he may have to close up shop as their landlord doubled their rent. Melissa (Gina Shaw) is a girl that hits on Johnny at the bar while he is in the middle of messaging Ali on Facebook. Johnny ultimately decides against it, however Melissa's accidental bump into him causes him to press "send", inadvertently sending the message. She hit on Johnny the same way he described to Miguel as the way to hit on a girl back in his day. Melissa is very attractive, and noticeable large-breasted while maintaining a thin frame.
