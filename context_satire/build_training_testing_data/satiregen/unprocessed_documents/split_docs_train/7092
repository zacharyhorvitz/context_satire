The 1990s saw the initial development of the Limited Too, Bath & Body Works, Structure, and Victoria's Secret Beauty. Later in 1998, several Bath & Body Works stores were converted to The White Barn Candle Company stores to begin a home fragrance brand. The Travel Body Care items are 3-ounce bottles of body lotion, shower gel, fine fragrance mists and body creams. The Aromatherapy collection also has a limited selection of products in the Travel Body Care collection. Bath and Body Works stocks a wide range of bath and beauty products in the United States. The retail store has products ranging from candles to hand soaps. The products are a part of one of the brand's main segments, body care, hand soaps and hand sanitizers and home fragrance.
