Leale, Taft, and another doctor, Albert King, decided that while Lincoln must be moved, a carriage ride to the White House was too dangerous. After considering Peter Taltavull's Star Saloon next door, they concluded to take Lincoln to one of the houses across the way. It rained as soldiers carried Lincoln into the street,where a man urged them toward the house of tailor William Petersen. In Petersen's first-floor bedroom, the exceptionally tall Lincoln was laid diagonally on the bed.  A woman who was arrested with a handgun outside of the White House Thursday night has been charged with a felony, accused of carrying a pistol without a license. April Debois, 23, of Mount Morris, Michigan, faces up to five years in prison after the Secret Service arrested her just minutes after President Barack Obama delivered his immigration speech. Debois, who was initially identified by authorities as April Lenhart, made her first court appearance on Friday in Superior Court. She will spend the weekend in jail and will be back in front of a judge on Monday morning. The White House is the official residence and workplace of the president of the United States. It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. and has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800. The term "White House" is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers.
