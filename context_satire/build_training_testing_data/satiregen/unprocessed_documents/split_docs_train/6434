Lord of the Swastika is lauded for its qualities as a great work of heroic fantasy. To further hammer the point, in an early edition, actual science fiction writers wrote fictional statements of praise for "Hitler's" writing skills for Spinrad to use as blurbs on the novel's back cover. Irony abounds in Whipple's review, as he argues author Hitler is obviously wrong in assuming that not much more than midnight rallies and phallic symbolism would create a large number of supporters for a movement. "After all", Dr. Whipple says, "it can't happen here", a reference to the political novel It Can't Happen Here. In Heldon proper, Feric dines in the "Eagle's Nest" tavern, and mulls over the question of how to change this situation. Should he enter politics or the military? Feric witnesses the oratory of Seph Bogel, leader of the Human Renaissance Party, who speaks eloquently but ineffectually to the crowd about the need for human purity. Fired by his words, Feric is inspired to take control of the listening crowd and leads a mob to the same border post, there to slay the Dominator (or "Dom") who had quietly disguised himself as a clerk to sway the immigration decisions in favor of mutants. Reviewer Michael Ward questions the plausibility of the alternate Hitler coming up with this particular fantasy. "The Hitler dreamed up by Spinrad had only briefly dabbled in German politics, and has written 'Lord of the Swastika' after several decades of living in America as a law abiding American citizen and science fiction writer. He has no way of knowing what career he would have had if he had not left Germany, in what ways it would have succeeded and how it would have failed."
