On September 24, 2009, State Department spokesperson Ian Kelly called Hatcher "one of our best" diplomats, and confirmed that Hatcher had been smeared with false media reports to discredit his work promoting human rights and religious freedom. Kelly noted that the State Department deplored this type of activity by the Russians at a time when diplomats like Hatcher were working to improve bilateral relations. Doug revolves around Douglas "Doug" Funnie, an 11 (later 12)-year-old boy who wants to be another face in the crowd, but by possessing a vivid imagination and a strong sense of morality, he is more likely to stand out. He keeps a journal, which he treats as an autobiography, as he records numerous experiences over the series, which range from learning to dance to getting a bad haircut. Doug Funnie and his family (which consists of his parents Theda and Phil, sister Judy, and dog Porkchop) move from the town of Bloatsburg to Bluffington after his dad receives a job promotion. Bluffington is in the United States but not in any specific U.S. state. Knowing that Lalo was aware of Werner, Gus uses the opportunity to craft a cover story to present to Lalo, that Werner was working on a chilling system for the chicken farm, had stolen some of their drugs and ran away, and thus Mike had been forced to chase and kill him. Gus also has Mike arrange to send Werner's men home discretely and paid in full, and seal the partially-constructed lab, halting construction while Lalo is suspicious. Gus assures Mike that Werner's widow was compensated for his death, but Mike scorns at his lack of compassion for Werner, whom he considered a good friend, and refuses to accept any pay. Mike spends the next several weeks getting drunk, leading to an unwanted altercation with Kaylee, and Stacey tells him she feel it best he stay away from them for a while.
