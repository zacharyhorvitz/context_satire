Later in the year, Terry is re-admitted to hospital. Fearing that he is dying, Tiffany relents and visits him. Before they know it, Tiffany and Simon are in charge of Terry's recovery and he persuades Tiffany to let him to stay in Walford with her, much to Grant's anger. Here, he begins a romance with fellow divorc√©e Irene Hills (Roberta Taylor), whom he had flirted with on his previous visit. It was announced that Gavin Richards quit the role in November 2001. He commented, "I had a wonderful time but feel I have to devote my energies to other projects." A source reportedly told the press that Richards had been unhappy in the role since the exit of his on-screen wife Irene (Roberta Taylor), as he felt that he had "not been given enough juicy storylines." Terry was not killed off in the soap; he departed in 2002 in search of his estranged wife. Terry recovers, and starts a letting agency with Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). When Janine's father Frank (Mike Reid) flees Walford, Terry takes her in and the two form an unlikely allegiance. Terry begins to view Janine as the daughter he never had, and Janine uses this to exploit money and attention from him, even purposefully dressing in a similar fashion to his dead daughter. Terry, meanwhile, seems oblivious to her scheme.
