Sometime later, Abra talks to Dan's spiritâ€”they assure each other that they will both be okay, and Dan disappears. Abra's mother learns to adjust with her daughter's powers, especially in communicating with the spirit of her deceased husband. In the final scene, Abra is confronted by the ghost of the rotting woman from the Overlook and prepares to lock the ghost up just as Danny did. He later said his years in school were the darkest and most bitter of his life.

In June 1847, Andersen paid his first visit to England and enjoyed a triumphal social success during the summer. The Countess of Blessington invited him to her parties where intellectual people could meet, and it was at one such party that he met Charles Dickens for the first time. They shook hands and walked to the veranda, about which Andersen wrote in his diary: "We had come to the veranda, I was so happy to see and speak to England's now-living writer whom I love the most."
