 If you suddenly burst into tears during a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade commercial break, your younger family members might've been startled. But they probably never dreamed of taking flight on a bike with an alien in the basket. E.T. -- yes, THAT E.T.!  It was the sight of a Thanksgiving miracle. Dozens of volunteers were hard at work one day before Thanksgiving preparing 600 delicious meals for the temporary residents of the Fort Worth animal shelter. There was a station for grain-free dehydrated dog food, another for pumpkins, another for green beans and another for chicken. "And we've got some runners moving all of (the meals) into the freezer, where they'll go until we feed the dogs tomorrow," the shelter said in a Facebook live video.  Presidents past and present are wishing Americans a happy Thanksgiving. President Donald Trump tweeted Thursday saying, "we are thankful to all who wear our Nation's uniform, allowing us to celebrate in safety and peace." First lady Melania Trump tweeted her gratitude to the military as well and wished Americans "a blessed Thanksgiving! Enjoy time with your family and friends."
