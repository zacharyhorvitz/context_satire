On July 5, 2018, President Trump tweeted, "I have accepted the resignation of Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this." At the time of his resignation Pruitt was facing numerous ethics investigations.  Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt says scientists who sit on EPA advisory boards and committees who have also received federal grants for studies could be cut from their roles as soon as next week, citing a lack of objectivity in their research. Speaking at a Heritage Foundation event on Tuesday, Pruitt said that scientists who serve on those advisory boards who have also received funding from the EPA may not be "objective." "There are dozens and dozens of these folks. Over the years these individuals, as they've served in those capacities, guess what's also happened?  The Environmental Protection Agency's acting science adviser is retiring, he told CNN Saturday. Robert Kavlock, who also serves as acting assistant administrator for the Office of Research and Development, will be leaving his position effective November 3, he said. He initially declined to explain the reasons behind his retirement, but in a follow-up email to CNN, he said he had worked at the agency for four decades "so it was not an early retirement." He added that "the time was right to go for a variety of reasons."
