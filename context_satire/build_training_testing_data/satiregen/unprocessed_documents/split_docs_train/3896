Andrew Jackson "Jack" Whittaker, Jr. (born c. 1947) won a 2002 lottery jackpot. His win of US$314.9 million in the Powerball multi-state lottery was, at the time, the largest jackpot ever won by a single winning ticket in the history of American lottery. After winning the lottery, he has had several brushes with the law and personal tragedies. After his career ended, Nelson's son Donnie remembers the family sitting in a Maid Rite restaurant in Moline, Illinois and Don saying he had three choices: sell cars, become an NBA referee, or accept an assistant's job under Milwaukee coach Larry Costello. They voted 5-0 for the Milwaukee job, which paid $25,000. Powerball's largest jackpot prize to date is $110 million and it was drawn on 18 July 2019. Three winners walked away with 36 million. The previous highest was $107 million, which was won by a woman in her 40s living in Sydney in January of 2019.
