He was semi-retired from show business by this time, and lived in a villa in Spain. He returned to acting in early 2007 and appeared in two episodes of the long-running ITV police drama series The Bill where he played the part of corrupt businessman Brian Stevens. This was his last broadcast television appearance at that time, though he had filmed a reality series for ITV entitled The Baron before his death; the network was undecided as to whether it would be aired but the programme started airing on 24 April 2008 on ITV1. Reid was the eventual winner, facing off against Suzanne Shaw after the departure of the other contestant Malcolm McLaren. The film is based on the 1972 novel of the same name by David Morrell. In the film, Rambo, a troubled and misunderstood veteran, must rely on his combat and survival senses against the abusive law enforcement of the small town of Hope, Washington. In April 1994, by which time the character of Frank Butcher was one of the most popular on British television, Reid took a long break from the show due to stress from acting out a depression storyline for the show. Later in 1994, he starred alongside other fellow EastEnders actors Barbara Windsor and John Altman in his classic adult pantomime Pussy in Boots, a spin-off of Puss in Boots where Reid played the main role of 'Big Dick'. In 1994 he provided a voiceover for one of the cows in the Anchor butter adverts. The advert was called "Anchor: Never Seen Anything Like It".
