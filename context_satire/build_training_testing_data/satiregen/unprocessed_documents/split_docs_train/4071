Anthony John Soprano (born 1959) is a fictional character and the protagonist in the HBO television drama series The Sopranos (1999â€“2007), portrayed by James Gandolfini. Usually referred to as Tony, the Italian-American character was conceived by The Sopranos creator and showrunner David Chase, who was also largely responsible for the character's story arc throughout the show's six seasons. The character is loosely based on real-life New Jersey mobster Vincent "Vinny Ocean" Palermo, a former caporegime (capo) and "de facto" boss of the DeCavalcante crime family. Bobby Boriello and Mark Damiano II portrayed Soprano as a child in one episode each; Danny Petrillo played the character as a teenager in three episodes. Gandolfini received widespread acclaim for his performance as Tony Soprano, the lead character in the HBO drama The Sopranos, a New Jersey mob boss and family man whose constant existential questioning includes regular psychiatric appointments. The show debuted in 1999 and was broadcast until 2007. For his depiction of Soprano, Gandolfini won three Emmys for "Best Actor in a Drama" and Entertainment Weekly listed him as the 42nd Greatest TV Icon of All Time. In addition to the awards that he won, Gandolfini received numerous nominations and two SAG Awards for being a member of the series' ensemble. Born in 2000, Gandolfini is the son of actor James Gandolfini. Growing up, Gandolfini enjoyed performing, but his father would generally discourage him from pursuing it as a career. Upon his father's death in June 2013, Gandolfini decided to pursue acting, enrolling at New York University. In his early audition efforts, he would get cast in the HBO drama series The Deuce as Joey Dwyer.
