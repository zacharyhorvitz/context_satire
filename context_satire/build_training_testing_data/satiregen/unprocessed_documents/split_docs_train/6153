 House Majority Leader Eric Cantor endorsed Mitt Romney as the Republican presidential nominee Sunday, and another key conservative, Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, also announced he was backing the former Massachusetts governor. Backing from the two conservative lawmakers is noteworthy because Romney is often painted by his rivals as too moderate. Both Coburn and Cantor represent states holding primaries on Tuesday. "Mitt Romney is the only candidate in the race who has put forward a pro-growth bold plan for job creation," Cantor, R-Virginia, told reporters Sunday. On January 15, 2010, Santorum sent an email and letter to supporters of his political action committee, saying, "I'm convinced that conservatives need a candidate who will not only stand up for our views, but who can articulate a conservative vision for our country's future". He continued, "And right now, I just don't see anyone stepping up to the plate. I have no great burning desire to be president, but I have a burning desire to have a different president of the United States". He formed a presidential exploratory committee on April 13, 2011. On May 2, 2012, Newt Gingrich "mothballed" his campaign saying that a second term of president Obama would be disastrous. Gingrich mentioned Republican front-runner Mitt Romney during his press speech, but did not endorse him. He intended to officially endorse Mr. Romney at a "to-be-scheduled event" featuring both Republican leaders. "Today I am suspending the campaign, but suspending the campaign does not mean suspending citizenship," Gingrich said, with his wife Callista at his side.
