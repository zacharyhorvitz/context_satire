Tower I was to be 53 floors and Tower II was to be 57 floors. Although not the tallest buildings proposed during the first Miami "Manhattanization wave" from 2006-2008, the towers were planned to be some of the more striking architecturally, and would have surpassed the Four Seasons Hotel Miami as the city's tallest building. Both towers were designed to be reminiscent of the Chrysler Building in New York City. The tops of the buildings were especially similar, with a "crown" at the top of each building and a similar spire. Michael Horváth, Martin Horváth’s brother, began with the magazine as the editor for the section on international book markets. Martin Horváth was a member of the editorial staff from 1989-1992 and was published by the magazine frequently. During his years in New York City, he was the magazine’s New York correspondent. With the new name of Brickell World Plaza, the building has a scheduled opening date of August 2011. The building developers, the Foram Group, have claimed that this slowed construction was strategic for the purpose of detail and that after completion they will move their corporate offices into the building. However, the near halt in construction and the loss of a major tenant suggests that the delay was not strategic, but due to the 2008 economic crisis and the falling demand for office space due to the excessive construction in Miami at that time.
