By July 2015, Ben Affleck was in talks to star in, co-write with Geoff Johns, and possibly direct a standalone Batman film. In March 2016, Johns claimed that the appearance of Robin's suit covered in graffiti from Dawn of Justice would be explored later and the identity of the deceased character was intentionally unspecified. (The film implies that Robin was murdered by the Joker and Harley Quinn.) Following the release of Dawn of Justice, William Morris Endeavor's co-CEO Patrick Whitesell confirmed that Affleck had written a screenplay for a standalone Batman film that he hoped would be optioned by Warner Bros as well to direct. In late 1962, at the height of television popularity and decline in moviegoing, DePatie was sent to a board meeting in New York, and he was informed that the cartoon studio was going to be shut down. DePatie completed the task by December 1963. Although Chuck Jones was fired in mid-1962, he helped DePatie's task by directing four more cartoons with his former unit. The cartoons were Hare-Breadth Hurry, Mad as a Mars Hare, Transylvania 6-5000 and To Beep or Not to Beep. After Kevin Tsujihara became chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. Entertainment, he promoted Nelson to the post of chief content officer of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. In 2013, Nelson detailed some of the future film plans for DC properties and stated that a Sandman film will be "as rich as the Harry Potter universe." Later that year, Nelson announced the decision to relocate DC's offices from New York City to Burbank, California. She explained that "it was never optimal to run any business, but certainly not a creative business, on two coasts."
