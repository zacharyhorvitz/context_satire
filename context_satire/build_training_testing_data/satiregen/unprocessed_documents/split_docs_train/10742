 Rescue efforts ramped up in the Philippines on Sunday to aid a quarter of a million people caught in the path of Typhoon Mangkhut, as authorities said dozens had been killed in the strongest storm of the year. Government officials reported Sunday that 54 people had died, with 42 missing. Efforts to locate those still missing will resume on Monday. President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque said most of the deaths were due to landslides, mainly in the Cordillera Administrative Region in northern Luzon.  A military intelligence assessment warned days after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico of a "high" potential for government failure on the island, new documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee reveal. "The potential for government failure and the resulting humanitarian crisis on Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands is high," reads the unclassified J-2 assessment obtained by the House Oversight Committee. The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings, is seizing on the newly obtained intelligence assessment to urge his Republican counterpart atop the committee to press the White House for documents related to the federal response in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The intelligence assessment, written five days after Maria struck Puerto Rico, was prepared for Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  President Donald Trump issued a strong warning to those in the path of Hurricane Florence, which is on track to hit the East Coast as a major storm later this week. "The Storms in the Atlantic are very dangerous. We encourage anyone in the path of these storms to prepare themselves and to heed the warnings of State and Local officials. The Federal Government is closely monitoring and ready to assist.
