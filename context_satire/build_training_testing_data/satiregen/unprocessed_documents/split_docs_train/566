Ivy League medical schools have some of the best reputations among medical schools in the United States. They are some of the oldest institutions of medical education, and leaders among medical research. They are also associated with some of the best hospitals in the United States. Some publications' most recent rankings of medical schools at these institutions are shown below. Some of the courses at the Extension School are "virtually identical" to courses offered to the traditional students at Harvard College, with "the only significant difference" being that many of the classes are taught in the evening or at night instead of during the day. Ropes, the school's first dean, said that "our aim will be to give the young people of Boston who have heretofore been prevented from securing a college education the same instruction they would receive were they undergraduates at Harvard." Founded in 1910 by President A. Lawrence Lowell, the Harvard Extension School grew out of the Lowell Institute, which was created according to the terms of a bequest by John Lowell, Jr. It was designed to serve the educational interests and needs of the greater Boston community, particularly those "who had the ability and desire to attend college, but also had other obligations that kept them from traditional schools." It has since extended its academic resources to the public, locally, nationally, and internationally.
