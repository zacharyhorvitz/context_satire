 Starbucks has closed more than half of its roughly 4,300 Chinese stores, as the deadly coronavirus continues to spread in the country. The company said Tuesday it is continuing to "monitor and modify the operating hours of all of our stores in the market," in light of the outbreak. "This is expected to be temporary," Starbucks added. Over the weekend, the company said that it was closing shops and suspending delivery services in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and the wider Hubei Province.  Our live coverage of Saturday's coronavirus outbreak has ended, but you can read more about the ongoing crisis here. The Wuhan coronavirus continues to spread around the world having already killed dozens of people and infecting hundreds in China. In the US, the first cases of coronavirus were confirmed this week; a man in his 30s who is under observation in Washington state and a Chicago woman in her 60s. Get caught up on the latest developments below: Outbreak is accelerating in China: Chinese President Xi Jinping chaired a meeting with top officials of the ruling Communist Party on the prevention and control of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, China’s state media reported Saturday.  Speaking on the 10th anniversary of the 2003 SARS crisis, Zhong Nanshan, one of the heroes in China's fight against that disease, described it as a "turning point" for the nation. "SARS forced the whole country to pay attention to the livelihood of the people," he said, before adding a warning. "We've made huge progress, but our footsteps are slow, especially in terms of healthcare." With the Wuhan coronavirus spreading across the country, killing at least 25 people so far, China is now facing a major test of just how much it has changed since 2003, both in terms of the healthcare system's ability to react to a new deadly pathogen -- and crucially, how the central government handles the developing crisis.
