 Surprising everyone -- including the guest of honor -- President Barack Obama awarded Vice President Joe Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction at a surprise sendoff event on Thursday. "This also gives the internet one last chance to talk about our bromance," Obama said. Challenge accepted, Mr. President. While the Obama/Biden bromance has been well-documented, Biden's surprise party was textbook. Joe Biden resigned from the Senate following his 2008 election to the vice presidency. Governor Ruth Ann Minner named former Joe Biden aide Ted Kaufman to fill the vacant seat, but Kaufman made it clear that he would not be a candidate in the 2010 special election. It fueled speculation Beau would run at that time. Biden's father stated after the announcement of Kaufman's appointment, "It is no secret that I believe my son, Attorney General, would make a great United States Senator just as I believe he has been a great attorney general. Biden declared his candidacy for president on January 31, 2007, although he had discussed running for months prior. It had been speculated that Biden would be offered and accept the position of Secretary of State because of his foreign policy experience and credentials. Biden rejected the notion outright, saying "Under no administration will I accept the job of Secretary of State". He stated that he was focused only on the presidency.
