At the beginning of 2016, the company named Joel Klein, former Assistant Attorney General and Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, as Chief Policy and Strategy Officer, and Brian West, former COO and CFO at Nielsen, as Chief Financial Officer. In 1975, Klein joined the legal team of the Washington, DC, non-profit Mental Health Law Project. The MHLP was an independent non-profit organization that brought class-action suits to establish rights for mentally and developmentally disabled clients. In that capacity, Klein specialized in constitutional and health-care. After working there for a year, he went into private practice, working for five years before founding a law firm with several partners. In 2007, Klein installed a computer system called The Achievement Reporting and Innovation System (ARIS), at a cost of $95 million, with records on 1 million current and former students. Teachers and parents were able to track student progress with the system. After Klein left his job as chancellor to work at the News Corp., a company owned by the News Corp. got a contract for nearly $10 million to manage the system in 2012. Subsequent News Corp. contracts were worth millions more.
