 People out West wear cowboy hats all the time. But pigeons? Las Vegas residents spotted two of the birds around town in tiny cowboy hats this week. No one seems to know how the birds got the hats, but it worries a local bird rescue group. Las Vegas  (Spanish for "The Meadows"), officially the City of Las Vegas and often known simply as Vegas, is the 28th-most populated city in the United States, the most populated city in the state of Nevada, and the county seat of Clark County. The city anchors the Las Vegas Valley metropolitan area and is the largest city within the greater Mojave Desert. Las Vegas is an internationally renowned major resort city, known primarily for its gambling, shopping, fine dining, entertainment, and nightlife. The Las Vegas Valley as a whole serves as the leading financial, commercial, and cultural center for Nevada.  Jason Aldean recently performed in Las Vegas, two years after 58 people were killed during one of his performances. The country superstar was playing the outdoor Route 91 Harvest Festival in October 2017 when a gunman opened fire from a nearby hotel. Hundreds were injured. And last month, a woman succumbed to injuries sustained in the violence.
