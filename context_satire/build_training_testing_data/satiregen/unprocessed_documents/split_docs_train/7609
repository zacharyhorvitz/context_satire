On 5 May 2014, WHO announced that the spread of polio was a world health emergency â€“ outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East were considered "extraordinary".  Thirty-three people have now died from the MERS coronavirus, the World Health Organization said Friday. Three new cases, including a fatality, were recorded in Saudi Arabia, the kingdom announced this week. Another previously reported Saudi Arabian patient also died from the disease, which lacks a cure or vaccine. Globally, there have been 58 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS, and all have been linked to the Middle East. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), also known as camel flu, is a viral respiratory infection caused by the MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Symptoms may range from mild to severe. They include fever, cough, diarrhea and shortness of breath. Disease is typically more severe in those with other health problems.
