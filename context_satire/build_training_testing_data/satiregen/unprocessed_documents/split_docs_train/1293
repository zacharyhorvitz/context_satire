The episode introduces Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor. Her predecessor Peter Capaldi departed from his role as the Twelfth Doctor after the tenth series, having played the role for three series. His final appearance was in the 2017 Christmas special, "Twice Upon a Time". Moffat stated in February 2017 that Chibnall tried to persuade the actor to continue into the eleventh series, but despite this, Capaldi still decided to depart. Jane Simon of The Mirror said of episode one; "Last week ended with the long-overdue sight of evil Janine from EastEnders (Charlie Brooks) lying dead on her desk with blood pouring from her neatly sliced wrists. Add to that little treat, the sight of Coronation Street actress Katy Cavanagh - Kirk's blonde other half - playing hardnosed Jane Tennison-type detective Polly Stuart. "I'm upgrading this to armed ops!" she barks tonight as the banking fraud she's nosing into turns ugly. Episode notes: Chef Fahr cut herself in the appetizer round. Fahr failed to notice the cut until after the round was complete, and enough blood was found on her station that the judges felt her dish was unsafe to eat.
