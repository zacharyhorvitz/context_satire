 Men between the ages of 55 and 69 -- particularly those at high-risk for prostate cancer -- should talk to their physicians about the pros and cons of prostate cancer screening, according to new guidelines released Tuesday. The guidelines, published Tuesday in the journal JAMA, come from the US Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts that makes recommendations to the American public about preventive services. They are an update to previous guidelines published in 2012 that recommended against routine screening due to the risks involved in additional testing and treatment. But according to new research, prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for men in the 55 to 69 age group could prevent 1.3 deaths and 3 cases of cancer metastases for every 1,000 men screened. The Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine has a distinct culture from that of most other medical schools. Mayo medical students wear business attire (often referred to as "Mayo wear") instead of white coats in the clinic to convey professionalism and respect for patients. Accordingly, there is no white coat ceremony—first-year students instead participate in a Commitment to Human Values ceremony in which they make their Physician's Pledge to Patients, Colleagues, and Society (adapted from  the Hippocratic Oath). The three main buildings at the site are the Davis Building, the Mayo Building (including the hospital) and the Cannaday Building. They are connected to two hotels, The Inn at Mayo Clinic and Marriott’s Courtyard Jacksonville Mayo Clinic/Beaches. Laboratory research is also conducted on Mayo’s campus. Mayo’s research is focused on cancer, neurological and neuro-degenerative diseases.
