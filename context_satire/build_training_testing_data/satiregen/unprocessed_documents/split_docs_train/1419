Megxit came to signify the break by the couple from the British royal family and formal royal protocol, and their plans for independence under their new brand, Sussex Royal. The term also reflects a widely reported assumption that Meghan was the driver of their announcement and is considered by some to be pejorative. "Megxit" was previously used by internet trolls against the Duchess. Prince Harry would later say, "The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back is not one I made lightly … there really was no other option". The engagement of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry was announced on 27  November 2017, but the speculation about the bride's dress had started even earlier. Some commentators suggested that Markle would not wear a white wedding dress as she had been married previously. In December 2017, Israeli designer Inbal Dror was asked to submit designs for a wedding dress. It was rumoured that Erdem and Ralph & Russo were also contenders. Thomas Markle Jr. was not invited to the wedding of Prince Harry and his half-sister, and at the time of the wedding, he had not seen her for about seven years. In an interview with the Daily Mirror in April 2018, Markle called his half-sister a "phony" who had "turned into a different person" and "forgotten her roots and her family" since becoming famous. He then sent Prince Harry a letter, asking him to call off the wedding – saying the upcoming wedding would be "the biggest mistake in Royal Wedding History", criticizing his half-sister's treatment of Thomas Markle Sr. by saying she had been "using her own father until he's bankrupt", and calling her "a jaded, shallow, conceited woman". However, he later wrote another letter in which Markle told his half-sister he was "sorry for venting my frustrations" after not being invited to the wedding and that he was "very proud" of her and wanted her "to have a great wedding and a long future with Prince Harry".
