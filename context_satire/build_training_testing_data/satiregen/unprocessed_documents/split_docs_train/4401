 You can't evacuate Ocracoke Island, on North Carolina's Outer Banks, just by jumping in your car and driving away. The wafer-thin, 16-mile long island doesn't have a bridge. You get to and from Ocracoke by ferry. And with Hurricane Florence bearing down on North Carolina's coastline, the ferry may be getting a lot of use.  As Paul Flaherty flew over Hurricane Florence, he didn't like what he was seeing. The storm was getting stronger and stronger. It grew from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane in 72 hours. Flaherty, flight director for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hurricane Hunters, saw the eye wall forming.  More than 1 million people on the southern East Coast of the United States faced mandatory evacuation orders as Hurricane Florence neared Category 5 strength Tuesday. Florence was upgraded twice Monday, from Category 3 to 4, prompting evacuation orders in coastal areas of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. One year after historic storms that ravaged the American Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico last year, officials warned not to underestimate the threat the storm poses. Residents boarded up their homes, formed long lines at gas stations and emptied the shelves of hardware stores and supermarkets.
