But being with them, it seems more like they are riding a massive wave of public support. On their plane, a flight attendant used the intercom to thank the students for their action following last month's massacre that killed 17 people at their school in Parkland, Florida.  Just five weeks ago, a gunman killed 17 of their friends and teachers at school and changed the course of their lives. This weekend, the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School led a historic march for gun control, what they called a March for Our Lives.

"Michelle and I are so inspired by all the young people who made today's marches happen," the tweet said. "Keep at it. You're leading us forward.
