 Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, a potential independent presidential candidate, apologized Thursday for claiming that he had "probably" spent more time with the military than any other 2020 candidate over the last decade. The remark earned a swift rebuke from Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg; the South Bend, Indiana, mayor is a veteran and was deployed in 2014. Buttigieg isn't the only 2020 presidential candidate with a significant military background. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who is also running, joined the Hawaii National Guard in 2002 and volunteered to deploy in 2004, serving two tours of duty, including in Iraq.  A little-known mayor in Florida plans to launch a presidential exploratory committee on Wednesday. Wayne Messam, the mayor of Miramar, Florida, told CNN he will launch his committee, making him one of the longest of longshots in the 2020 race. Messam, a 44-year-old African American Democrat who has led a town of 140,000 people since 2015, is little known outside of South Florida, has a small political operation and enters a field of more than a dozen Democratic candidates, many of whom have far larger profiles and fundraising bases. Messam accepts those odds, he told CNN in an interview, and is not afraid of the challenge of running for President as a relative unknown. On January 23, 2019, Pete Buttigieg announced the formation of an exploratory committee to run for President of the United States in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He had attracted speculation as a potential presidential candidate, notably following his visit to the early caucus state of Iowa in December 2018, where he announced that he would not seek reelection as mayor of South Bend.
