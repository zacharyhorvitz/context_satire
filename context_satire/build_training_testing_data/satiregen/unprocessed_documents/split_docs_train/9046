 There was a time when the presence of a black person on television was cause for celebration. In the early days of TV, black families would crowd around the set to catch a glimpse of the representation. Now that reverence for some has taken the form of being extremely protective of black stars, especially when they are accused of wrongdoing. From Michael Jackson to Bill Cosby and R. Kelly, the response from supporters of the men who have been accused of sexual misconduct has been almost as explosive as the allegations they all denied.  A statue of Michael Jackson has been removed from Britain's National Football Museum in the wake of fresh allegations of sexual abuse that continue to surround the pop superstar's legacy. Wade Robson and James Safechuck accused Jackson of sexually abusing them over a period of several years when they were children in a four-hour documentary "Leaving Neverland," the first part of which aired in the UK on Wednesday. Jackson's family has pushed back against the film, calling it a "public lynching." The musician's estate is suing HBO, which co-produced the documentary.  Part one of HBO's "Leaving Neverland" aired Sunday, and viewers heard graphic accounts of two men who accused Michael Jackson of sexually abusing them when they were children. The four-hour documentary examines the molestation accusations of two men -- Wade Robson and James Safechuck -- against Jackson, who died in 2009. Robson and Safechuck, now 41 and 37 respectively, allege the years of sexual abuse took place in the late '80s and early '90s. The Jackson family has called the film a "public lynching" and described Jackson's accusers as "admitted liars," in reference to sworn statements made by both Safechuck and Robson while Jackson was alive that he did not molest them.
