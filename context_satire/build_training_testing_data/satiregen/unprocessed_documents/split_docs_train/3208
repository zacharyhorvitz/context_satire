Glenbrook North has grown fourfold in the size of its student body since its founding. In 1979, the school opened the Sheely Center for the Performing Arts, and in 1990, a fieldhouse was dedicated. In the spring of 1996, a three-year renovation and construction project involving the science facilities and the “A” wing was built. A second swimming pool was built in 2000 to accommodate the burgeoning growth in aquatics. On February 6, 2019, it was announced that the shuttered Sears at Glenbrook Square Mall will be torn down under a plan to erect a new retail building in its place and a free-standing Portillo's eatery nearby. The Allen County Plan Commission received an application from New York-based Seritage SRC Finance LLC to develop the Shoppes at Glenbrook where Sears operated for five decades. The plan called for the Sears store and auto shop to be demolished, and a new retail building to be built, attached to the Glenbrook Square building. Announced tenants for this new wing include Dave & Buster’s, HomeGoods, and Portillo’s. As the oldest settlement on Lake Tahoe, Glenbrook played a significant part of Nevada's statehood as the main supplier of timber to the Comstock Lode and Virginia City. The first settlers of the valley, which included Captain Augustus W. Pray, arrived in 1860. Pray built a sawmill in 1861. The community took its name from the former "Glenbrook House hotel", which in turn was named after two primary local geographic features — Glen, a secluded valley, and Brook, a small stream.
