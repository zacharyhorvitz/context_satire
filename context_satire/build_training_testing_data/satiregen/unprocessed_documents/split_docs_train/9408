Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller (German: ; 10 November 1759 – 9 May 1805) was a German poet, philosopher, physician, historian and playwright. During the last seventeen years of his life (1788–1805), Schiller developed a productive, if complicated, friendship with the already famous and influential Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. They frequently discussed issues concerning aesthetics, and Schiller encouraged Goethe to finish works he left as sketches. This relationship and these discussions led to a period now referred to as Weimar Classicism. Rubbermaid is an American manufacturer and distributor of many household items.
