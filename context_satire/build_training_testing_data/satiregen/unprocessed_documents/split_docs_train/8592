In the first scene of the season, Jimmy is using his Gene Takavic alias while working at a Cinnabon in a shopping mall in  Omaha, Nebraska. The Cinnabon scenes in Better Call Saul are set in Omaha, but filmed at the Cottonwood Mall in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Following the deaths of Juan Bolsa and the Cousins, and Gus's subsequent establishment of the superlab, Don Eladio orders retribution through his henchman Gaff, hijacking meth deliveries and killing some of Gus's operatives. Gus agrees to Eladio's demands—the formula for the blue meth, the services of a chemist, and a 50% share in the business—and travels to the cartel's superlab with Mike and Jesse. After Jesse cooks a successful batch, Eladio invites the three to a party at his villa attended by multiple capos of the cartel, toasting their new business venture with a bottle of premium tequila supplied by Gus, and chiding the latter for needing to be kept in line every twenty years. However, shortly afterwards the capos begin to collapse, victims of a poison Gus had put in the tequila. On November 13, 2017, it was announced across various media outlets that Fullscreen would be shutting down its subscription service. The final full-length video episode of Not Too Deep with Grace Helbig was released the same day as the announcement. The podcast continued to air new audio-only episodes every Monday via iTunes and Soundcloud.
