In September 2010, Netanyahu agreed to enter direct talks, mediated by the Obama administration, with the Palestinians for the first time in a long while. The ultimate aim of these direct talks is to forge the framework of an official "final status settlement" to the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict by forming a two-state solution for the Jewish people and the Palestinian people. On 27 September, the 10-month settlement freeze ended, and the Israeli government approved new construction in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. On retiring from office in July 2011, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had said that Netanyahu was ungrateful to the United States and endangering Israel.  In the early hours of Thursday morning, Israeli forces conducted what was the largest attack on Syrian territory since the official end of the Yom Kippur War in 1974. The airstrikes were in response to what they said was an Iranian rocket attack on the Israeli-occupied Golan heights. This escalation is only the second time that Iran has been accused of directly targeting Israeli soil, following a failed drone attack in February. And it comes just days after US President Donald Trump's decision to walk away from the landmark nuclear deal agreed with Iran in 2015 -- pouring fuel onto a raging fire.  Israel claims it struck almost all of Iran's military capabilities in Syria after what it says was an Iranian missile attack on the Golan Heights. In the most direct confrontation between Israel and Iran to date, the regional enemies exchanged fire for hours late Wednesday. The extended barrage of fire comes amid soaring tensions between Israel and Iran, rivals battling for regional influence, and less than two days after the United States withdrew from the deal to curb Iran's nuclear program. In a YouTube statement Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had "crossed a red line," and that Israel's action was appropriate.
