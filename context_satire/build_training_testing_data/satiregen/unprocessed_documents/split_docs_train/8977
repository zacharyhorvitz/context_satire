The university's symbol, the Temple "T", was designed by students in a graphic arts and design class in the Tyler School of Art and Architecture in 1983. The “T” represents strength and positive character, with the open ends showing the free exchange of ideas that is the hallmark of a Temple education. The Temple T is referenced in the school's cheer, T For Temple U. The close relationship that the school maintained with Highland Park Baptist Church, one of the early megachurches of the modern era, created many ministry training opportunities for the students of Tennessee Temple. This model would be the inspiration for the Rev. Jerry Falwell to begin what would become Liberty University. Tennessee Temple's peak enrollment was more than 4,000 students in the early 1980s, but enrollment had dropped by 3,000 by 1991. The Founder's Garden near Liacouras Walk is the burial place of Russell Conwell, founder and 38-year president of Temple. Conwell used the income from his “Acres of Diamonds” speech to fund Temple as a place where working-class Philadelphians might receive higher education. It has been estimated that, during his lifetime, Conwell, who died at 82, helped more than 91,000 men and women to pursue higher education. A bust of Conwell marks his grave.
