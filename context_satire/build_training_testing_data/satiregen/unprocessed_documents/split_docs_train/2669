In 1960, despite the changes of personnel, the fortunes of the Four Lovers had not changedâ€”they failed an audition for a lounge at a Union Township, Union County, New Jersey bowling establishment. According to Gaudio, "We figured we'll come out of this with something. So we took the name of the bowling alley. It was called the Four Seasons." Once back in New York, Rothko and wife Mell visited the nearly-completed Four Seasons restaurant. Upset with the restaurant's dining atmosphere, which he considered pretentious and inappropriate for the display of his works, Rothko refused to continue the project, and returned his cash advance to the Seagram and Sons Company. Seagram had intended to honor Rothko's emergence to prominence through his selection, and his breach of contract and public expression of outrage were unexpected. In 1995, Lyla Novacek is a cellist studying at the Juilliard School and living under strict rule of her father. Louis Connelly is the lead singer of "The Connelly Brothers", an Irish rock band. They meet at a party after their respective concerts, and have a one-night stand on the rooftop. The day after, they separate in a hurry, and are unable to maintain contact as Lyla is ushered away by her father to Chicago.
