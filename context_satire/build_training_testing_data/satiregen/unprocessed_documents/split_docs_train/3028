 China has taken steps to support its financial system as the country's stock markets continue to suffer from high volatility. The People's Bank of China said Tuesday that it had injected 130 billion yuan ($19.9 billion) into the financial system. On Monday, markets suffered a dramatic 7% loss and trade was halted early. Markets continued to swing on Tuesday, and the Shanghai Composite ended with a 0.3% loss.  If you're looking for a reason to be scared of stocks in 2016, look no further than China. It took no time at all for fears about China's economic slowdown and market gyrations there to put U.S. investors in a bad mood this year. The Dow dropped as much as 467 points before recovering from the lows and ending the day down 276 points. And Nasdaq lost 2% on Monday, the first trading day of 2016, after stocks in China crashed overnight.  It's official. From January 1, 2016 China will allow two children for every couple. Chinese lawmakers rubber-stamped the new legislation Sunday during a session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, which governs the country's laws, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. "The state advocates that one couple shall be allowed to have two children," according to the newly revised Law on Population and Family Planning.
