TGI Fridays (formerly stylized as T.G.I. FRiDAYâ€™S) is an American restaurant chain focusing on casual dining. The company is owned by TriArtisan Capital, a New York-based private equity firm, that purchased the company from Sentinel Partners in October 2019. The name is asserted to stand for "Thank God It's Friday", although as of 2010 some television commercials for the chain have also made use of the alternative phrase, "Thank Goodness It's Friday."  The Justice Department has reached a settlement with American Airlines and US Airways that requires them to sell facilities at seven airports in order to complete their planned $11 billion merger to create the world's biggest carrier. The deal announced Tuesday allows low-cost airlines to increase their presence at Boston Logan, Chicago's O'Hare, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles, Miami, New York LaGuardia, and Washington National airports. The Justice Department and attorneys general from several states and the District of Columbia sued in August seeking to block the merger on grounds it would lead to higher prices and less service for consumers. Feeling cramped? The newer TGI Fridays franchises (as well as redesigned restaurants) are more contemporary, with wallpaper, granite exteriors, and red-and-white striped lamps instead of Tiffany. The exteriors have stucco, the entrance doors have "F"-shaped handles, and a metal cup above the door has a stripe saying "In Here, It's always Friday". The logo design was evolved in 2013 by Jane MacDowall and her creative team in Scotland. Most TGI Fridays have a propeller and a rowing scull on display as part of their antiques, which are actually a part of a story told to all TGI Fridays employees; the scull always contains a pair of saddle shoes and a bottle of champagne to remind employees of the value of teamwork, leadership, and celebrating success.
