 The field of candidates fighting for the Republican Party's presidential nomination is dwindling, leaving seven to compete in the prime-time GOP debate hosted by Fox Business Thursday night. Less than three weeks away from the February 1 Iowa caucuses, front-runner Donald Trump will once again take the center podium. He'll be flanked by Ted Cruz, his biggest threat in Iowa, and Marco Rubio, who is trying to unite the establishment behind him and fire up Republicans looking for a non-Trump or Cruz option. Three candidates who are running on their records of governing big states -- Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich -- will also be on stage, in one of the last prime-time opportunities to shape their narratives and boost their numbers before voting in Iowa begins.  Marco Rubio says Ted Cruz's attacks over immigration are about political calculation, not consistency, because Cruz, too, has changed his positions. Rubio unleashed an attack on his Republican presidential foe Sunday on ABC's "This Week" -- the latest episode in a series of exchanges between the two freshman senators. "When it comes to Ted, he has changed his position on immigration all over the place," Rubio said. "I mean, he used to be against birthright citizens -- or he used to be for birthright citizenship; now he says he's against it," he said.  And then there were 10 candidates on the debate stage. The first GOP presidential debate of the year hosted by Fox Business Network kicked off the election year with many moments best captured in GIFs. Here are the buzziest reactions from Thursday night's debate in North Charleston, South Carolina. The three remaining candidates in the undercard debate came out swinging with fierce facial expressions to match their attacks.
