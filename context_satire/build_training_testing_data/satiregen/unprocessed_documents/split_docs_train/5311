 It's political boom time in North Dakota, a state that stands at the center of the Republican nominating battle this weekend. With 25 free agent delegates in play Sunday and the race to 1,237 -- the number needed to win the Republican presidential nomination outright before July's convention -- perilously close, the three remaining Republican campaigns are shining a rare bit of attention on this state of 750,000. But unlike other states, it's not enough to win one contest here -- the state's delegates will remain free agents going to the convention, meaning they could easily swing the nomination. State party leaders tapped veterans for their 25 favorites on Saturday, nominating Gov.  The Tennessee Republican Party on Saturday approved its final slate of 2016 delegates over the objections of Donald Trump's supporters, who claimed party leaders were trying to unfairly appoint delegates who don't support the GOP front-runner. Trump won Tennessee's primary on March 1 with 38.9% of the vote, capturing 33 of the state's 58 pledged delegates. But those delegates are only bound to Trump through the first two rounds of balloting at the Republican National Convention in July, meaning that delegates who aren't loyal to the GOP front-runner -- or any other 2016 hopeful -- could switch to a different candidate on a third ballot. And Tennessee rules offer delegates pledged to a candidate who has withdrawn from the race -- such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who picked up nine delegates -- "the right to attend the convention."  Donald Trump met with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus Thursday in Washington, hours after gathering his foreign policy advisers at the site of his new hotel. "Just had a very nice meeting with @Reince Priebus and the @GOP. Looking forward to bringing the Party together --- and it will happen!" Trump tweeted.
