 President Donald Trump defended the National Rifle Association on Thursday as a nationwide debate boils on gun control. After a long string of tweets defending his position that some teachers should carry guns, Trump offered his backing to the NRA and its executives. "What many people don't understand, or don't want to understand, is that Wayne, Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots," Trump wrote, referring to executive vice president Wayne LaPierre and executive director Chris Cox. "They love our Country and will do the right thing," Trump wrote.  No one knows exactly where President Donald Trump will come down on new gun policy and that uncertainty is causing problems in Washington. On Wednesday, Trump flummoxed Republicans by expressing openness to a myriad of Democrat-sponsored proposals during an hourlong televised White House meeting with lawmakers. On Thursday night, he met with National Rifle Association leaders, who tweeted afterward: "POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don't want gun control." But Trump said the opposite on Wednesday.  Teachers have taken to social media in the midst of a gun control debate following the Parkland, Florida, school shooting to push for an increase in classroom resources -- not the ability to carry guns in school. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump suggested that some teachers be armed, calling it a "great deterrent" to mass shootings on campus. Using the hashtag #ArmMeWith, teachers are proposing other resources they would rather be armed with, such as more funding, additional school counselors and smaller class sizes. Olivia Bertels, a middle school English teacher in Kansas, and Brittany Wheaton, an English teacher in Utah, said they started the #ArmMeWith movement on Tuesday in response to the suggestion that more guns in schools would help make them safer.
