 Less than 12 hours after stepping off the debate stage in Cleveland, Chris Christie arrived here Friday to make a pitch to 900 conservative activists that he has the mettle to be the next commander-in-chief. His appearance was risky but strategic as the New Jersey governor is not necessarily beloved by this audience -- many of whom question if he is a true conservative. The night before, at the Red State debate watch party, the audience booed Christie several times when he appeared on the large screens in a hotel ballroom. Red State attendees tend to be more politically aligned with the likes of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov.  Donald Trump loves the spotlight and the camera. But when he takes center stage Thursday night, it won't be as the star of a reality TV show -- it will be as the Republican Party's front-runner presidential candidate. Trump and nine of his GOP rivals will battle it out in the 2016 cycle's inaugural GOP primary debate, hosted by Fox News in Cleveland. The stakes are high, as each participant clamors to stand out from a nearly unprecedented pack of 17 declared GOP candidates.  Chris Christie is heading into the first Republican presidential debate of the election season in a position he likely never expected: near the bottom. The New Jersey governor, initially viewed as a top-tier candidate, is in danger of not making it into next week's prime-time Fox News debate because of low polling numbers. Instead, he could be relegated to an earlier debate with candidates who are polling in the low single digits. His challenge was underscored Thursday when a Quinnipiac University poll found Christie slipped to tenth place nationally, his lowest showing since the group began polling for the 2016 presidential primary.
