 The United States believes talk of military strikes against Iran's nuclear program is "premature" and has advised Israel that an attack would be counterproductive, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says. In an interview aired Sunday on CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS," Gen. Martin Dempsey said U.S. officials aren't convinced Iran has decided to pursue nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, economic and diplomatic sanctions are taking a toll on the Islamic republic, he said. "On that basis, I think it would be premature to exclusively decide that the time for a military option was upon us," Dempsey said.  Iran warned Tuesday it would strike against an "enemy" threatening it if needed to protect its national interests -- even if the enemy didn't attack first. Gen. Mohammad Hejazi, a deputy head of Iran's armed forces, said his country "will no more wait to see enemy action against us," according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. "Given this strategy, we will make use of all our means to protect our national interests and hit a retaliatory blow at them whenever we feel that enemies want to endanger our national interests," Hejazi said. 5 voices: Will tensions lead to war?  Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak called Saturday for even tougher sanctions on Iran to force the Islamic republic to abandon its nuclear ambitions. "I think there is consensus now in most of the capitals of the world that Iran should not be allowed to turn into a military nuclear power," Barak told reporters  in Tokyo. "There is a consensus at least in the West and North America that no option should be removed off the table in regard to dealing with the threat. We feel the same," he said.
