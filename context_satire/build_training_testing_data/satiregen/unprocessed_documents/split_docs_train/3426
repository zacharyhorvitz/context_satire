Jensen was also driving north on Highway 2 in his green Pontiac Sunfire in search of Stepple. After the argument in the pub, Jensen had reportedly kept phoning Stepple and had told her "This night's not going to end well for you, I hope you know that". In Claresholm, Jensen located the group at a 7-Eleven convenience store. The four of them had stopped there briefly at around 3 a.m. on the morning of December 15. On the night of December 14, 2011, a group of Jensen's friends took him out to a pub in Lethbridge. Inside, Jensen came across Stepple, who was hanging out with two other guys, 20-year old Mitch Maclean and 22-year-old Tanner Craswell. The two of them were rising baseball stars who had moved to Lethbridge from Prince Edward Island to play for the Lethbridge Bulls baseball team. 21-year-old Shayna Conway was also with them, and was the girlfriend of Craswell, who was out celebrating his 22nd birthday. After winning the 1993 French Open with Luke, the Jensen brothers became a center-court attraction. Murphy turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with the stress of his new-found success and celebrity status. In 1999, after missing a mixed-doubles match at Wimbledon with Brenda Schultz-McCarthy, Jensen lost in the first round of the 1999 US Open. Feeling the pressure of work and family responsibilities (his son, William, was born during the tournament), Jensen found himself in the throes of addiction.
