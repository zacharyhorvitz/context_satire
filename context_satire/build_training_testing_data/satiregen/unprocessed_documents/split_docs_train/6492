 Reinforcements are coming to a violent Chicago. As a major part of a plan to combat crime -- including the city's worst homicide rate in decades -- the police department said it will be adding nearly 1,000 positions to ranks. The hires, which will take place over two years, will include more than 500 new patrol officers and 92 field training officers to help train the new recruits, Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters Wednesday. There will also be promotions for existing officers, with 200 new detectives, 112 new sergeants and 50 new lieutenants, he said. The Chicago Tribune assessed Emmanuel's performance as mayor as "mixed." Some saw him as making meaningful reforms, while others criticized him as mayor-for-the-wealthy. Test scores rose in schools but his decision to close schools in economically hard hit neighborhoods was controversial. Chicago's downtown boomed, attracting corporate headquarters but other areas of the city saw population losses.  Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Thursday delivered what was one of the most important speeches of his second term. It addressed the city's issues with policing, as well as its growing epidemic of violence. In 2016, Chicago's homicide rate skyrocketed and is on pace to top 700, up from 480 over last year. Emanuel and his administration must repair the community's trust in his leadership and police in the wake of multiple scandals and shootings involving officers.
