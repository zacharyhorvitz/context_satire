 Dozens of senators attempted to take swipes at Mark Zuckerberg in his debut on Capitol Hill. None appeared to land a significant blow. The Facebook CEO formally apologized to Congress on Tuesday for mistakes that led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal and stressed that his company is rethinking its responsibility to users and society. "It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well.  Mark Zuckerberg has a clear message for Congress in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal: It's my fault. The Facebook CEO will take the blame for mistakes that led to the data debacle and lay out steps taken to prevent it from happening again, according to a copy of Zuckerberg's remarks as prepared for delivery to one of the committees before which he will be testifying. "It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well. That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy," Zuckerberg said in the prepared remarks, which were released by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on Monday.  Mark Zuckerberg survived his first grilling by Congress. The second round was more difficult. The Facebook CEO was pelted with tough questions on the company's data collection practices and the need for new regulation during a five-hour hearing with the House Energy and Commerce Committee Wednesday. It was his second and final hearing this week in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, bringing the once press shy CEO's total time testifying on Capitol Hill to about ten hours.
