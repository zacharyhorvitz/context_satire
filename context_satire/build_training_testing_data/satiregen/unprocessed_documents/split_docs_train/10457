Tom Jumbo-Grumbo (voiced by Keith Olbermann) is a blue whale who is a newsman and pundit on MSNBSea (a parody of MSNBC). Tom often reports on BoJack's misdeeds and other happenings in Hollywoo, often through alliteration. Whenever something goes wrong on the air, he blames it all on an off-screen presence only known as "Randy", and makes various jokes at the expense of his squid ex-wife Shannon, though he usually immediately apologizes afterwards. In her 1999 autobiography, Frederica Maas claimed that the idea for the movie had been stolen from her and her husband Ernest Maas. She said the story was based on the life of her husband's father, who similarly had abandoned his family after making horrible mistakes in his personal life. They named the script "Beefsteak Joe" and presented it to Emil Jannings. As a fellow German-American, Ernest had thought Jannings would help them get the script made into a movie. Emerson occasionally covered or sampled other musical works in his compositions. Permission to use pieces was sometimes denied by the composer or his family; for example Gustav Holst's daughter refused to grant official permission for rock bands to perform her late father's composition Mars, the Bringer of War. However, a number of composers did grant permission for their works to be used. Aaron Copland said that there was "something that attracted " about ELP's version of "Fanfare for the Common Man", and so approved its use, although he said, "What they do in the middle (i.e., the modal section between repeats of Copland's theme), I'm not sure exactly how they connect that with my music".
