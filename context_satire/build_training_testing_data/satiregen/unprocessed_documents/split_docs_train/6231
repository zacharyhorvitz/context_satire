At 5:42 p.m. on February 20, 2005, Thompson died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at Owl Farm, his "fortified compound" in Woody Creek, Colorado. His son Juan, daughter-in-law Jennifer, and grandson were visiting for the weekend. His wife Anita, who was at the Aspen Club, was on the phone with him as he cocked the gun. According to the Aspen Daily News, Thompson asked her to come home to help him write his ESPN column, then set the receiver on the counter. Scott expressed his interest to shift from comedic roles into more serious roles and portrayed Ted Morgan in the comedy-drama film, Just Before I Go (2015). "It was rewarding to play pretty much the antithesis of what I've done in the past. To get a chance to play a totally different character—because he's just a good, average, relatable guy going through obviously an awful moment in his life—was great," Scott told Variety. He reprised his roles as Crash in Ice Age: Collision Course (2016) and as Doug 'The Thug' Glatt in Goon: Last of the Enforcers (2017). After leaving the Air Force, Thompson worked as sports editor for a newspaper in Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania before relocating to New York City. There he audited several courses at the Columbia University School of General Studies. During this time he worked briefly for Time as a copy boy for $51 a week. While working, he used a typewriter to copy F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms in order to learn about the writing styles of the authors.
