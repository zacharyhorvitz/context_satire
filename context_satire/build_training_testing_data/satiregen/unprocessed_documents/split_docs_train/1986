 One of China's biggest tech companies is under investigation amid outrage over the death of a university student whose family claims it used its Internet search engine to look for medical treatments. Baidu has found itself at the center of a social media storm that has raised questions over how accountable Internet firms are to their users over the search results they provide. News of the probe by Chinese authorities prompted Baidu's stock to plummet nearly 8% in New York on Monday. The company, which runs the dominant search engine in China, was mentioned in a widely shared online post written in February by Wei Zexi, who was suffering a rare form of cancer.  Facebook may be blocked in China, but that hasn't stopped it from scoring a legal victory in a trademark fight with a local food and drink company. A court in Beijing recently ruled that Zhongshan Pearl River Beverages shouldn't have been allowed to gain access to the "face book" trademark in the world's most populous country. The Chinese company first registered the term in 2011 for categories including food, beverages and snacks. Despite objections from Facebook, the Chinese company was granted approval to use the brand by a trademark regulatory body in 2014.  Uber's big Chinese rival, Didi Chuxing, has suffered a setback after a driver for the company was arrested on suspicion of robbing and killing a female passenger. Local police in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen said they began investigating after receiving a missing persons report Tuesday morning from a man who couldn't reach his wife after she ordered a taxi from a ride-hailing app on Monday. Authorities were able to track down a person suspected of being the driver later Tuesday. The suspect said he forced the woman to hand over valuables before killing her, according to a police statement.
