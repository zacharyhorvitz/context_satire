 He put his teacup down with the deliberation of a man about to choose his words carefully. "Look," he said. "It's getting increasingly hard to believe our Kingdom's version of events. So many parts of the story don't add up, or they require a leap of faith that no one could be expected to make."  The Trump White House may have too much at stake to make Saudi Arabia pay a proportionate price for the apparent murder of Jamal Khashoggi. If Riyadh finds a scapegoat and absolves senior members of the royal family over the disappearance of The Washington Post columnist in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago, Trump may accept it. For multiple geopolitical and domestic political reasons, the administration has far more to gain from helping engineer a face-saving exit for itself and its ally from its biggest foreign policy crisis in nearly two years in office than by making an example of the Saudis in a belated stand for human rights. The kingdom forms the foundation of President Donald Trump's Middle East policy, and a decision to severely punish its rulers could spark an estrangement that would cripple his hopes of confronting Iran.  What do you give the man who has everything? The answer, it seems, is an indemnity from the White House for complicity in an alleged murder. Mohammed Bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, or MBS as he is known, is widely believed to own a $500M mega-yacht, one of the world's most expensive houses, a sumptuous chateau outside Paris and last year to have set a new art world record for the most expensive painting, Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi which he picked up for a snip at $450M. His minions, Saudi Arabia has now admitted, were involved in the demise of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi almost three weeks ago.
