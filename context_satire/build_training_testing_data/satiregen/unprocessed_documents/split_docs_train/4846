McKeague's job with the RAF was not a contributory factor, according to the lead detective in the investigation. Intended disappearance was also put in doubt by McKeague's happy mood at the time; he was making plans to meet up with his brother, Darroch, on the night that he went missing, with his last text being sent at 03:08 am. He had also booked flights to go home to Dunfermline for Halloween. His mother also pointed out that he loved his dog which he kept at RAF Honington and would not have left it behind intentionally. Writing later of the incident, Paul recounts: "I opposed  to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong". Paul reports that he told Peter: "You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?" Paul also mentions that even Barnabas (his travelling companion and fellow apostle until that time) sided with Peter. In April 2018, Corrie McKeague's father, Martin, acknowledged that his son was probably dead and that he hoped to hold a memorial service in the summer of 2018 to "help him and loved ones gain some closure following the police’s decision ." Some people, including McKeague's father in an interview with the UK tabloid Daily Mirror, had suggested the possibility that Corrie McKeague had killed himself because of the pressures of fatherhood. This was refuted by the rest of the family who explained that the first text notifying McKeague that April Oliver was pregnant did not get sent to his phone until after he had disappeared.
