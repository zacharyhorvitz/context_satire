 With one tweet Friday morning, President Donald Trump made sure the latest impeachment inquiry hearing would be must-see TV. Throughout the House Intelligence Committee's hearings so far, Trump has been the elephant not in the room. So, perhaps it was inevitable that he would somehow insert himself into the hearings as he did Friday with the ex-ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch -- using his favorite tool of communication, Twitter. As Yovanovitch began her testimony, Trump tweeted: "Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad.  Former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified publicly on Friday in the impeachment inquiry, telling her story about how President Donald Trump recalled her from Ukraine and how she felt "intimidated" by his real-time attacks against her on Twitter. The career diplomat was sworn in shortly after 9 a.m. ET and answered questions for several hours before the House Intelligence Committee. Things will heat up next week on Capitol Hill, with three days of impeachment hearings scheduled, and Yovanovitch's appearance gave some clues for how future hearings might play out. Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine with 30 years of foreign service, has surfaced as a key person in the impeachment inquiry. She was recalled in May 2019. On October 11, 2019, Yovanovitch told House impeachment investigators she had been informed by Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan that Trump had been pressuring the State Department to remove her from her post in Ukraine since the summer of 2018. When notified of her removal, Sullivan assured her that she had done nothing wrong and was not being recalled for cause.
