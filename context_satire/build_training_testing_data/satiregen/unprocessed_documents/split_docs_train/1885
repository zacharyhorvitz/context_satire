 It's become as much a campaign ritual as chowing down on fat-laden food on a stick and working the rope line at rallies: the pilgrimage by White House hopefuls to the Holy Land. Serious presidential candidates, especially Republicans, now routinely extend the campaign trail to Israel to vow solidarity to the Jewish state, bolster their foreign policy credentials and impress pro-Israel donors and evangelical voters back home. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who Tuesday started a trip to the country, is only the latest in a long line.  Bank of New York Mellon will pay $15 million to settle charges that it violated an anti-bribery law by hiring interns that were relatives of Middle Eastern officials. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that BNY Mellon breached the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 2010 and 2011 when bank employees "sought to corruptly influence foreign officials in order to retain and win business managing and servicing the assets of a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund," according to an agency statement. "These officials sought, and BNY Mellon agreed to provide, valuable internships for their family members," the SEC said. "BNY Mellon provided the internships without following its standard hiring procedures for interns, and the interns were not qualified for BNY Mellon's existing internship programs." The Middle East is a transcontinental region which includes Western Asia (although generally excluding the Caucasus) and all of Egypt (which is mostly in North Africa). The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to the Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. The broader concept of the "Greater Middle East" (or Middle East and North Africa) also adds the Maghreb, Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and sometimes even Central Asia and Transcaucasia into the region. The term "Middle East" has led to some confusion over its changing definitions.
