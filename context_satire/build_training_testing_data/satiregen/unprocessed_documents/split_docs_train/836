In 1961, Mort Walker and Jerry Dumas, who had worked together on Beetle Bailey and Hi and Lois, created Sam's Strip, in which the title character and his unnamed assistant were aware that they were in a comic strip. The series debuted as a daily-only on October 2 of that year and relied heavily on metahumor, appearances by classic comic strip characters, and breaking the fourth wall. It never reached more than sixty newspapers and was discontinued on June 1, 1963. Among everything, Mr. B constantly makes passes against the receptionist Marsha (Melanie Mayron) as an escape from his troubled home life. Mr. B is constantly tense and worried throughout the film as he fears about his car wash going out of business due to a competitor a few miles down the street. Lonnie, on the other hand, is full of ideas on how to save the car wash that he cannot get Mr. B or anyone else to listen to, mostly due to Mr. B being a cheapskate. In 2008, Fargas acted in the British boxing film Sucker Punch. He appeared in an episode of Fox's Lie to Me as the father of a murdered firefighter.
