 President Barack Obama surprised an emotional Vice President Joe Biden Thursday by presenting him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, during a White House ceremony. "For your faith in your fellow Americans, for your love of country and for your lifetime of service that will endure through the generations, I'd like to ask the military aide to join us on stage," Obama said in the ceremony. "For my final time as President, I am pleased to award our nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom." Biden, who appeared extremely emotional during the tribute and was seen tearing up, accepted the award but said he did not deserve it.  Surprising everyone -- including the guest of honor -- President Barack Obama awarded Vice President Joe Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction at a surprise sendoff event on Thursday. "This also gives the internet one last chance to talk about our bromance," Obama said. Challenge accepted, Mr. President. While the Obama/Biden bromance has been well-documented, Biden's surprise party was textbook. Will Tracy, an associate editor at The Onion, told the New York Times in 2010 that the Office of the Vice President had sent the Onion staff an email with the message "Keep it up. He really likes it." Tracy commented, "Apparently he's a fan." Biden's office denied being aware of any communication between the Vice President and The Onion.
