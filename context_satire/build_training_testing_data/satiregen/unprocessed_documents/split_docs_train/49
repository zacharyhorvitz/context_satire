 Authorities are looking into a "suspicious letter" delivered to the residence of Republican Sen. Susan Collins in Bangor, Maine, local law enforcement said at a news conference Monday. "Today at 1:39 p.m., we responded to a residence on West Broadway to investigate a suspicious letter," Bangor Police Department Sergeant Wade Betters said ahead of the news conference. "Members of our Criminal Investigation Division are currently on scene and the investigation is ongoing. The Bangor Fire Department and a HAZMAT team from Orono, Maine are assisting the investigation," Betters said.  Authorities in Maine have confirmed that remains of a woman found Friday are those of a teacher who had been missing for almost a week. The body of Kristin Westra was discovered near her home in a wooded area in North Yarmouth, Maine, the Cumberland County Sheriff's Department said. Authorities said Sunday they have determined she died by suicide. Westra, 47, disappeared Monday in the Portland suburb of 3,600 residents.  To many, Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the US Supreme Court is not just a victory for President Donald Trump, but for Trumpism at large. And it is this fact that unsettles so much of the nation. Trump's presidency is marked not by political ideology but by personality. As former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Republican, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria, "We the people" has been replaced by "me the president."
