Afterwards, Knievel retired from major performances and limited his appearances to smaller venues to help launch the career of his son, Robbie Knievel. His last stunt show, not including a jump, took place in March 1980 in Puerto Rico. However, Knievel would officially finish his career as a daredevil as a touring "companion" of his son, Robbie, limiting his performance to speaking only, rather than stunt riding. His last appearance with Robbie (on tour) was in March 1981 in Hollywood, Florida. At the end of several extended chase scenes, the drug lords are defeated, Will and his son are reunited, and Kate has fallen head over heels for Knievel. The film ends with Knievel performing a daredevil jump over a pit of fire, this time successfully. The career jumps and stunts of motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel spanned from 1965 to 1980. As a professional daredevil, Knievel attempted or successfully jumped over 75 ramp-to-ramp motorcycle jumps, as well as, his failed 1974 X-2 Skycycle rocket jump. The majority of his jumps were made on the Harley-Davidson XR-750 motorcycle.
