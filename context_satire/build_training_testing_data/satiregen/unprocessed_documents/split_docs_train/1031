"Outsourcing is no longer just for Fortune 500 companies. Small and mid-sized firms, as well as busy professionals, can outsource their work to increase their productivity and free time for more important commitments. It's time for the world to take advantage of this revolution." As America’s Doctor, Murthy made it a point to travel extensively - from remote fishing villages in Alaska to American Indian reservations in Oklahoma, to schools, workplaces, homes of worship and community centers across the nation - to hear firsthand about people’s experiences, struggles, and hopes. Vivek Hallegere Murthy (born July 10, 1977) is an American physician and was a vice admiral in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps who served as the 19th Surgeon General of the United States. Murthy, who founded the nonprofit Doctors for America, succeeded Boris Lushniak, who had been Acting Surgeon General since 2013. Murthy was the first Surgeon General of Indian descent and, while serving in office, was the youngest active duty flag officer in federal uniformed service.
