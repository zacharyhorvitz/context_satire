 Iran has released Australian couple Jolie King and Mark Firkin and dropped the charges against them, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Saturday. The two social media influencers were detained in July for taking illegal photos with a drone, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. "For Jolie and for Mark, the ordeal that they have been through is now over," Payne said at a press conference in Sydney.

The flakes of grain, which the Kellogg brothers called granose, were a very popular food among the patients. The brothers then experimented with other flakes from other grains. In 1906, Will Keith Kellogg, who served as the business manager of the sanitarium, decided to try to mass-market the new food. At his new company, Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, he added sugar to the flakes to make them more palatable to a mass audience, but this caused a rift between his brother and him. Will Kellogg continued to develop and market flaked cereal. When he proposed adding sugar to the flakes, John would not agree to the change. So, in 1906, Will started his own company, the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company. This marked the start of a decades-long feud between the brothers.
