The dress along with other items pertaining to the Royal Wedding were exhibited at Buckingham Palace from 23 July 2011 until 3 October 2011. The method of displaying the dress and tiara (on a headless mannequin lit by white lighting) was reported to have been described as "horrid" by the Queen during a private tour of the exhibition with the Duchess of Cambridge in July 2011. A microphone overheard the Queen remarking to the Duchess "It's made to look very creepy" while Catherine responded that it had a "3D effect". The dress helped attract a record number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the summer months of 2011.  With fanfare fit for a prince, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and husband Prince William welcomed their first child Monday. The baby boy was born at 4:24 p.m., weighing 8 pounds, 6 ounces. A name has not yet been announced for the child, who is third in line to the throne. "Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well," read an official bulletin placed outside Buckingham Palace, where crowds erupted in cheers.  The world is eagerly waiting to hear news of the birth of the royal baby. A royal source told CNN that the due date was Saturday, July 13, which would mean that the Duchess of Cambridge is several days overdue. Why is it taking the future prince or princess of Cambridge so long to arrive? First-born babies are less likely to arrive on time -- they're either too early or too late, studies have found.
