 Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday announced the Department of Justice's creation of a "religious liberty task force" to "help the department fully implement our religious guidance." In a speech at the Department of Justice's Religious Liberty Summit in Washington, Sessions said the goal of the task force will be protecting religious groups from persecution. "The task force will help the department fully implement our religious liberty guidance by ensuring that all Justice Department components are upholding that guidance in the cases they bring and defend, the arguments they make in court, the policies and regulations they adopt and how we conduct our operations," Sessions said. "That includes making sure that our employees know their duties to accommodate people of faith."  Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended Rod Rosenstein on Thursday, saying he has "the highest confidence" in him one day after House conservatives introduced a resolution to impeach the deputy attorney general overseeing the special counsel Russia investigation. "My deputy Rod Rosenstein is highly capable. I have the highest confidence in him," Sessions said during a news conference in Boston when asked about the impeachment effort against Rosenstein. On Wednesday, GOP Reps. Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan took aim at Rosenstein by introducing a resolution to impeach.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions is an "embarrassment " and a "disgrace" for repeating and laughing at a chant of "lock her up," Rep. Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday. The crowd at a conservative group's high school leadership summit began chanting the phrase "lock her up" during Sessions' speech Tuesday. Sessions repeated the words before chuckling during his talk about free speech and conservative principles. The chant, a rallying cry from President Donald Trump's campaign events, calls for jailing Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee in the 2016 race and Trump's opponent.
