 Sen. Bernie Sanders has raised $18.2 million from 525,000 individual donors since entering the Democratic presidential primary in February, his campaign said Tuesday. One in five of those donors gave to Sanders for the first time, campaign manager Faiz Shakir told reporters. That total, amassed over 41 days culminating with Sunday's quarterly deadline, means Sanders enters the second phase of the campaign with $28 million in cash-on-hand. Sanders' first quarter haul exceeded that of California Sen. Kamala Harris, who announced about a month earlier; she raised $12 million, her campaign said on Monday night.  Make no mistake: There is a clear path to the Democratic presidential nomination for Sen. Bernie Sanders. His strong fundraising numbers are just the latest sign that Sanders 2.0 has a better shot of succeeding than his first bid in 2016. Sanders has reported raising $18.2 million in the first six weeks of his 2020 presidential campaign. He'll likely come in first or a close second place for money raised this quarter. In April 2016, campaign finance watchdogs and Sanders supporters expressed concerns about the Hillary Victory Fund, which Clinton supporters represented as a fundraising committee composed of Clinton's presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and 32 state party committees. The setup allowed Clinton to bypass donation limits and to solicit checks of $350,000 or more from supporters. According to Politico, "the Hillary Victory Fund appears to be pushing the bounds of joint fundraising in its online advertising campaign, which has included many ads urging readers to “Stop Trump” or to support Clinton." In April, a Sanders campaign lawyer sent an open letter to the DNC that alleged that "the victory fund was essentially a pass-through to allow Clinton to benefit from contributions that far exceed the amount that her campaign could legally accept."
