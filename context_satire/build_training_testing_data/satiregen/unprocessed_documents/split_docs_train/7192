After she was appointed advisor to the president, Trump donated the unpaid half of the advance payments for her book Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success to the National Urban League and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. She further said that any royalties exceeding the advances would also be given to charity.  Asian stocks and the Chinese yuan took a beating Friday after US President Donald Trump announced another round of tariffs on China. Suppliers of the Chinese tech company Huawei were hit particularly hard after Trump reignited his country's trade war with China by saying he would add a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese-made products in September â€” effectively taxing all goods from China that come into the United States. Smartphone component manufacturer Sunny Optical Technology plummeted 6%, while AAC Technologies also tumbled 5%. Q Technology lost 8%, and BYD Electronic sank 7.9%.  President Donald Trump on Friday defended recent, large-scale raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and the way the agency dealt with children of the immigrants who were detained. Asked Friday why there wasn't a better plan in place to deal with the children after their parent's arrest, Trump told reporters outside the White House south lawn, "You have to go in, you can't let anybody know." "Otherwise when you get there, nobody will be there," Trump said. "The big factor is to let people outside of the country that want to come in legally," he continued, then praising Mexico's efforts to deter migrants from illegally entering the US.
