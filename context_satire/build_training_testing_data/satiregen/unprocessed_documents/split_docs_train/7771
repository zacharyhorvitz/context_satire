Chicago formerly prohibited the sale of firearms within city limits, but on January 6, 2014, a federal judge ruled that this was unconstitutional. The judge granted the city's request for six months to pass new laws regulating gun shops. On June 25, 2014, the city council passed a new law, allowing gun stores but restricting them to certain limited areas of the city, requiring that all gun sales be videotaped, and limiting buyers to one gun per 30-day period. Store owners must make their records available to the police, and employees must be trained to identify possible straw purchasers. Illinois has a red flag law that allows family members or police to petition a judge to issue an order to confiscate the firearms of a person deemed an immediate and present danger to themselves or others. The petitioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the person poses a danger by having a firearm. The hearing for issuing the order may be done without the person being present, but the person may then request a hearing, to be held within two weeks, where they may defend themselves. If the order of confiscation is upheld, the person's guns may be taken away, and their FOID card suspended, for up to six months. In 2011, in the case of People v. Holmes, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that non-Illinois residents who are permitted to possess a firearm in their home state are not required to have an Illinois FOID card. Non-Illinois residents do not qualify to obtain a FOID card, but the FOID statute does make provisions for applicants who are employed in Illinois as law enforcement officers, armed security officers, or by the U.S. military.
