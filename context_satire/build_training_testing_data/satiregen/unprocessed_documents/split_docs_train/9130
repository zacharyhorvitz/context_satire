The School of Law of the University of Georgia (Tbilisi) is proud of the Free Legal Aid Clinic, which provides free legal advice, advocacy and membership in conducting cases in legal and administrative centers. The practice for law school students is mandatory, which shows that the development of students practical skills is important for the university and thus, appropriate environment is created. At the time of study, the student meets a real client and gives a legal consultation with the trainer-lawyer, and performs the representation in the court. In case of successful completion of the practice, the student will be able to work in the same clinic. Forensic entomology is the study of insects related to humans. There are three areas associated with forensic entomology: urban entomology, stored products entomology, and mediocriminal entomology. This list concerns only the area of mediocriminology and the schools and organizations associated with it. Mediocriminology is the interaction of the criminal justice system and the use of insects for investigations pertaining to the deaths of humans. The facilities for entomology at Texas A&M include the Heep Center, housing the Department of Entomology, the Entomology Research Laboratory, the Biological Control Facility, as well as the USDA Entomology Research Facility. The Science of Forensic Entomology course presents students with a closer look at insects as applied to forensics, with a focus on investigations, and their impact in the court of law. Applied Forensic Entomology is the corresponding lab to the previous class with hands-on application of practices involved in investigations of human and animals deaths.
