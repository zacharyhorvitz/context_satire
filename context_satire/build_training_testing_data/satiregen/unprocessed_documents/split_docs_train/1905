 Former Director of National IntelligenceÂ James Clapper called the redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report "pretty devastating" on Thursday. "The attorney general clearly is trying to paint as favorable a light on the Mueller report as possible, and when you read it, it's pretty devastating," Clapper, now a CNN national security analyst, told CNN's Chris Cuomo. Clapper said the redacted version of the findings from Mueller's nearly two-year long investigation, released by the Justice Department on Thursday, laid out "in very rich detail, the magnitude and pervasiveness of the Russian interference in our election in 2016." He said those findings were "personally gratifying, because of the intelligence community assessment that we rendered on January 6 of 2017, briefed then President-elect Trump on, about the Russian interference."  Robert Mueller's full report has yet to be released, but you can already order it online. Bookseller Barnes & Noble said Wednesday that it's offering "The Mueller Report" for pre-order to customers. The highly anticipated report, which took two years to complete and is expected to provide an in-depth look at special counsel Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, will be released publicly on Thursday. Mueller concluded his investigation nearly a month ago.  On Thursday morning, we expect Attorney General William Barr to release a redacted version of the 300+-page report compiled by special counsel Robert Mueller and aimed at examining Russian interference in the 2016 election. That release will be a BIG deal -- our first real glimpse into what the Russians were trying to do in 2016, how much (or little) the Trump campaign played along with those efforts and whether President Donald Trump (or anyone in his circle) undertook an effort to get in the way of the probe. This is, without doubt, an end. But don't fool yourself: This is not the end.
