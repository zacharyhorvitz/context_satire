Warby Parker designs its product in-house, and sell directly to consumers through its website and stores. The company orders its own materials, such as acetate, from Italy and then manufactures frames at the same Chinese factories as competitors such as Luxottica. This manufacturing process enables Warby Parker to offer lensed glasses at competitive prices. On average, a Warby Parker customer completes more than one order per year and buys an average of 1.5 units per order. In 2019, the company introduced a virtual try-on augmented reality app to show users how a pair of glasses would look on their face before purchasing. This was recognized as one of the "100 Best Inventions of 2019" by Time. The company primarily sells eyewear online and through its multiple locations throughout the United States and Canada. Warby Parker's "Home-Try-On program" is a strategy used by the company which the customers choose five frames from the website, which they receive to try on at home for five days, free of charge. The company has programs where customers upload a photo and try on frames virtually through their mobile app.
