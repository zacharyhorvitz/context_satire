Portrayed by Chad Michael Murray from season one till six, Lucas Eugene Scott is Haley's best friend and Nathan's half-brother. He and Nathan started on bad terms but later become close brothers. He is a star on the high school basketball team. He had to quit playing sports after he found out he had a genetic heart problem, inherited from his father - this meant he had more time to focus on writing. Played by Jackson Brundage since season five, James Lucas Scott, known as Jamie, is Nathan and Haley's nine-year-old son. He gets his middle name from his uncle and godfather, Lucas Scott. Brooke Davis is Jamie's godmother and they spend much of their time together, and Brooke always gives Jamie a check with "a lot of zeroes" each year on his birthday (it's Jamie's favorite present). Jamie is often a shoulder to lean on for many of the characters and is shown to be very intelligent and cute. The film opens with an infomercial, given by Dick Dupre (a parody of Don Lapre) played by John C. McGinley, which Larry (Danny Masterson) and Rico (Ronnie Warner) are watching. Larry and Rico are two stoners who live in a one-room apartment, and after watching the entire infomercial, they decide to start a "tiny classified ads" business. This is a running gag throughout the film. Each time they explain their new "business," someone asks, "Ads for what?
