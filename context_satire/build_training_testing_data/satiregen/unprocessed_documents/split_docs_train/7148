The approval of the Senate and the House of Representatives is required for a bill to become law. Both Houses must pass the same version of the bill; if there are differences, they may be resolved by a conference committee, which includes members of both bodies. For the stages through which bills pass in the Senate, see Act of Congress.  As a faction of Democrats try to deny House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi the speakership, at least one Republican may offer her a lifeline. GOP Rep. Tom Reed of New York told CNN that he could back Pelosi if she endorses a bipartisan package of rules changes that would make it easier to push legislation and weaken the power of the leadership to dictate the agenda on the House floor. "As a Republican standing here with my Democratic colleagues, I am sick and tired of this institution being controlled by essentially one office that I'm willing to take such a disruptive position as this for the American people to say look at a Democratic candidate who embraces these new reforms, I will stand with," Reed said in an interview, standing alongside three Democrats who are joining him in the effort. Asked if he would be able to withstand the backlash from Republicans by potentially backing Pelosi, Reed indicated he would. Unlike in the House of Commons, when the term committee is used to describe a stage of a bill, this committee does not take the form of a public bill committee, but what is described as Committee of the Whole House. It is made up of all Members of the House of Lords allowing any Member to contribute to debates if he or she chooses to do so and allows for more flexible rules of procedure. It is presided over by the Chairman of Committees.
