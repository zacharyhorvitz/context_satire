Jamie is invited to a pajama party with his brother by Knight, and ends up having a threesome with two girls. Jamie wakes up with a rare reaction from taking Viagra and he goes to the hospital. Some time later, Jamie goes to a restaurant and runs into Maggie, who is on a date. Bruce shows up and reveals Jamie has been promoted to the Chicago office. Prior to embarking on their crime spree neither Platt nor Matix had a criminal record. At the time of Platt's killing, his wife had no idea that her husband and friend Matix were bank robbers. In the end, he was a father to an infant son that he never met. Two days later, after he waits the night before at the bus stop in his car, he greets her back. Maggie is touched that he waited, and they resume their relationship. Jamie spends nights at Maggie's apartment. One night, he tells Maggie that he loves her—the first time he has ever said that to anyone—and has a panic attack.
