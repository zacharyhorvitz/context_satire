When he lost the Republican Party presidential primary election in 2008, Paul criticized the two major political parties, saying that there was no real difference between the parties and that neither of them truly intended to challenge the status quo. He refused to endorse the Republican Party's nominee for president, John McCain, and lent his support to third-party candidates instead.  The launch of Sen. Rand Paul's presidential campaign -- expected to be officially unveiled in Kentucky on Tuesday -- may not have been possible without the work of his father, Ron Paul, the former Texas congressman and three-time White House contender. The elder Paul, who ran for president as a Libertarian in 1988 and a Republican in 2008 and 2012, helped pave the way for Rand Paul by building a nationwide network of devoted supporters drawn to his message of limited government and non-interventionist foreign policy. But while Rand Paul has largely inherited the ideological roots of Ron Paul's political philosophy, he's not a carbon copy of his father. The two are similar in many waysâ€”Ron Paul says he agrees with 99 percent of what his son believes. Paul endorsed his son, Senator Rand Paul, in the Republican primary and campaigned for him in Iowa. After his son dropped out, Paul had said that no Republican or Democratic candidate even came close to holding Libertarian views. Paul was disappointed in the Libertarian Party for nominating Gary Johnson for President of the United States and told independent voters that Jill Stein was a better candidate for those who "lean towards progressivism and liberalism".
