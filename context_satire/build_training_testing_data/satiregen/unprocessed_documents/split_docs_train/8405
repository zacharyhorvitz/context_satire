Rumours of new songs from Carroll started to surface in the summer of 1995, but instead of releasing them, she found herself in the midst of contractual problems. Howard Berman, who had originally signed her to A&M, had moved to Mercury Records but there were problems in convincing them to move Carroll with him. Eventually, Mercury agreed but it was not until May 1996 that the release of a new single was confirmed. "Escaping", a song written by Barry Blue, first recorded by New Zealander Margaret Urlich in 1989 and subsequently a minor hit for Asia Blue in 1992, was finally released in September, almost three years after Carroll's last record. The most memorable event of the night was when Stan Berman, a New York City cabdriver, awarded Bob Hope a homemade Oscar after he had slipped through security and made his way to the stage. Both Jackie Gleason (in "The Hustler") and Judy Garland (in "Judgment At Nuremberg") were heavily favored to win the awards for best supporting actor and actress. However, they were defeated by George Chakiris and Rita Moreno as part of the "West Side Story" sweep. The musical film wound up winning a total of ten Academy Awards including Best Picture. The new album, Dina Carroll, was originally planned for release at the end of 1998, including her cover of the Dusty Springfield song, "Son of a Preacher Man".
