The highlight of ESPN's coverage of this draft was a verbal altercation between ESPN draft expert Mel Kiper, Jr. and Indianapolis Colts' GM Bill Tobin. While disputing the Colts pick of linebacker Trev Alberts of Nebraska (when Kiper felt a quarterback such as Trent Dilfer made more sense), Tobin famously said to the ESPN crew "Who in the hell is Mel Kiper, anyway? I mean, here's a guy who criticizes everybody, whoever they take. In my knowledge of him, he's never even put on a jockstrap, he's never been a player, he's never been a coach, he's never been a scout, he's never been an administrator, and all of a sudden, he's an expert. Kiper said that Ernie Accorsi, general manager of the then-Baltimore Colts, encouraged him to become a draft analyst. Accorsi told him that there was a market for draft information and suggested that Kiper convert his analysis into a business. The game features a franchise mode with a SportsCenter feature hosted by Chris Berman. He outlines the games of the current week with his co-host Trey Wingo who talks about the latest injuries and free agent deals and trades during the season. Mel Kiper Jr. hosts the draft portion of the segment while Suzy Kolber reports from the sidelines. There is also weekly preparation for the coming week which allows the player to make decisions on training and preparation.
