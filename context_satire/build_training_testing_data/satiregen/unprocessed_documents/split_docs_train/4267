Sullivan had been seriously visually impaired for almost all of her life, but by 1935, she was completely blind in both eyes. On October 15, 1936, she had a coronary thrombosis, fell into a coma, and died five days later, on October 20, at age 70 in Forest Hills, with Keller holding her hand. Keller described Sullivan's last month as being very agitated, but during the last week, she was said to return to her normal generous self. Sullivan was cremated and her ashes interred in a memorial at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. She was the first woman to be recognized for her achievements in this way. The summer following Sullivan's graduation, the director of Perkins, Michael Anagnos, was contacted by Arthur Keller, who was in search of a teacher for his seven-year-old blind and deaf daughter, Helen. Anagnos immediately recommended Sullivan for this position, and she began her work on March 3, 1887, at the Kellers' home in Tuscumbia, Alabama. As soon as she arrived there, she argued with Helen's parents about the Civil War and over the fact that they used to own slaves. However, she also quickly connected with Helen. Her second husband was millionaire Victor Rothschild of the Rothschild family. They were married from 1954 to 1966, when they divorced. While married to Rothschild, she gave birth to a daughter, Victoria Ellen, who died in 1963 at three months of age from SIDS. Following the death of her only child, she withdrew from public life.
