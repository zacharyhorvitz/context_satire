In October, a clown was arrested after threatening kids on their way to school in Whitehall, Allegheny County. On October 3, 2016, the Pennsylvania State Police issued a "Community Awareness Bulletin" which specifically addressed the reports that have been appearing in news and social media around the country. The general tone of the bulletin was cautionary, yet at the same time it reinforced the notion that many of the threats specific to clowns attacking schools had "not been validated". The bulletin also recalls the 1980s clown sightings in various US cities, as well as providing a phone number, email address and information about a smartphone app that citizens can use to report suspicious behavior to authorities. On October 16, 2016 just outside the city limits of Pryor, Oklahoma a female motorist was reportedly attacked by two clowns after being flagged down by a woman posing as a motorist in need of assistance. She said the clowns forcibly dragged the motorist from her vehicle, choked her, extinguished a cigarette on her face, and wrote the words "clown posse" on her forehead. She later confessed to having made up the story and said she was responsible for her injuries. Numerous Floridian schools were also put under lock down due to the scare. Additionally, threats arose on social media from people masquerading as clowns, where they threaten to cause a school shooting. One of these "killer clowns" was discovered to be a 12-year-old boy, who said he was going to kill students at Pasco County schools and was subsequently arrested.
