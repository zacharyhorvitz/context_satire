He was less than happy when an amazed McQueen discovered his past and asked, "How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?" Doc admitted that he did not quit, but was forced into retirement after his crash by the rise of hot young racers. "I had a lot of stuff left," Doc said sadly, "but I never got the chance to show it." After McQueen finished fixing the Radiator Springs road that he damaged when arriving in town as part of Doc's court ruling, McQueen decided to stay in town for a while, but Doc was unable to bear having him around any longer and called the news and press, prompting McQueen to immediately leave for the Piston Cup championship race in California. Doc Hudson does not appear in Cars 2 as his voice actor Paul Newman died from lung cancer in September 2008. Pixar decided having Doc appear in Cars 2 would not be a good idea. A conversation between McQueen and Mater indicates that Doc died before the second film. Doc's memory lives on, as the Piston Cup was renamed after him. Tom Hudson (July 3, 1922 – December 27, 1997) was a United Kingdom 1922–1997 British artist and lecturer. He created sculptures using modern materials such as perspex and resin and considered that Art could be a means of changing society. His greatest influence was on Art teaching. He was a foremost proponent of the Bauhaus concept of teaching Art and Design by Basic Design, taking that principle to Art Colleges across the UK in the 1950s, 60s and 70s.
