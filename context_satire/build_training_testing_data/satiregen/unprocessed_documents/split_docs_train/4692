 The greatest things in the world can often disguise themselves as the worst things in the world. Which is why, as Colts Quarterback Andrew Luck walked off the field at Lucas Oil Stadium on Saturday night, he was presented with a gift cloaked as a turd. Moments earlier, Luck -- dressed in a gray T-shirt and shorts and out with a lingering left calf and ankle injury -- was watching from the sidelines during the Bears-Colts pre-season clash when ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that the 29-year-old would be retiring. The news was shocking.  As word spread Saturday night that Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck is retiring, some fans booed the four-time Pro Bowler after a preseason game against the Chicago Bears. But Luck received support from teammates and other NFL players, coaches and owners, who know firsthand the extent of the mental and physical toll a pro football career can bring. "Andrew Luck will be somebody I tell my kids about. The person & the player.  Quarterback Andrew Luck, the first pick in the 2012 NFL draft and a four-time Pro Bowl selection, announced on Saturday night that he's retiring. "This is not an easy decision," the Indianapolis Colts player told reporters. "For the last four years or so I've been in this cycle of injury, pain, rehab, injury, pain, rehab. And it's been unceasing and unrelenting ... and the only way I see out is to no longer play football."
