 Every explosion in Gaza seems personal to Said Durrah. The Washington-area resident has so many relatives in Gaza that he can't count them all: uncles, aunts, cousins, second cousins, and so on, in Zaytoon, Rimal and other Gaza communities. His mother is one of nine children, many of whom still live in the Palestinian territory. "Every missile hits close to home, pardon the pun," he said.  New numbers from the Census Bureau show that in 2011 just over 16% of Americans -- nearly 50 million people -- were living below the poverty line. But a new report from the "Half in Ten" Campaign, which aims to cut the U.S. poverty in half over the next decade, claims the answer to poverty goes hand in hand with solutions to fix our economy. Los Angeles Democratic Mayor Anthony Villaraigosa, who will be presenting this report at an event in Washington D.C. today, explains why a solid economy is key to lifting Americans out of poverty. Black Friday is an informal name for the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the United States, which is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. The day after Thanksgiving has been regarded as the beginning of the United States Christmas shopping season since 1952, although the term "Black Friday" did not become widely used until more recent decades. Many stores offer highly promoted sales on Black Friday and open very early, such as at midnight, or may even start their sales at some time on Thanksgiving. Black Friday is not an official holiday, but California and some other states observe "The Day After Thanksgiving" as a holiday for state government employees, sometimes in lieu of another federal holiday, such as Columbus Day.
