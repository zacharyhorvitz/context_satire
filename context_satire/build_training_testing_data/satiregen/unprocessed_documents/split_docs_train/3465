Violinist Yehudi Menuhin said of a Gopalakrishnan's playing: "I have not heard such violin in all my travels! How superbly this young Indian is playing our instrument". Shri Gopalakrishnan said when he was receiving his Sangita Kalanidhi award from the Music Academy of Madras "My practice is the only secret of my success and then the other secret is my father. The practice what I was used to was nearly 15-16 hours a day and that was a very tough one where I used to jump suddenly from Carnatic to Hindustani styles while playing. Jothi did not want to marry him: she found him not-good-looking and not educated enough, above all else, she was afraid of him. So Surya tried to change his look and his behaviour. The two eventually got engaged with the blessings of their family. Later, Surya who became an overprotective fianc√© suspected her college mate Kishore of wooing Jothi and he beat him up. The President of India, Pratibha Patil lamented the passing away of the actor. In a press release she said "I am saddened to learn about the passing away of Rajesh Khanna. In his prime as an actor he was the heartthrob of the young generation of 1970s, who tried to model themselves on him and his style."
