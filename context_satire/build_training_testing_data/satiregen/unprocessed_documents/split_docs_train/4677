"Occupational health should aim at: the promotion and maintenance of the highest degree of physical, mental and social well-being of workers in all occupations; the prevention amongst workers of departures from health caused by their working conditions; the protection of workers in their employment from risks resulting from factors adverse to health; the placing and maintenance of the worker in an occupational environment adapted to his physiological and psychological capabilities; and, to summarize, the adaptation of work to man and of each man to his job.  Former President Jimmy Carter was discharged from a Winnipeg hospital Friday morning after becoming dehydrated while working on a Habitat for Humanity project, the Carter Center said. The 92-year-old former president and former first lady Rosalynn Carter returned to the Habitat for Humanity build site, where they attended the morning devotional. Habitat for Humanity CEO Jonathan Reckford said in a statement Thursday that Carter grew dehydrated after "working in the hot sun." Upon their return Friday, Reckford tweeted, the 39th President received a "huge ovation." The research and regulation of occupational safety and health are a relatively recent phenomenon. As labor movements arose in response to worker concerns in the wake of the industrial revolution, worker's health entered consideration as a labor-related issue.
