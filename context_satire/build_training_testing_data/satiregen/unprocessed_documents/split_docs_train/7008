The Parsons table was designed by Jean-Michel Frank while he was working at Parsons Paris, then known as the Paris Atelier. While the form is generally credited to Parsons School of Design in New York City, according to an article in The New York Times that referred to archives at Parsons School, the table was developed out of a course taught at Parsons Paris by the French designer Jean-Michel Frank in the 1930s. The New York Times has described the new Paris campus as "both the oldest and newest overseas branch of an American university". In 1921, Frank Alvah Parsons opened the Paris Ateliers of the New York School of Fine and Applied Art (which was renamed Parsons School of Design after its director in 1941). The following year, the school made its home on the oldest planned square in Paris, the Place des Vosges. Parsons stated: "France, more than any country, has been the center of artistic inspiration since the sixteenth centuryâ€¦ The value of associating with, and working from, the finest examples of the periods in decorative art, the adaptation of which is our national problem, needs no comment." In 1904, Frank Alvah Parsons joined artist Robert Henri as a teacher at the school. In the same approximate time frame, Parsons studied for two years with the vanguard artist and educator, Arthur Wesley Dow at Columbia University graduating in 1905 with a degree in fine arts. A few years later, he became president of The New York School of Art. Anticipating a new wave of the Industrial Revolution, Parsons predicted that art and design would soon be inexorably linked to the engines of industry.
