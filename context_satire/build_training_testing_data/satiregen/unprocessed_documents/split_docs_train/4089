For now, Elizabeth is in a certain kind of limbo, where she is supposed to explain what she believes in, so that she could pass through the gate. She is supposed to do it in front of the court. Her first attempt is a complete failure, for she says the truth and claims that she doesn't believe in anything. She has another try, but the novel ends before she finds out whether she is going to pass through the gate or not. None of the show's other running gags was as memorable or enduring as the hall closet (so popular, in fact, that PBS's Zoboomafoo kept the joke alive). The gag involved McGee's frequently opening a cacophonous closet, with the bric-a-brac it contained clattering down and out and, often enough, over McGee's or Molly's heads. "I gotta get that closet cleaned out one of these days" was the usual McGee observation once the racket subsided. Naturally, "one of these days" almost never arrived. Not only the does the public not understand what she wants them to realize, but neither does her own family. Elizabeth's vegetarianism often provokes quarrels between her and her daughter-in-law. Her son is torn between love for his mother and difficulties in accepting her point of view. More often than not, he asks himself why she can't be just like any other elderly woman.
