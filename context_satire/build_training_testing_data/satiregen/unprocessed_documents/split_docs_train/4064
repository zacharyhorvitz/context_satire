Shirley Schmidt is a named partner of Crane, Poole & Schmidt, a firm she founded with partners Denny Crane and Edwin Poole. With a propensity to remind her younger colleagues that she's "Schmidt", Shirley is tasked with reining in Denny's preposterous behavior, directing litigation, and practicing law. Prior to founding her firm, Shirley attended Wellesley College where she met her share of intelligent Harvard students. She spent a significant amount of time in New York, before being called to Boston by Paul Lewiston. At the time, Ingraham said that it boiled down to a matter of trust.

And he maintained that the FNM had developed an agenda to renew the people's trust in government.
