His technique is awesome! Even today, nobody has really come to the state that he was playing at. As good as players are, they haven't gotten to where he is. There's a lot of guys that play fast and a lot of guys that play clean, and the guitar has come a long way as far as speed and clarity go, but nobody plays with the whole fullness of expression that Django has. A number of authors have repeated the claim that Reinhardt's nickname, Django, is Romani for "I awake";:4â€“5 however, it may also simply have been a diminutive, or local Walloon version, of "Jean". Reinhardt spent most of his youth in Romani encampments close to Paris, where he started playing the violin, banjo and guitar. He became adept at stealing chickens, which was viewed as a noble skill by the Romani, because part of their means of survival on the road was to steal from the non-Romani world around them. :5:14 His father reportedly played music in a family band comprising himself and seven brothers; a surviving photograph shows this band including his father on piano. Eric generally doesn't collect guitars as he isn't interested in owning a lot of superfluous items. His collection is small and limited to the best playing examples of the guitar he finds.
