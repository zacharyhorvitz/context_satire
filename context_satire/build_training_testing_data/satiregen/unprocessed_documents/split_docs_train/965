In 1936, Toyota entered the passenger car market with its Model AA and held a competition to establish a new logo emphasizing speed for its new product line. After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to "Toyota" from the family name "Toyoda". The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo is no longer found on its vehicles but remains the corporate emblem used in Japan. During late 2009, Toyota issued a recall on 2000-2003 model year Tundras regarding rust problems of a rear crossmember. This recall involved 110,000 vehicles and followed a similar action for the Tacoma. Following the Tacoma voluntary recall Tundra owners began complaining of rust issues. In some cases, trucks were inspected by dealers and found to be unsafe to drive. In addition, Toyota announced that is backing away from fully electric vehicles. The company's vice chairman, Takeshi Uchiyamada, said: "The current capabilities of electric vehicles do not meet societyâ€™s needs, whether it may be the distance the cars can run, or the costs, or how it takes a long time to charge." Toyota's emphasis would be re-focused on the hybrid concept, and 21 new hybrid gas-electric models scheduled to be on the market by 2015.
