 It will be remembered as one of the most awkward scenes of an administration replete with them. Two Cabinet members of the Jewish faith standing at President Donald Trump's side as he drew a moral equivalence between the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who rallied in Charlottesville and those who came to protest their hate-filled message. Standing to the President's right, National Economic Council director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin looked stricken. They had shown up for a press conference on infrastructure, only to be cast as supporting actors in a bizarre and distasteful scene. It was bound to be a rocky period with Richard Nixon as President, given the fact that he held the Agency responsible for his defeat in 1960. ... He would constantly, in N.S.C. meetings, pick on the Agency for not having properly judged what the Soviets were going to do ..." Helms concludes: "Dealing with him was tough, it seems to me that the fact that I ended up with my head on my shoulders after four years of working with him is not the least achievement of my life" (at 10). And I think at that time he'd made up his mind that it would be a good idea to tie intelligence into the inner circle of his policy-making and decision-making process. So starting from that time he began to invite me to the Tuesday lunches, and I remained a member of that group until the end of his administration.
