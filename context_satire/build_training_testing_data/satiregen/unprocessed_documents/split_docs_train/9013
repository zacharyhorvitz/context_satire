Minghella happened to see the dailies from a film his wife Caroline Choa was producing at the time, The Wisdom of Crocodiles (1998), starring Jude Law. The director was impressed with Law's performance and offered him the role of Dickie; in his "insane arrogance", as Law put it, he initially refused, because he did not wish to play a "pretty boy". After learning of the cast Minghella was assembling and coming to understand that he would be "in safe hands" with the director, Law later accepted the part. The film's production coincided with the start of the Me Too movement, causing a resurgence in public interest in the 1992 sexual assault allegation against Allen. In October 2017, actor Newman announced via Twitter that he regretted acting in the film and would not work with Allen again in the future. Newman donated his salary to RAINN. In January 2018, Chalamet donated his salary to RAINN, Time's Up and the LGBT Center of New York. In 2006, he portrayed the role of Kate Winslet's character's single-parent brother in the film The Holiday, a modern-day American romantic comedy written, produced and directed by Nancy Meyers. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law said he found it tricky to approach the contemporary role in this film. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation. By the end of the year, Law was one of the Top Ten A-list of the most bankable film stars in Hollywood, according to the Ulmer Scale.
