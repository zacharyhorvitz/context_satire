 John Schnatter, the founder and public face of Papa John's pizza, resigned as the company's chairman hours after he apologized for using the N-word on a conference call in May. Papa John's said in a statement late Wednesday it would appoint a new chairman "in the coming weeks." Schnatter had apologized earlier in the day after Forbes reported that he used the racial slur while participating in a role-playing exercise designed to prevent public relations crises. According to the account in Forbes, Schnatter was on a call with Laundry Service, a marketing agency, and was asked how he planned to manage future public relations flare-ups.  Papa John's is moving on without Papa John. Does that mean that a takeover of the struggling pizza chain could soon be on the menu? Shares of Papa John's soared 11% last week after the company announced that founder John Schnatter was stepping down as chairman. He resigned after it was reported that he used a derogatory racial slur in a conference call with a marketing firm, and investors seemed to cheer his exit.  Papa John's founder is physically out at the pizza chain. A special committee of the board of directors met on Sunday to discuss its founder John Schnatter, who resigned his chairmanship last week after making racist comments. The board decided to kick him out of his office at Papa John's headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky. Papa John's also announced that Schnatter will "cease all media appearances, and not make any further statements to the media regarding the company, its business or employees," the company said in a statement.
