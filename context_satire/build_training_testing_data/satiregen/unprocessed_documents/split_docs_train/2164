On 29 June 2006 during a session of the Committee on Armed Services, General Wayne Downing testified before the U.S. House of Representatives that 70 percent of all Delta operators had served in the 75th Ranger Regiment. General Downing also testified that while some are directly recruited into Delta Force, others spend time in Army Special Forces before transitioning into Delta Force. As part of the re-branding project, a safety video featuring a flight attendant showed up on YouTube in early 2008, getting over 1 million views and the attention of news outlets, specifically for the video's tone mixed with the serious safety message. The flight attendant, Katherine Lee, was dubbed "Deltalina" by a member of FlyerTalk for her resemblance to Angelina Jolie. Delta had considered several styles for its current safety video, including animation, before opting for a video presenting a flight attendant speaking to the audience. The video was filmed on a former Song Airlines Boeing 757-200. At Florida A&M University in 2013, it was anonymously reported a Delta pledge lost consciousness one night after being forced to do squats for a long period of time. Women pledging were physically and verbally punished if any forgot information they were asked to remember about each of their 54 "line sisters." Members of the sorority initially denied all hazing allegations but a thorough investigation led to the sorority being placed on suspension until at least June 2016 and the 2013 pledge line was dropped.
