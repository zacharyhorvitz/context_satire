Jimmy tries to make amends with Chuck in the season finale, "Lantern", but Chuck coldly cuts ties with Jimmy, telling him that "he never really mattered all that much to him". After Chuck forces Jimmy away, his EHS symptoms begin to re-emerge, and he becomes obsessed with disabling all electronic devices in his home to the point of tearing walls open to remove the wiring. He eventually reaches a breaking point and knocks a gas lantern over, setting fire to his house. After this scene, there was much speculation as to what happened to Chuck after the fire started. The APD detectives' investigation of Gale's apartment yields Gus's fingerprint, which gives the APD and the DEA probable cause to officially request that Fring come in for questioning. Fring complies and then explains his ties to Boetticher, who won one of Gus's Maximino Arciniega scholarships that Gale used to pursue degrees in chemistry. Roberts is satisfied with Gus's explanations of how he knew Boetticher and why he was in Boetticher's home, but Hank remains dubious and continues investigating Fring and his personal and business dealings. The Cousins quickly tracked Walter to his house and were waiting inside to kill him when Mike informed Victor of their presence. Victor told Gus, who contacted the cartel. The Cousins then received a text message telling them to abort, so they left without Walter knowing they had been there. Although Gus gave them permission to kill Walter after Gus's partnership with him ended three months later, Gus was warned that the Cousins would probably ignore the arrangement.
