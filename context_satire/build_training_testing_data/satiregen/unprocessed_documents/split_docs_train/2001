 With a new book to promote, Hillary Clinton is preparing to re-enter the public eye. Her first stop: a sit-down with Jane Pauley on "CBS Sunday Morning" this coming weekend. It will be Clinton's first television interview since the 2016 presidential campaign, and the first interview about her memoir, "What Happened," a retrospective on her failed White House bid that will officially hit shelves next week.

Following the result, after rumors fueled by a misunderstanding of an Associated Press report, the campaign dismissed suggestions that Clinton was going to concede in the speech following the primaries. In her speech after the closing of the Montana polls, Clinton said "I will be making no decisions tonight." She invited Americans to write to her on her website to provide input into what her next steps should be.  The publisher of a book by Hillary Clinton's longtime pastor is discontinuing sales of the book and destroying remaining copies, saying that it found examples of plagiarism beyond those reported by CNN last month. "Strong for a Moment Like This: The Daily Devotions of Hillary Rodham Clinton," is based on emails that the Rev. Bill Shillady, a United Methodist minister, wrote to Clinton from April 2015 through December of last year. Shillady described his emails as a way to minister to a candidate in perpetual motion.
