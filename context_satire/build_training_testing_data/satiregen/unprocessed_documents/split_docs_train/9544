As a sniper, Kyle was often asked about his weapons. While in training, he used four different rifles in order to know which weapon was the most useful in the given situation. In the field, he used the following: In December 2008, after not making an appearance for Vale in three months, Perry made it clear his intentions were to earn a spot in the first team and brushed off rumours that he would follow Chris Slater back into non-league football. However, by February 2009, he was informed that he would not be offered a new contract in the summer. Kyle was arguably one of the United States military's most effective snipers in Iraq with a large number of confirmed and unconfirmed kills. To be counted as confirmed, "They basically had to see the person fall and be clearly dead", according to Jim DeFelice, one of the coauthors of Kyle's autobiography. Kyle's shooter's statements (shooter's statements are filled out by every sniper after a mission) were reported to higher command, who kept them in case any shootings were contested as outside the rules of engagement (ROE). The publisher HarperCollins states: "The Pentagon has officially confirmed more than 150 of Kyle's kills (the previous American record was 109), but it has declined to verify the total number for this book."
