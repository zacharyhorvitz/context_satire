 "Here's a resident of Aleppo, Gov. Johnson. His name is Omran Daqneesh." These words, delivered directly to the former elected head of New Mexico, served to echo the sentiments of countless critics questioning Gary Johnson's foreign policy credentials.  Ever since former Politico CEO Jim VandeHei left the company last April, he's been teasing the launch of a new digital media company. Now, that company has investors -- including NBCUniversal, which has put money into several digital media properties, and Lerer Hippeau Ventures, whose managing partner, Ken Lerer, co-founded the Huffington Post and is chairman of BuzzFeed. VandeHei's new project has raised $10 million from NBCU, Lerer and others in what amounts to a Series A funding round for the venture, which is slated to launch in early 2017, sources familiar with the investment told CNNMoney on Tuesday. NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack and Lerer Hippeau managing partner Eric Hippeau will sit on the company's board, the sources said.  Navy vet Connie Willhite, cancer-stricken and dying, had just two small requests. He wanted to be baptized to ensure he'd cross over to the next life in accordance with his religious beliefs. And he wanted to go on one more fishing trip. The baptism wasn't a problem.
