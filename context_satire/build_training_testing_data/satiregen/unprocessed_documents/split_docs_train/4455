In 1955, the animated film Lady and the Tramp inspired a new comic strip based on an adorable, unnamed puppy glimpsed at the end of the movie. Scamp debuted in newspapers on October 31, 1955, and ran for more than 30 years, ending on June 25, 1988. The strip was created by Ward Greene, a King Features Syndicate editor who wrote the original magazine story, Happy Dan, the Whistling Dog, and Miss Patsy, the Beautiful Spaniel, which inspired the film. Greene and artist Dick Moores produced the strip for eight months as a continuing story. George Sherman, head of Disney's Publications Department at the time, hired Tom Golberg to run the program. Sherman noted the purpose of the program was "We  use new characters in our foreign comics, characters that we don't have .... to bring out facets of existing characters,  give the stories more variety." The Sunday Mickey Mouse strip started on January 10, 1932 with a topper Silly Symphony strip.Silly Symphony initially related the adventures of Bucky Bug, the first Disney character to originate in the comics. It went on to print more adaptations of Silly Symphony shorts, often using the characters and setting of the original shorts, but adding new plotlines and incidents. It also went on to print adaptations of the feature films, as well as periods of gag strips featuring Donald Duck and Pluto. By late 1935 the strip was a standalone half-page, not strictly a topper for the Mickey Sunday.
