The railway originally had three locomotives, Wee Georgie Wood, Wee Mary and a Krauss engine named "Puppy". Wee Mary was never restored and its chassis is currently in the Ida Bay/Lune River area. Prior to working in Tullah, Puppy worked in the Duck River region of the state and was eventually bought by the North Mt Farrell Co. The name "Puppy" was given due to its high pitched whistle, but it was originally Krauss number 2640 of 1892. The troublesome daughter of an American millionaire accompanies him aboard his yacht on a deep sea diving expedition in the Red Sea and falls in love with the captain. For the release of the film Loren, who had up to this point acted as Sofia Lazzaro, adopted her new screen name by which she became famous. This was partly in imitation of the then better-known Swedish actress Märta Torén. Loren learned to swim for the role, and spent much of her screen time in a bathing suit. This led one critic to worry that she was being turned into an Italian Esther Williams.
