 Taron Egerton, the 29-year-old British actor who gained notoriety in films like "The Smoke" and the "Kingsman" franchise, has taken on the role of a lifetime playing music icon Elton John in the biopic, "Rocketman." When speaking to CNN at the film's New York premiere, the Egerton reflected his preparation for the role and what he learned about the 5-time Grammy winner. The movie highlights Elton John's tough childhood and addiction to drugs and alcohol. How much did you know about his upbringing before you took on the role?  "Taron Egerton is Elton John," say the billboards for "Rocketman," and that's not hyperbole. Egerton's electric performance as the famed rock star drives this jukebox musical, which imaginatively uses John's rich trove of songs to tell his story, in a way that produces some genuinely beautiful moments but also at times dilutes the drama. Although "Rocketman" (which can thank Donald Trump's Kim Jong Un nickname for extra promotion) will evoke inevitable comparisons to "Bohemian Rhapsody" -- basically charting the rise to fame, coming to grips with being gay in the 1970s, and rock-star-sized problems -- it's a very different construct, and not merely because it leans more unflinchingly into that material. (To his credit, John balked at toning down the sex and drugs that go with the rock 'n roll.)  The new film "Booksmart" has some major boosters. Several stars, including Taylor Swift, Ryan Reynolds and Natalie Portman, have been using social media to encourage folks to see the movie that marks the directorial debut for actress Olivia Wilde. The movie follows two high school students who try to cram in all the fun they missed while they were busy studying. Swift reposted a story on Instagram from one of the film's cast members, Diana Silvers, which showed Silvers changing the words to Swift's hit "Delicate," urging people to see her movie.
