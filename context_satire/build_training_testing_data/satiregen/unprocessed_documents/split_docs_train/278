 Two 19-year-old Americans have been arrested while on vacation in Rome over the murder of an Italian police officer Friday, Italian police told CNN on Saturday. The Carabinieri police force said in a statement that the pair were arrested Friday night for "the crime of aggravated murder and attempted extortion." Police named the suspects as Christian Gabriel Natale Hjorth and Finnegan Lee Elder, and said both were from San Francisco. Photos of the pair have not been released.  Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's presidential campaign sued Google on Thursday after the company suspended the candidate's Google Ads account following last month's Democratic presidential debate. The campaign alleges the corporation "used its control over online political speech to silence" the candidate. The campaign said its inability to run Google Ads meant it lost out on campaign donations it could have received if users were directed to the candidate's website. After the first Democratic debate last month, Google released data that showed the Hawaii representative was the most searched candidate during the first debate.  President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that African Americans are so delighted with his attacks on the city of Baltimore and US congressman Elijah Cummings, an African American, that they are calling him at the White House in large numbers to thank him. He also claimed that African Americans are generally happy with his performance as president. "What I've done for African Americans, no president, I would say, has done. Now, I'll say this: they are so happy, because I get the calls," he told reporters as he left for a speech in Virginia that was boycotted by black state lawmakers.
