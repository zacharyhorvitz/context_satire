Kitt Peak is the second-highest peak on the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation, and as such is the second-most sacred after Baboquivari Peak. Near the summit is I'itoi's Garden, the summer residence of the nation's elder brother deity. The name Ioligam means "red stick" in reference to the abundance of manzanita bushes on and around the mountain. This mountain is regarded by the O'odham nation as the navel of the world â€” a place where the earth opened and the people emerged after the great flood. Baboquivari Peak is also sometimes referred to as I'Itoi Mountain. In the native O'odham language, it is referred to as Waw Kiwulik, meaning "narrow about the middle". The O'odham people believe that he watches over their people to this day. The telescope was dedicated in the summer of 1973, at which time it was the second largest telescope by aperture in the world. The telescope was named after Mayall who was the director of Kitt Peak National Observatory (of the United States) for over a decade.
