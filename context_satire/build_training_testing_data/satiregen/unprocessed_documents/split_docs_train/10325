Lance Byrne is played by Ian McElhinney. Lance has lived in Redwater all his life. McElhinney described Lance as a "patriarch" but "quite weak" while his wife, Agnes, "rules the roost", and "he's quite happy to be a character in the town with the kind of respect that comes from having been around for quite a while being the 'grand old man' of the village." He enjoys riding his horse, swimming, drinking and " out with pieces of wisdom". Dolan was born at the County Hospital, now known as the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, County Westmeath on 16 October 1939, the youngest of eight children in a Roman Catholic family. He was orphaned at a young age – his father, a bicycle shop proprietor, died when Joe was eight; his mother when he was fifteen. He sang in school, and his mother had encouraged him to take up the piano. He made his first stage appearance at a talent show held in a marquee on the Fair Green in his native Mullingar. In episode 1, it is revealed that his wife, Iris, who died in a boating accident, lost a child in London and took Kathleen's child and brought him back to Ireland as her own, and Peter is unaware that Dermott is not his son.
