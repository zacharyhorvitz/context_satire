Edmonton is the most left wing area of Alberta, but this doesn't say much. Much like the rest of Alberta, Edmonton usually always votes for the leading right wing party of the day. This is the one area of Alberta where the Liberals have been able to win anything in recent years, winning two seats in both 1997 and 2000, and four seats in 1993. The NDP have also won a seat in Edmonton, doing so in 1988. Winnipeg has traditionally been a three-way race between the NDP, the Conservatives and the Liberals. That ended in 1993, and since then nor the Progressive Conservatives or the Alliance/Reform Party have been able to win a seat here. Now that they are merged, their prospects look good to return Winnipeg once again into a three-way race.  Ontario was predicted to be the battle ground of this election. Most pundits believed that this is where the election was lost for the Conservatives. Ontario is home to more than one third of all of Canada's ridings. In the last three elections, right wing vote splitting has resulted in just six riding losses for the Liberals, compared to 299 riding wins.
