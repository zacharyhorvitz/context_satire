In 2004, the vessel was transferred to P&O Cruises Australia and renamed Pacific Sun. Pacific Sun arrived in Australia in 9 November 2004, and began year-round cruises from Sydney to the South Pacific and Tropical North Queensland. From late 2007, she was based at Brisbane, and was then the largest year-round liner to be based in Queensland. After receiving a multimillion-dollar makeover, she sailed in all white colours, like P&O's other ships, along with new amenities.  Reverend Esther was on a mission. She wanted to help craft a world where, as her church put it, "only God is God." Only then would Earth be ready for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, she said on her website. Esther, whose legal name in South Korea is Shin Ok-ju, predicted there was a great famine and believed she and her followers needed to find a new home. In May 2015, Metro Newspapers acquired the Pacific Sun, increasing its portfolio to four Bay Area alternative weeklies. Metro restored circulation cuts that had occurred under the previous ownership and commissioned well-known typographer Jim Parkinson to redraw the Sun's nameplate. Owner Dan Pulcrano promised “investment and creative vision... to produce a free weekly that’s fresh, original and true to its history.”
