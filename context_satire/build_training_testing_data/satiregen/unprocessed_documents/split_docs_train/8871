 A grid failure cut power supplies in northern India on Monday, hitting rail and road transport for hours in the country's worst blackout in a decade, authorities said. The outage held up at least 300 trains in the region, Indian railway spokesman Anil Kumar Saxena told CNN. India's Power System Corporation Limited reported the collapse at 2.35 a.m. local time. Officials say it affected seven states in northern India, home to more than 350 million people.  Crews restored full power to northern India on Wednesday as officials continued to search for the cause of the country's worst blackout in at least a decade. Half the country lost power Tuesday after three electricity grids failed, leaving an estimated 600 million people -- more than the population of the United States, Mexico and Canada combined --  sweating in the stifling summer heat. The grids were meeting 100% of demand Wednesday morning, the Power Grid Corporation of India said on its website. The blackout, the second in as many days, brought trains and traffic on roads to a standstill, while businesses closed and millions of residents sweltered without air conditioning in the summer heat.  India suffered widespread power outages that plunged half the nation in darkness Tuesday, the second massive power failure in as many days. As many as 600 million people were hit by the blackout, disrupting transportation and business before power returned. The breakdown of the nation's power grid points to another global concern: The slowdown of developing economies. After the 2008-2009 financial crisis, growth of developing economies like India and China that pulled the world out of recession -- the first time a return to growth from a global recession wasn't led by the developed economies like the U.S., Japan and Europe.
