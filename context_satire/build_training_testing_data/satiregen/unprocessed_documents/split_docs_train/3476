Bond was born in the village of Liss, Hampshire, England. He was the first born child of his parents. He was born into a family whereby the army was the destined career for any family member, with his father and numerous uncles being in the army. As a result, it was always assumed that he would follow in this tradition and was frequently persuaded by his family that this was his career path. In 1970, at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park, he played Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing, and as Lord Byron in the one man show - Lord Byron. Agent, David Graham, mentions in his book 'Casting About: a Memoir' that "Had it been within my power to choose, Gary Bond would have become my life’s companion. When ‘Chips With Everything’ was brought to New York , he was among the original British cast that came with it. Ashley-Steiner had been asked by his agent to represent him, and I was the lucky bloke assigned to look after him. Young blonde and handsome he struck me as the most beautiful man I had ever seen.
