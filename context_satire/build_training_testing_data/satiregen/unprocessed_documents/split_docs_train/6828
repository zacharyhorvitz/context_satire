Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times wrote that the movie "went wrong" much of it due to Charles Randolph’s "cutesy screenplay ... which unfolds at a cartoony pace more suitable to a dark comedy." Megyn Kelly felt the film "took liberties" with her story and specifically denied that she told Murdoch the question she was going to ask Donald Trump in advance of the debate or that Ailes liked the question. "The notion that Roger liked the Donald Trump 'woman' question because it created controversy and a TV moment was not true. Roger did not like the question — at all — and was very angry at me for asking it. With the Eels making it clear that they preferred Luke Burt ahead of the off-contract McKinnon, McKinnon often found it tough to make the first-grade team when the Eels were at full-strength.

McKinnon cited the Warriors' style of play as being conducive to the game. Ma came together as a result of Tate Taylor's desire to direct a film about "something fucked up," and a conversation he had with Octavia Spencer in which she told him that she was "sick of only being offered the same role and never getting to be a lead." The two are longtime friends, having worked together in films such as The Help and Get on Up. Jason Blum and Taylor, who have been friends for a few years, knew each other socially.
