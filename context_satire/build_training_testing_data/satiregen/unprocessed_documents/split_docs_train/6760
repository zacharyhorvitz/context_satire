 Secretary of Labor Washington, D.C. 20210 July 12, 2019 President Donald J. Trump The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, D.C. Dear Mr. President: My parents left Cuba as refugees in search of freedom to make a better life in the greatest country in the world, the United States of America. They worked hard and wanted the best opportunities for their son and grandchildren. In one generation, their dreams were more than surpassed when you offered me the honor of a lifetime to serve as a member of your Cabinet, as Secretary of Labor. From our first meeting, you offered me the opportunity to move consequential work forward on behalf of the American workforce.  President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he will nominate Gene Scalia, former Justice Antonin Scalia's son, as secretary of labor -- replacing Alex Acosta, who resigned over the fallout from the plea deal he negotiated for Jeffrey Epstein in 2008. "I am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate Gene Scalia as the new Secretary of Labor. Gene has led a life of great success in the legal and labor field and is highly respected not only as a lawyer, but as a lawyer with great experience working with labor and everyone else," Trump tweeted Thursday. "He will be a great member of an Administration that has done more in the first 2 Â½ years than perhaps any Administration in history!" According to NBC News, tributes to "larger-than-life Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia poured in  both sides of the political aisle" following his death. All eight of Scalia's fellow justices released statements honoring him following his death. Justice Clarence Thomas said, "'Justice Scalia was a good man; a wonderful husband who loved his wife and his family; a man of strong faith; a towering intellect; a legal giant; and a dear, dear friend. In every case, he gave it his all to get the broad principles and the small details right.
