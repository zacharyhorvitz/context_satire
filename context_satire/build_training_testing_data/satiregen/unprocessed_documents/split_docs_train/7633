Contrary to his otherwise healthy lifestyle, Feluda enjoys smoking charminar cigarettes, exercising and chewing betel leaves. His favourite brand of cigarettes is Charminar. He is a connoisseur of delicious foods, popular music and movies, and books. He has a great appreciation for Sherlock Holmes and, according to the film Tintorettor Jishu, Bruce Lee. In September 2013, director Shoojit Sircar told the Indian media that if he got any chance to remake Satyajit Ray's Sonar Kella for a worldwide audience, he would cast actor Aamir Khan as Feluda. However, in later years Sandip Ray confirmed that this would never happen, and Shoojit Sircar also stated he had told it as a joke, he was never serious about it and he had never thought of making a Feluda film. As of September 2016, according to media reports, director Shoojit Sircar was trying to acquire the rights to Sonar Kella. By 2017, Ray expected Sarkar to show him the screenplay. "As of now, we have had no discussions regarding the casting," Ray said. Will he want to collaborate with Sarkar once the Hindi film goes on the floor? "No, it will be his baby," Ray said.
