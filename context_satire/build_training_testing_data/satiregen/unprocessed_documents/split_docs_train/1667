The Sharper Image was the brainchild of Richard Thalheimer. The company started in 1977 as a catalog business to sell jogging watches. Later, through what had become an iconic catalog, The Sharper Image expanded its product assortment to include high end, futuristic gadgets, electronics, massage chairs, and air purifiers. Popular products such as the Ionic Breeze and exclusive models of Human Touch massage chairs helped propel The Sharper Image to become an iconic American brand with 187 retail stores in 38 states. Richard Thalheimer is the founder and former CEO of American consumer brand The Sharper Image. He established The Sharper Image in 1977, inspired by a $69 jogger’s watch that he owned and other runners admired. The first runner’s watch was advertised in Runner’s World magazine. The advertisement’s success led to the inaugural distribution of The Sharper Image catalog in 1979. Richard Thalheimer is the founder and former CEO of American consumer brand The Sharper Image.
