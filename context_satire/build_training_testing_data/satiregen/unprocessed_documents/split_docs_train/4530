On December 1, 2015, Zuckerberg and Chan announced the birth of their first daughter Max, and in an open letter to Max, they pledged to transfer 99% of their Facebook shares, then valued at US$45 billion, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, their new organization that will focus on health and education. The funds will not be transferred immediately, but over the course of their lives. Instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to, as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and other tech billionaires have done, Zuckerberg and Chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company. This has drawn criticism from a number of journalists.  Sheryl Sandberg has a message for college grads: be "clear-eyed optimists." The Facebook COO addressed graduates at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Friday, urging them to pursue work that supports equality, democracy, truth and kindness. But she emphasized during her commencement speech to keep an eye out for challenges ahead by "looking around corners  throwing up every possible roadblock against hate, violence, and deception." She added: "You might be thinking, given some of the issues Facebook has had, isn't what I'm saying hitting pretty close to home? Zuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&A session at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014. The founder and CEO explained that he does not believe Facebook is a waste of time, because it facilitates social engagement, and participating in a public session was so that he could "learn how to better serve the community".
