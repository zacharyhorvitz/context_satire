Thirteen takes a woman (Angela Gots) with whom she had a one-night stand to Princeton-Plainsboro after the woman has a seizure in Thirteen's apartment. House and the team take on her case, House using it as an opportunity to explore Thirteen's personal life. Thirteen ends up finding out the patient only slept with her to get to House, who had been rejecting the woman as a patient for many years. Meanwhile, Lucas continues on Wilson's trail. House and the team take on the case of a woman (Judith Scott) who collapsed in the middle of a cooking class. When they learn that the patient gave up her career as a highly renowned cancer researcher in order to pursue her own personal happiness, the members of the team question their own happiness (or lack thereof). Meanwhile, Thirteen begins to suffer serious and life-threatening reactions to her experimental Huntington's disease clinical drug trial, and Cuddy retaliates against House and gives him a taste of his own medicine. A deaf 14-year-old boy, Seth (Ryan Lane), collapses in the middle of a wrestling match after "hearing" explosions. House suffers from lack of sleep, which causes him to hallucinate that Amber is with him, helping him to solve the case. House also plans Chase's bachelor party — much to the dismay of Cameron — with the help of Amber. But House soon realizes that Amber is dangerous, and that she is not helpful to the case when Cuddy calls him to let him know that his diagnosis was wrong.
