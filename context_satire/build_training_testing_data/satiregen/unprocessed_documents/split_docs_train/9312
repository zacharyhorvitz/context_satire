 Alabama's Secretary of State John Merrill, a Republican, said Thursday night that sexual misconduct claims being leveled against GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore should be disqualifying if proven to be true. The allegations were reported in the Washington Post, which alleged that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32. Three other women also told the Post that Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s. Asked on CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront" if the charges were disqualifying, Merrill said, "I think most of the people in the state of Alabama would be very disappointed if someone that had been alleged to have engaged in that type of activity, had been proven that they had engaged in that activity, was continuing to represent them in any formal capacity."  Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger called for Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore to step aside immediately, and the Senate should expel him if seated, following the recent sexual assault allegations made against him. "I think Roy Moore needs to step aside now," Kinzinger, from Illinois, told CNN's Jake Tapper on "The Lead" Friday. "These allegations are disgusting and I believe them against him. And there's no way to defend this."  Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said that as of Tuesday, he would still vote for Roy Moore unless the mounting sex allegations against the Republican Senate candidate were proven true. "As of today, with the information that's been introduced to me, and if these charges are not proven to be true, then I would continue to support and vote for Judge Moore," Merrill said on CNN's "New Day." Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct by at least five women in the past week. The Washington Post published a bombshell report based on interviews with more than 30 people, saying Moore pursued relationships with four teenagers while he was in his 30s.
