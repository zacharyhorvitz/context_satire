The Carr Fire raging in Northern California has claimed six lives and destroyed at least 966 structures. At least 19 people were still reported missing in Shasta County, California, officials said at a community meeting Monday evening.  Catastrophic wildfires continue to ravage California, as one blaze nearly doubled in size over the last three days, making it the largest in the state's history. No one has been injured in the Mendocino Complex Fire, which consists of two fires -- the Ranch Fire and the River Fire -- burning around Clear Lake, in several counties in Northern California. Combined, they form the biggest blaze that California firefighters are currently battling. Altogether, the Mendocino Complex Fire has burned 283,800 acres -- growing about 80% since Friday night.  It happens countless times on roads across America: a vehicle gets a flat tire, usually just a temporary inconvenience. But on one road near Redding, California, when a tire failed last month on a trailer and its rim scraped the asphalt, the result was  catastrophic for an entire region. The sparks that shot out July 23 from that minor incident, California fire officials said, ignited what is now the sixth-most destructive wildfire in state history. The Carr Fire blazed a fiery path along Highway 299, lighting up mile after mile of dry brush as it crept up on residential areas.
