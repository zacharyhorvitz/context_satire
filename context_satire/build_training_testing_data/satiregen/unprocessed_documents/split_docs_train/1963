The novel opens on an overcast October 23. Two friends - William "Will" Halloway and Jim Nightshade - both on the verge of their fourteenth birthdays, encounter a strange lightning rod salesman, Tom Fury. He announces that a storm is coming their way. The salesman gives Jim a lightning rod because he tells the boys that one of their houses is in danger and they do not have money to buy one. In 1987, he said, "I wouldn't mind living until I'm 110. I still swim, do calisthenics, and keep fit. I've never been in hospital, except for a hernia operation at one time. People laugh about my using so many vitamins. With Ana back in town Skye begins to feel insecure about her relationship with Ben. Danielle proposes a double date inviting Skye and Ben to go with her and Sean and winds up a little by inviting Ana along for her last day. To see which girl Ben likes more, when Ana falls in, Danielle pushes Skye into the water as well. Ben ends up saving Ana but only because she can't swim, leaving Sean to have to go save Skye, and while he is kayaking over to her, he bumps into Danielle's kayak, causing her to fall in.
