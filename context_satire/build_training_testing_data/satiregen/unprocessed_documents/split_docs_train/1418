 After two primary rounds, dozens of debates and thousands of hours grinding it out on the stump, Mitt Romney and his campaign reached the top of Republican Party presidential politics and found themselves focusing on a new topic: him. Having spent the past week pumping up Romney the man, Republicans post-convention understand that they back a nominee viewed at times as aloof and whose guarded characteristics seem hard wired. If history is a guide, building on the Republican convention effort to push "likability" will be as important to the nominee's success in November as trying to convince voters that he can put more people to work and lift a sagging economy. After nearly six years running for president, most voters knew who Romney was.  Republicans raised the question in their convention of whether the country is better off than it was when President Barack Obama was elected, and it doesn't seem that Democrats have a convincing argument going into their convention this week. Both Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan had a variation on the theme in their acceptance speeches last week in Tampa, Florida. Romney: "This president cannot tell us that you're better off today than when he took office." Ryan: "Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?"  Mitt Romney delivered the defining speech of his life when he accepted the Republican nomination for president last night. Romney shared personal anecdotes and aimed at President Obama’s last four years in office in the attempt to win over undecided and Independent voters and allow the American public the opportunity to get to know him.

His speech “did exactly what Mitt Romney needed to do,” Frum says.
