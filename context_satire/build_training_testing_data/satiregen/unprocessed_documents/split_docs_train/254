At the top of the tower, they discover David and Sam in the vault as they unlock a suitcase. It is revealed that David and Sam orchestrated the night's events with actors in order to steal back their greatest invention - a headset that maximizes the power of a person's Quirk. I-Island's top men decided that it was too dangerous, took their invention and research away, and locked it up so it wouldn't end up in the wrong hands. Deciding that All Might needed it to remain a hero and keep the world safe, David decided to get his invention back. Nine and his gang arrive on the island and destroy all the ships and communication towers. Class 1-A learn of the invasion and split up to stop the villains and escort the islander residents to safety. Half of the class was able to defeat Mummy, but the other half was no match for Chimera. Nine eventually finds the children and confirms Katsuma as possessing the Quirk he's after, but Midoriya intervenes before he can steal it; however, he is proven to be no match for Nine. With the island fully restored, and Nine's gang apprehended, the class spends the rest of their scheduled time to fix up the island before being sent back home. Midoriya and Bakugo, who has no memory of being given One-For-All, get to say one last goodbye to Katsuma and Mahoro, as Katsuma is reminded by Midoriya that he too can be a great hero one day, with a promise to see him enter U.A. in the future.
