Ken Burns and I decided to remaster The Civil War for several reasons. First of all when we completed the film in 1989, we were operating under a very tight schedule and budget. As the main editor on the film, I always wanted to go back and improve the overall quality of the film. The other reason for remastering the film at this time is that the technology to color correct, print and transfer a film to video for broadcast has vastly improved, especially in the realm of digital computer technology... We also were able to eliminate a great deal of the dust and dirt that often get embedded into 16mm film when it is printed.  Ken Burns' PBS documentaries are always classy affairs, linking a single topic to the vast rubric of American history. Still, there are greater and lesser works within that filmography, and "Country Music" -- an eight-part, 16-hour epic about a lot more than done-me-wrong songs -- distinctly falls into the latter scale. Over the last 30 years, Burns' signature war trilogy -- "The Civil War," "The War" (about World War II) and "The Vietnam War" -- provides the spine of his work for public television. Yet the collaboration also has devoted admirable time to "The National Parks," "Baseball" and "Prohibition," albeit with less operatic heft. Burns often gives life to still photographs by slowly zooming in on subjects of interest and panning from one subject to another. For example, in a photograph of a baseball team, he might slowly pan across the faces of the players and come to rest on the player who is the subject of the narrator. This technique, possible in many professional and home software applications, is termed "The Ken Burns effect" in Apple's iPhoto, iMovie, and Final Cut Pro X software applications. It has long been used in film production where it is known as the "rostrum camera".
