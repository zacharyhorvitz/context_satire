Grace traces Sarah's messages to Laredo, Texas. Barely evading the Rev-9 and the authorities while crossing the Mexicoâ€“United States border, they arrive at their source, where they discover the same T-800 that murdered John. Having fulfilled its mission and with Skynet no longer existing, the T-800 was left aimless. Through learning however, it became self-aware. In 2020, an advanced Terminator, the Rev-9, is sent back in time to Mexico City, to murder Daniella "Dani" Ramos, who will become a threat to the machines in the future. A cybernetically enhanced soldier, Grace, is sent from 2042 to protect her. The Rev-9, disguised as Dani's father, infiltrates the automobile assembly plant where Dani and her brother Diego work, but is thwarted by Grace, who escapes with the siblings. The Rev-9, revealing its ability to split into its cybernetic endoskeleton and shape-shifting liquid metal exterior, pursues them, killing Diego and cornering Grace and Dani. In the third series in 2008, Whiston was partnered with another Emmerdale actress, Linda Lusardi and again they initially trained in Bradford. Following Lusardi's departure from the soap, and subsequent return to her family home in the south of England, it was revealed that Whiston had temporarily moved in with her family, to enable them to practise without the need for excessive travelling. Initial training was problematic as Lusardi broke her foot. They were voted out in week seven, finishing sixth, in a skate-off with actress Zaraah Abrahams and her partner Fred Palascak.
