In 1864, before plans for the University were drawn up, Asa Packer himself had sold a lot on what would soon become Lehigh's campus, to a group of Moravians. They quite promptly erected a stone church, and services were commenced before the year was out. However, the young group soon received notification of Mr. Packer's plans to found a great University on the land all around the young Church. After no doubt some difficult negotiations, the Moravians did agree to move, provided another suitable plot of land was granted them. The offices of the College of Arts and Sciences and several of its departments are located in Maginnes Hall. In addition to classrooms and faculty offices, Maginnes houses the International Multimedia Resource Center and its "World View Room," where students and faculty can watch domestic and international cultural and news programs on wide-screen television down-linked via satellite. The ground floor of Maginnes used to house the University Bookstore which was relocated to Campus Square upon its completion. The building is connected to the STEPS building via a passageway on the second floor. The years between the end of World War I and the end of World War II were somewhat poor ones for Lehigh. Seven coaches came and went, managing a record of 73–124–17 (34%) during this time. Better days were coming though, in the form of a young head coach named William Leckonby. Leckonby arrived in time for the 1946 season and within a year, had the fortunes reversed.
