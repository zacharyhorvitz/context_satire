 Critically acclaimed director Oliver Stone is now the co-author of a controversial new history book entitled, “The Untold History of the United States.” In it, he covers what he considers “ignored” stories of the nation’s past. The book releases in tandem with a new 10-part Showtime documentary series, which premiers this week. Stone joins Soledad O’Brien on “Starting Point” to talk about the importance of understanding the country's history. Stone describes the rationale behind the title of the series.  Theodore Olson says he is not going anywhere after Election Day. "I've been clearing my calendar just in case I need to be ready for the next five weeks," the Washington "super lawyer" and Romney adviser joked with CNN recently. "I don't know, no one knows, you read these polls and it could come out any of a zillion different ways." Olson was the appellate attorney who successfully argued before the Supreme Court in the 2000 Florida ballot recount case, which handed the presidency to George W. Bush.  Iran's quest for a nuclear weapon has been the subject of much debate this election season, but the presidential candidates rarely discuss the most imminent danger Iran poses to the United States: cyberwarfare. Iran is believed to be behind a slew of massive attacks in September that took down a string of U.S. banks' websites. The country is also thought to have launched a devastating cyber time bomb on Saudi Oil company Aramco in August and to have coordinated a similar attack on Qatar's RasGas, an Exxon Mobil subsidiary. The bank attacks were 10 to 20 times bigger than a typical denial of service attack, and doubled the previous record for traffic maliciously directed at a particular site, according to CrowdStrike, a security firm that investigated the attacks.
