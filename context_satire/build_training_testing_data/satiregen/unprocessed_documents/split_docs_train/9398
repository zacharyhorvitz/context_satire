After Kasdan made his successful directorial debut with Body Heat he was asked to direct The Bodyguard but he was reluctant, preferring to make The Big Chill. Kevin Costner read the script when making Silverado with Kasdan and became enthusiastic about it. The two men decided to produce it together. After Costner became a major star with the success of The Untouchables and Robin Hood, among others, he had the clout to make The Bodyguard. Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review, writing that "While the beats of the story are often stock, the picture benefits from sensitive direction by New Zealander Niki Caro and from a most appealing performance by Kevin Costner." James Rocchi of The Wrap wrote "A feel-good movie that earns all those good feelings, McFarland USA might be running on a predetermined track, but the heart it shows along the journey is what makes it a winner." A.O. Scott of The New York Times described the film favorably as "a slick and safe Disney version of a fascinating and complicated reality", and that "Mr. Costner, with his knack for grumpy understatement, manages both to dominate the film and to deflect attention from himself." Trying to pick up their trail the next day, Hamer is told that Clyde had breakfast in Amarillo and returned to Dallas to find out the white rabbit had been delivered to Bonnie's family. The Rangers go to the (business) garage of Henry Barrow, Clyde's father, where Hamer confronts him and the father tearfully asks Hamer to "end it" for his family, knowing his son would never be taken alive.
