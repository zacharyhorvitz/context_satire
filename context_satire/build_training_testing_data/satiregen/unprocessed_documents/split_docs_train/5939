 On both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, key questions are lingering after Mexico's presidential vote. Election authorities projected Enrique Pe単a Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, as the winner Sunday night. But his closest competitor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, has not conceded. The election results raise issues rooted in Mexico's complicated political past that will play a critical role in shaping the nation's future, analysts say.  The leader of Mexico's leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, announced Tuesday that he has asked Mexico's Federal Election Institute for a recount of the ballots cast in Sunday's presidential election. Lopez Obrador's demand came the day after he said the vote had been "plagued by irregularities." Election authorities have projected Lopez Obrador as the runner-up in the vote. Mexico's presumed president-elect, Enrique Pe単a Nieto, said Monday it was time for his country to leave behind the political rancor of campaign season.  More than a week after Mexico's presidential election, the candidate who authorities describe as the runner-up said a partial recount was not enough to erase his doubts about the vote. "We cannot accept these results," Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters Monday, vowing to file a formal complaint before a tribunal on Thursday, the legal deadline for challenging the election results. Lopez Obrador asserted that presumptive president-elect Enrique Pe単a Nieto and his party bought millions of votes in the election -- an accusation party officials have denied. "I am president by the majority decision of the Mexicans," Pe単a Nieto told CNN last week, noting that numerous world leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama, had called to congratulate him on his win.
