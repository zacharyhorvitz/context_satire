MTM Enterprises (later known as MTM Enterprises, Inc.) was an American independent production company established in 1969 by Mary Tyler Moore and her then-husband Grant Tinker to produce The Mary Tyler Moore Show for CBS. The name for the production company was drawn from Moore's initials.MTM produced a number of successful television programs during the 1970s and 1980s. Its logo featured an orange cat named Mimsie (who was borrowed from a local shelter and then owned by one of the MTM staff, not by Moore and Tinker, who named the cat) inside a circle surrounded by gold ribbons, parodying how Leo the Lion features in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer logo.

In 2008, Green was cast as Derek Reese in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, a Resistance fighter sent to the past by the future John Connor. He is the older brother of Kyle Reese (John Connor's father) and paternal uncle of John. Green was a recurring character in Season 1 but became a regular at the start of Season 2, following a positive response from critics and fans. His character is killed by a Terminator in the penultimate episode, but another Derek from an alternate timeline is introduced in the series finale and would have remained on the show if it had been renewed for a third season.
