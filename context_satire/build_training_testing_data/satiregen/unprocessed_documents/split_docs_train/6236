Star Trek: Chains of Betrayal is a fan-fiction comedy film written and directed by Derek Howard and Racan Souiedan. The film is an episode of approximately forty minutes in length that takes place during season five of Star Trek: The Next Generation, soon after the events in "Unification". The script was written during the summer months of 2005. Chains of Betrayal was made over a period of four shooting days in January 2007 at Simon Fraser University's Harbour Centre campus in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia. The entire project was completed on a budget of under $200, largely thanks to the extensive use of a green screen by the crew. Cinematography and editing were completed by Sam Scott and Jamie Quast respectively. The film debuted at Vancouver's Astoria Hotel on the night of Wednesday, April 30, 2008. The Toronto premiere was held on Saturday, September 27, 2008 as part of the Trekzac Festicon. The official DVD release party and screening took place on Thursday, November 27, 2008 in Vancouver, BC at VIVO Media Arts Centre. The film was also selected as part of Khan Con, a Star Trek mini-convention held at the Rio Theatre in Vancouver, BC on May 16, 2009.
