When Daffy accidentally emails a letter to everyone he knows telling hateful things about them, he realizes he also sent it to Tina and teams up with Porky to erase it. Meanwhile, Lola and her parents want Bugs to be in their family photo, until Bugs chips his front tooth (during a fight with Daffy, involving the main storyline) and Lola attempts to prevent him from going to the photo. Jimmy tries to make amends with Chuck in the season finale, "Lantern", but Chuck coldly cuts ties with Jimmy, telling him that "he never really mattered all that much to him". After Chuck forces Jimmy away, his EHS symptoms begin to re-emerge, and he becomes obsessed with disabling all electronic devices in his home to the point of tearing walls open to remove the wiring. He eventually reaches a breaking point and knocks a gas lantern over, setting fire to his house. After this scene, there was much speculation as to what happened to Chuck after the fire started. Daffy tries to prepare Gossamer for a school talent show to help him make friends per request of his mother, Witch Lezah. Meanwhile, Bugs becomes an instant celebrity when he stars in Speedy's frozen pizza commercial, which starts to get annoying when people began badgering him to say his quote from the commercial - "I like it." This gets ridiculous as a firefighter putting out a fire started by Daffy at Bugs' house stops putting out the flames and asks Bugs to say his quote.
