Jeb Bush is a Republican politician in the United States. Bush was governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007. He was a candidate for the Republican nomination for president of the United States in the 2016 election.  Jeb Bush asserted Thursday that he'll be the last Republican standing as he went through the pomp and circumstance of securing his name on the New Hampshire ballot, predicting he'll "win the nomination" despite his current struggle to gain traction in the presidential contest. Opinion: What happened to the joy of Jeb? It's a must-win state that his campaign is banking on, even though the latest poll shows him falling behind outsider candidates like Donald Trump and Ben Carson. First-term senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are also gaining polling momentum in the Granite State. The 2016 presidential campaign of Jeb Bush, the 43rd Governor of Florida, was formally launched on June 15, 2015, coming six months after announcing the formal exploration of a candidacy for the 2016 Republican nomination for the President of the United States on December 16, 2014, and the formation of the Right to Rise PAC. On February 20, 2016, Bush announced his intention to drop out of the presidential race following the South Carolina primary. Had Bush been elected, he would have been the first president from Florida and the first sibling of a U.S. president (George W. Bush) to win the presidency himself.
