Memphis is a city and the county seat of Hall County, Texas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 2,290. Memphis is a hamlet in the Town of Van Buren, west of Syracuse in Onondaga County, New York, United States. Because of its location on the south town line of Van Buren, above the Towns of Elbridge and Camillus, the Memphis area can also be considered to extend into Elbridge and Camillus. In the early 1800's, the hamlet was named "Canton". Sometime after the 1850's, the name was changed to the current "Memphis", presumably because Canton was already established. During her senior year of high school, Howard learned of existentialism. "I was like, 'This is it! This is my religion.' I had never felt a connection to any sort of spirituality before that.
