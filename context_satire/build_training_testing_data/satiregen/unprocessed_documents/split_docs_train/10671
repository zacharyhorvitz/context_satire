 President Barack Obama on Tuesday called for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility after delivering his plan to Congress to achieve a goal that has long eluded his presidency. The blueprint comes seven years after Obama made an Oval Office vow to permanently shutter the prison for enemy combatants, but it already faces objections from Republicans and legal obstacles they have placed to transferring Guantanamo detainees to U.S. prisons. Obama nonetheless said emptying the prison would move the country past what he described as a troubled era of wartime behavior. "The plan we're putting forward today isn't just about closing the facility at Guantanamo.  President Barack Obama on Thursday offered scant optimism that a "cessation of hostilities" agreed to in Syria would take hold when it goes into effect this weekend. Speaking after meeting with his National Security Council at the State Department, Obama suggested it was a long shot that the agreement could succeed. But he said the effort was worth it if a single Syrian's life could be improved. "None of us are under any illusions. A specific new breed of American conspiracy theorists who believe that the real problem with Barack Obama being president is that he can't possibly have been born in the United States. He's not eligible to be president. The birth certificate is a fake. He's a foreigner.
