In the early morning of Thursday, 14 February 2013, Pistorius shot and killed his girlfriend, South African model Reeva Steenkamp, at his home in Pretoria. Pistorius acknowledged that he shot Steenkamp four times, causing her death, but said that he mistook her for a possible intruder. On 3 July, under cross-examination, Derman testified "You've got a paradox of an individual who is supremely able, and you've got an individual who is significantly disabled". Derman, who had treated Pistorius over six years while working with South African Olympic and Paralympic teams, said Pistorius' anxieties included concern about flying. "He has a specific fear of being trapped somewhere without being able to move very rapidly." and that on the night he killed Steenkamp,"fleeing was not an option" as Pistorius was not wearing his artificial legs. Oscar Pistorius was accused and charged with murdering his girlfriend on February 14, 2013. The "Blade Runner", as he is known, shot 30-year-old model Reeva Steenkamp through the bathroom door of their home with a 9mm pistol he said he kept under his bed. Oscar Pistorius, who was 27 years old at the time of the shooting, stated that he believed it was an intruder in the bathroom, and not his girlfriend, after hearing the sound of the window being opened. The couple had been in a relationship since 2012 after attending an award show together.
