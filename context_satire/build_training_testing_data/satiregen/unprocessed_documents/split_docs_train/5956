 Nevada brothel magnate and reality television star Dennis Hof has gone by many nicknames over the years, some self-appointed, others bestowed upon him: "American pimp," the "P.T. Barnum of Booty," "America's pimpmaster general." Beneath the colorful monikers, Hof is a hard-nosed businessman who dove into damage-control mode when news broke that basketball player Lamar Odom was found unresponsive in one of Hof's seven Nevada brothels. Hof shared details of Odom's stay at the Love Ranch with CNN and other news outlets in an attempt to quash rumors that Odom used cocaine on the property.  About 70 hostages facing "imminent mass execution" were rescued and an American service member was killed in an operation against an ISIS-controlled prison in northern Iraq, the Pentagon said Thursday. The commando became the first American combat death in Iraq since November 2011. The hostages -- including more than 20 members of the Iraqi Security Forces, local residents and several ISIS fighters accused of spying -- were liberated in the helicopter assault, which involved U.S. special operations troops as well as Kurdish and Iraqi forces, U.S. officials said. "There was not a lot of time," one U.S. official told CNN on condition of anonymity. The meaning of the word American in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. American is derived from America, a term originally denoting all of the New World (also called the Americas). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the United States of America. In modern English, American generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification.
