 Slowly but surely, the most unpredictable and unusual primary in modern Republican history is becoming clearer. After Tuesday night's debate on Fox Business, it's still an outsider-dominated race, but at least part of the conventional wisdom looks to be coming true. That conventional wisdom has held that Donald Trump will ultimately decline, likely followed by Ben Carson as well. And while nothing in Tuesday night's performance spells instant doom in polls for either man, a fatal erosion of credibility seems to be gaining speed.  Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina dismissed concerns from their Republican opponents about the debate format Monday, but South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said the candidates need to have a say as Republicans look for a path forward after Wednesday's debate. Christie said Monday that while the moderators of the last GOP presidential debate did a poor job, he and his fellow Republican candidates should not get to control the debate format. The New Jersey governor, whose most memorable moment in the CNBC debate came as he slammed the moderators for asking about fantasy football, took to the airwaves to suggest that he wasn't concerned about the handling of the debates. While representatives from the GOP presidential campaigns met Sunday evening to discuss ways to reform the debate process, Christie said debate negotiations should stay in the hands of the Republican National Committee.  It was 12 against one at the Republican debates in Milwaukee. And the star of the show wasn't even on stage. Hillary Clinton has not yet won a single vote in the Democratic nominating contest, but the GOP candidates have called the race already. Every candidate in the prime-time show mentioned the Democratic front-runner at least once -- and they didn't have good things to say.
