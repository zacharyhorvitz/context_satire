 NASA astronaut Nick Hague has an office with a view to rival anyone on Earth because he can see all of it. Over the weekend, NASA shared a stunning timelapse of Hague's view from the International Space Station. The video condensed 30 minutes of orbit time around the Earth, going from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean, into one beautiful minute. The many clouds visible only added to the awe-inspiring view taken from 254 miles above Earth.  Firefighters are still working to contain a fast-moving wildfire in the Tonto National Forest in Arizona. The Mountain Fire, which was reported Friday afternoon, has burned about 7,225 acres in the national forest northeast of Phoenix, according to InciWeb, an interagency emergency management service. The fire was human-caused, officials said, without providing more details. Strong winds are making it difficult to fight the fire, CNN affiliate KPHO reported.
