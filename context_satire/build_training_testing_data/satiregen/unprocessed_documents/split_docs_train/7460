The Canadian community is one of the earliest western communities of Bahá'ís, at one point sharing a joint National Spiritual Assembly with the United States, and is a co-recipient of `Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan. The first North American woman to declare herself a Bahá'í was Kate C. Ives, of Canadian ancestry, though not living in Canada at the time. Moojan Momen, in reviewing "The Origins of the Bahá'í Community of Canada, 1898–1948" notes that "the Magee family... are credited with bringing the Bahá'í Faith to Canada. Edith Magee became a Bahá'í in 1898 in Chicago and returned to her home in London, Ontario, where four other female members of her family became Bahá'ís. Savannah Delongpre (Melinda Clarke) is a wealthy runway fashion model living in New York City who returns to her small town in Georgia in order to get away from her stressful and demanding spotlight life and to visit her wealthy grandmother, Belle (Louise Fletcher; the only actress to appear in this and the previous Two Moon Junction film). While staying with Belle, Savannah views some homemade 8mm films about her childhood past which include her recently deceased mother. There is also a subtle reference to the first Two Moon Junction film in which Belle tells Savannah about her cousin April having abandoned her recently married husband to run off with a stranger. Fletcher's greatest success, Sorry, Wrong Number, premiered on May 25, 1943, as an episode of the radio series Suspense. Agnes Moorehead created the role in the first performance and again in several later radio productions. It was broadcast nationwide seven times between 1943 and 1948. Fletcher's daughter Dorothy Herrmann told The New York Times that Fletcher got the idea for Sorry, Wrong Number when she was buying food for her sick child at a local grocery on Manhattan's East Side, and a well-dressed woman with an obnoxious manner refused to allow Fletcher to go ahead of her in line.
