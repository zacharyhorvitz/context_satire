Amway Grand Plaza: Here's a world-class hotel plunked in the middle of Michigan, occupying the opulently restored shell of the old Pantlind Hotel and a sleek 29-story adjoining wing. Service during my April stay was small-town cheerful, the room was richly furnished, and dinner in the top-of-the-line Cygnus restaurant stood up to New York or San Francisco standards. The Grand River Promenade, the official name for the skyway, provides a comfortable for visitors, with the Promenade spanning from the DeVos Place Convention Center, through the hotel and ending at the Van Andel Arena. The skyway is on the hotel's second floor as well as the hotel's parking ramp. Amway Grand Plaza Hotel is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan and is named after Amway Corporation, which is based in nearby Ada Township.
