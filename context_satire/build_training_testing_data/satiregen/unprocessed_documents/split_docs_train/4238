When Simeon orders Franklin to repossess the vehicle of Jimmy De Santa, Jimmy's father Michael holds a gun to Franklin's head and orders him to drive the car through the window of the dealership, which in turn leads to Franklin being fired. In-awe of Michael's professional criminality, Franklin seeks him out for possible employment. Michael sees great potential in Franklin, and later employs him in jobs, including many heists and the two soon forge a close father/son bond (Michael openly calls him "the son I never had"). Meanwhile, Franklin clashes with Harold "Stretch" Joseph, a Families OG member who was recently released from prison, that believes he can give Franklin orders due to his higher status within the gang; a notion that Franklin resents. Lamar Davis is Franklin's best friend. He is played by Slink Johnson. Lamar is a gangbanger in the Families, and previously worked as a repossession agent for Simeon Yetarian alongside Franklin. However, Lamar has opposing ideals with Franklin; while the former appears to be more concentrated on the gang, the latter is more focused on serious money-making opportunities outside the gang life. At this time, many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly were feuding with William Penn's heirs, who controlled the colony as proprietors. After his return to the colony, Franklin led the "anti-proprietary party" in the struggle against the Penn family, and was elected Speaker of the Pennsylvania House in May 1764. His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation, however: Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms. Because of these fears, and because of political attacks on his character, Franklin lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections.
