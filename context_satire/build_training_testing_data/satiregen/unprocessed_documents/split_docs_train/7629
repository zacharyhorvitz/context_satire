 A grid failure cut power supplies in northern India on Monday, hitting rail and road transport for hours in the country's worst blackout in a decade, authorities said. The outage held up at least 300 trains in the region, Indian railway spokesman Anil Kumar Saxena told CNN. India's Power System Corporation Limited reported the collapse at 2.35 a.m. local time. Officials say it affected seven states in northern India, home to more than 350 million people.  An Indian court has ruled that the organizer of the scandal-plagued 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi is forbidden from attending the opening ceremony of the London Olympics. The presence at the ceremony of Suresh Kalmadi, who was arrested last year on corruption charges related to the Commonwealth Games, would be "contrary to national interest," the High Court of Delhi said Wednesday. The legal action seeking to restrict Kalmadi's movements was filed after a different court had authorized him to travel to London. He had sought permission for the trip in order to attend meetings of the International Association of Athletics Federations.  The Indian anti-graft crusader Anna Hazare has begun a new hunger strike to add pressure to his persistent demands for a tough law to deal with endemic corruption in the country. Hazare and his supporters are also seeking special investigations into allegations of corruption they have made against more than a dozen of India's federal government ministers, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh -- accusations the government denies. A 75-year-old former army driver, Hazare galvanized the nation last year with his use of fasting to demand a strong citizen ombudsman to tackle official corruption. The attention his protest generated brought huge political pressure to bear on Singh, who agreed in August to Hazare's demand for the new anti-corruption agency.
