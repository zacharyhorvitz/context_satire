Wanting access to the intel, Silva's team is instructed to take Noor to an airplane at an airstrip 22 miles away, being provided with remote assistance from Bishop's team in Colombia. En route they are attacked by a group of men on motorcycles, who use a brief camera blackout to plant a bomb on one of the vehicles. During the ensuing gunfight, operative Sam Snow is mortally injured, and sacrifices herself to buy the group time. Taking cover in a restaurant, they are again attacked by Axel's men, in which Silva is saved by Noor and operative William “Dougie” Douglas is seriously injured. Mrs Patel is a patient of Walford's general practitioner, May Wright (Amanda Drew). May writes out a double prescription for her, and takes one of the bottles of dihydrocodeine pills for her own personal use. She later tells nurse Naomi Julien (Petra Letang) that it is a mistake, after Mrs Patel points this out. In the final episode, Vince tells the gang that he's flying to Paris in a few hours to marry Sophia. Eric quits his job and announces that he's moving to New York to try to be a good father for his child. Turtle and Drama try to convince Sloan to forgive Eric and fly to Paris for the wedding. She's on the fence, until Vince seals the deal by giving her a heartfelt speech about Eric.
