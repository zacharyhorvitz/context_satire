 Acclaimed Public Radio International program "This American Life" has retracted an entire episode about working conditions inside Foxconn, the Chinese manufacturer that builds much of Apple's most popular hardware, after learning the reporter "partially fabricated" information about his visit to the factories. In the episode, PRI aired a monologue from reporter Mike Daisey,  a self-proclaimed performer whose one-man show, "The Agony and Ecstasy of Steve Jobs," detailed alarming labor practices which he claimed to witness during his time visiting Foxconn. Among the many facts Daisey fabricated, according to PRI, were the number of Foxconn factories he visited, the number of workers he spoke with, as well a major lie about meeting with a number of workers who claimed to have been poisoned by chemicals used on iPhone assembly lines. "Daisey lied to me and to "This American Life" producer Brian Reed during the fact checking we did on the story, before it was broadcast," the show's host, Ira Glass, wrote in a blog post on Friday.  So Mike Daisey stepped over the line. So he combined bits of fabrication with his facts about the Chinese factories that make Apple products. So he converted some research into first-person experience. So he led "This American Life" to believe that his piece, "Mr. Daisey and the Apple Factory" -- adapted from his one-man show, "The Agony and Ecstasy of Steve Jobs" -- was journalistically sound.  An American said to have been held captive for months was turned over Saturday to the U.S. Embassy, a United Nations spokeswoman said. The man had been earlier handed over to the U.N. office in Baghdad by a movement led by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, the U.N. mission in Iraq said. Two political leaders of the al-Sadr movement identified the American as Randy Michael. The man, wearing a military uniform, spoke to reporters in Baghdad on Saturday, but did not provide his name.
