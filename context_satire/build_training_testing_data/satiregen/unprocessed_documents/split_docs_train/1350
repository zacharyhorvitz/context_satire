Electronic advertising has gradually replaced printed ads and the Internet is now a venue where murderers who employ a similar modus operandi can meet their victims; in Schecter's Encyclopedia, the entry for "Ads" mentions Internet dating and the use of Internet ads by the so-called "Internet Cannibal" Armin Meiwes. Since 2007, several accused and convicted killers have contacted victims through advertising services such as Craigslist, a popular classified advertising website. These killers are sometimes referred to in the media as "Craigslist killers"; the first use of the term Craigslist killings may date to October 31, 2007, when the phrase appeared in a headline in the Saint Paul Pioneer Press in Minnesota, in reference to the murder of Katherine Olson by Michael John Anderson, who was then dubbed "the Craigslist killer". The music style of "Craigslist" has been considered to be a "dead-on parody of the Doors". Marc Hirsh of NPR noted that the composition and performance of "Craigslist" are evidence that Yankovic is a "Stealth Pop Musicologist", able to deconstruct a genre of work and recreate it into something new without being unrecognizable. Craigslist founder Craig Newmark, after being asked how he felt about the song, responded, "The thing's pretty funny!" "Craigslist" is a song and single by "Weird Al" Yankovic. It is a style parody of the Doors, and contains lyrics inspired by postings at the online classified advertising service, Craigslist. Yankovic described the idea of the song coming about thinking how it would be "anachronistically weird" for Jim Morrison to scream about Craigslist. Yankovic opted to use Craigslist as an example of something big in both the popular culture and his own life, and spent time exploring its listings to compose the lyrics.
