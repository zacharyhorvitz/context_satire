Judith Chapman, the woman who won the state lottery, but did not yet get her winnings, is kidnapped. Charlie Davis takes the phone call from the kidnapper at her home, after the neighbor called the police. Her husband Laurie is the first suspect; a woman in his company tried to start an affair with him, giving the motive. She lies to everyone about her liaison, which never happened. A group of former employees set up a factory in King Street in Derby, and continued to use the moulds, patterns and trademarks of the former business, although not the name, so keeping alive the Derby traditions of fine craftsmanship. No mechanical processes were used, and no two pieces produced were exactly the same. Among the items preserved was the original potter's wheel of the Duesburys, still owned by the present Royal Derby Company. Despite much good work, the Kean period was disruptive and the company suffered financially.
