 The sound of jackhammers reverberates through Yu Hong's Beijing studio. Outside, men in blue uniform -- shouting over the noise -- wheel piles of red bricks, while others help clear debris. The studio is located in the city's 798 Art District, a sprawling Mao-era factory that once produced military equipment used as far away as North Korea. Today it's a mix of galleries, art spaces, museums, cafes and trinket stores.  For Beijing-based artist Qiu Zhijie, maps are a way to "organize chaos" -- sometimes logically and, in other instances, playfully. His creations are less about the physical geography of a space than the relationships of complex, often intangible subjects. Over a period of months, Qiu will research topics such as fate, politics, religion and even mythical animals, meticulously positioning concepts in relation to one another using sketches and mind-mapping software. Elements of traditional maps, like roads, tunnels, railways, rivers and peaks, also feature, representing the connections between different ideas.  President Trump complains that China isn't doing enough to squeeze Kim Jong Un's regime over its nuclear weapons program. "North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success," he tweeted last month. He returned to the theme Monday, tweeting that American policy hasn't worked. The U.S. president wants China to use its position as North Korea's main trading partner to force Kim to change his behavior.
