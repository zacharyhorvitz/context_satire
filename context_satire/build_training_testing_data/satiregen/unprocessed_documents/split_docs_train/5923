Matthew Green (born 17 October 1975) is a British journalist and author. He was raised in Hampton Middlesex where he attended Hampton School before he studied African politics at Oxford University and spent five years on the ground in East Africa reporting for Reuters. He is currently the South Asia Security Correspondent for the Financial Times. Matthew’s first book, entitled The Wizard of the Nile: The Hunt for Africa’s Most Wanted, documents his search through the war zone of Uganda for Joseph Kony, the mysterious rebel leader known for abducting children and using them as child soldiers. In part due to his close physical resemblance to Kelsey Grammer, the producers of the Cheers spin-off Frasier created the role of Niles Crane (Frasier Crane's younger brother) for him. Although prior to Frasier going into production, Pierce had petitioned the Screen Actors Guild to change his billing to David Pierce, the name he had used on the stage, the use of his middle name in the show's credits helped reinforce the actor's and the character's "snooty" image. For his work on Frasier, Pierce was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy a record eleven consecutive years, winning in 1995, 1998, 1999 and 2004. One element of the original concept that was carried over was the live-in health-care provider for Frasier's father. Grammer points out that very little of the Frasier Crane of Cheers carried over to Frasier, as his family history was changed (though this was later adjusted); the setting, his job, and even the character himself changed from the Cheers predecessor, having to be more grounded as the central character of the show so the other supporting characters could be more eccentric.
