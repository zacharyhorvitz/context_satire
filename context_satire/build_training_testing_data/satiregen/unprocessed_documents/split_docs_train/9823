Glass attended Milford Mill High School in Baltimore County where he held editorial roles as a member of the school's yearbook staff and as co-editor of the student literary magazine. His involvement in yearbook started in tenth grade and continued until his graduation in 1977. As a member of the Milford drama club, Glass was involved in several stage productions. His roles include Captain George Brackett in Milford's 1975 production of South Pacific, Lowe in the school's 1976 production of Damn Yankees, and Bud Frump in its 1977 production of How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Woodlawn High School (WHS) is a four-year public high school in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. The school opened in the fall of 1961. Prior to that, students in the area attended Catonsville, Milford Mill or Franklin High Schools. In the fall of 2017, Woodlawn offered an Early College Program to help students prepare for a university education. In 1989, when his then-girlfriend, cartoonist Lynda Barry, moved to Chicago, he followed her there, settling into the Lakeview neighborhood. Soon, he began producing award-winning reports for NPR's All Things Considered, specifically on school reform at Taft High School and Irving Elementary School. However, it was a piece he did on the 75th anniversary of Oreo cookies that, he said, taught him how to write for radio. Soon, he and Gary Covino created and co-hosted a Friday-night WBEZ Chicago Public Radio program called The Wild Room, which featured eclectic content with a loose style.
