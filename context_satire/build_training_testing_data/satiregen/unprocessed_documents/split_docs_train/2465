The Tibetan people (Tibetan: བོད་པ་, Wylie: bod pa, THL: bö pa, Chinese: 藏族) are an ethnic group native to Tibet. Their current population is estimated to be around 6.8 million. In addition to living in Tibet Autonomous Region, significant numbers of Tibetans live in other parts of China, as well as in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan and the western world. Tibetans speak Tibetan languages, many varieties of which are mutually unintelligible, which belongs to the Tibeto-Burman language group. Old Tibetan refers to the period of Tibetan language reflected in documents from the adoption of writing by the Tibetan Empire in the mid-7th century to works of the early 11th century. In 816 CE, during the reign of Sadnalegs, literary Tibetan underwent a thorough reform aimed at standardizing the language and vocabulary of the translations being made from Indian texts, and this resulted in what we now call Classical Tibetan. Tibetan names typically consist of two juxtaposed elements. Family names are rare except among those of aristocratic ancestry and then come before the personal name (but diaspora Tibetans living in societies that expect a surname may adopt one). For example, in Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Ngapoi was his family name and Nga-Wang Jigmê his personal name. Tibetan nomads (drokpa) also use clan names; in farming communities, they are now rare and may be replaced by household name.
