 The Obama administration will announce a series of executive actions on Tuesday to combat gun violence in the U.S. Among other things, the actions would expand mandatory background checks for some private sales. The administration would also provide more funding for mental health treatment, FBI staff and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives agents. "These are not only recommendations that are well within my legal authority and the executive branch," Obama told reporters gathered Monday in the Oval Office.  Arizona sheriff Paul Babeu said Friday he was still waiting for an answer from President Barack Obama on how he would address the mental health issues underlying gun violence. "We already know that all of these gun restrictions that have failed, we can't ignore that information, and that's what I was trying to get at with the president, that we have to look to solve these issues," Babeu told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day." Babeu, who is seeking the Republican nomination for Arizona's 1st District seat in Congress, pressed Obama on the question of mental health funding at CNN's town hall Thursday night. "What would you have done to prevent these mass shootings and the terrorist attack.  President Barack Obama is mounting a final-year push to make gun control part of his legacy despite Republican opposition and is expected to announce unilateral action early this week. He will join CNN's Anderson Cooper Thursday for an exclusive one-hour live town hall on gun control at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, in hopes of mounting a final pitch to the public. It's an issue he has had zero success on so far in his presidency, despite his repeated, emotional appeals for change. Congress has remained a roadblock even in the face of widespread public support for Obama's past calls for universal background checks or bolstered mental health support, with near uniform opposition from Republicans and a split on the issue among Democrats.
