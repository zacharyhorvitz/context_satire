Monmouth University is a private university in West Long Branch, New Jersey. Founded in 1933 as Monmouth Junior College, it became Monmouth College in 1956 and Monmouth University in 1995 after receiving its charter. There are about 4,400 full-time and 260 part-time undergraduate and 1,750 graduate students, as well as 302 full-time faculty members. About 80% of faculty members hold Ph.D.s or other terminal degrees in their field of study.  Smaller US-based companies that do most of their business in America were supposed to hold up better than the giants of the Dow and S&P 500 at a time when there are concerns about a shaky global economy and US trade tension with China. But the Russell 2000, an index that focuses on small US stocks, has fallen nearly 15% since the start of last October while the Dow and S&P 500 are each down about 10% over the past few months. That's despite the fact that multinationals in the Dow and S&P 500 like Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Boeing (BA) and Nike (NKE) have significant exposure to China and Europe. What gives?  The upcoming Martin Luther King Jr. holiday takes on added significance this year, on what would have been a special birthday for the iconic civil rights leader. On Tuesday, January 15, 2019, Martin Luther King Jr. would have turned 90 years old. Of course, King did not even live to reach middle age, being cut down by an assassin's bullet while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on Thursday, April 4, 1968. The Lorraine Motel is now a national civil rights museum, offering a hopeful sign of the immense political and social transformations that have taken place since that fateful day.
