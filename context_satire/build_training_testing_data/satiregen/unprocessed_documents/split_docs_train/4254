Kieffer (from Series 4 "Invasion") returns in this episode, and we learn of his wife and two children. Also returning are Foyle's son, who had been flying in Malta prior to discharge, and Pierce (from Series 2  "War Games" and Series 3 "The French Drop"). With the war in Europe winding down, Foyle is retiring and the station is being moved to another location. Milner received a promotion to DI and transfer to Brighton, while Edith, his new wife, is expecting their first child, a daughter. Foyle has been in "retirement" after his resignation a year earlier at the end of Casualties of War. Stewart has been removed as a police driver (in the Mechanised Transport Corps) by Foyle's replacement, Meredith, and has been working as a librarian in the Air Ministry's cartography facility at Beverley Lodge for the last six months. She is also "assisting" Foyle as his typist in writing his book on the Hastings Constabulary (even though she does not appear to be that capable). In addition, her uncle Aubrey Stewart (Brian Poyser), a priest, returns from the episode "The French Drop", when he visits Hastings for the bishop's conference. Tod Stiles, portrayed by clean-cut Milner, is the epitome of the decent, honest, all-American type. Tod came from a background of wealth and privilege; his father owned a shipping company, and Tod's early years were spent in New York and Connecticut. He attended Yale, but after the death of his father, Tod discovered that his father's business had essentially gone bankrupt. The only legacy left to Tod was a new Corvette.
