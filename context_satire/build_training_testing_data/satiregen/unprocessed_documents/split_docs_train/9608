Following the promo's release, Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis), took to her Twitter account to engage fans in a guessing game as to the identity of Sam's father. During the week the promo was released, it was announced that actor William deVry, who formerly starred on The Bold and the Beautiful as Storm Logan, and All My Children as Michael Cambias  was joining General Hospital. There were reports that deVry had taped scenes with Maura West's Ava Jerome, leading to speculation that deVry could be joining the show as a Jerome and as Sam's father. deVry made his debut on July 30, 2013 under the alias Derek Wells, and it was soon revealed that he was actually Julian Jeromeâ€”son of mob boss Victor Jerome who was head of the Port Charles mob in the 1980s. Outlaw was born in Aberdeen, South Dakota as Sam Morgan. At the age of 10, his family moved to southern California. He grew up in a conservative Christian home and was limited by his parents as to what kind of music he could listen to. He did however, note the influence of Western Swing band Asleep at the Wheel and how their all-star tribute albums to Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys acted as "country music in a bottle" for him. During the week of the couple's wedding and reception festivities, according to TV by the Numbers, General Hospital's ratings hit a two-month high in their coveted 'Women 18-49' demo. General Hospital was also the most watched show in ABC Daytime for that week, surpassing other shows such as The View, and they ranked second behind The Young and the Restless in the top five daytime programs for Women 18-49. The projected day of their wedding also saw an increase of 303,000 viewers from previous days that week. The couple has also gained some famous and notable fans; in 2012 Jason and Sam were mentioned in a USA Today interview as being the favorite daytime pairing of The New York Times best selling author and romance novelist Carly Phillips.
