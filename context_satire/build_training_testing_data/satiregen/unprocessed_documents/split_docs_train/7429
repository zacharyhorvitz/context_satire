The National Catapult Contest originated out of a simple directive from the Academic Development Committee of Indianapolis' Park School for Boys (now Park Tudor School) in December 1965, which "urged the faculty to review continuously the content and method of their instruction," and "further, not to forego unusual methods of stimulating the interest and involvement of students." Acting on this directive, Bernard F. Barcio, then the Latin Master of the school, announced to his class that he would support them in the undertaking of a project of their choice, so long as it pertained somehow to Latin. According to Barcio, "It was then that sophomore David Leve suggested that the Latin II class (thirteen members in all) build an authentic Roman Catapult." In the 1990s, Valdis also served with distinction as a member of the Hocąk Wazijaci Language & Culture Program board in Mauston, Wisconsin, working with members of the Ho-Chunk Nation to navigate the many options for a new Hocąk language spelling system. In 1994 he compiled a large lexicon of the Hocąk language, which came to be fondly known as the "Zepsicon."  President Barack Obama ventured into the South Florida Everglades on Wednesday to lend urgency to his environmental agenda, declaring the dangers of climate change an imminent threat to the state's economy. "We do not have time to deny the effects of climate change," Obama said, standing in front of a sawgrass prairie on the eastern edge of the 1.5 million acre wetland. "This is not some impossible problem that we cannot solve," he said. "We can solve it if we have some political will."
