 Facebook has vowed to change its data-sharing ways. But will the differences actually impact users? After days of silence following a massive data scandal, CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally commented on the issue in a Facebook post and later in interviews with CNN and other outlets. The scandal stems from new reporting that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm with ties to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, which had accessed information from 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge, might have kept that data even after Facebook told the company to delete it.  Facebook is facing an existential crisis. The Cambridge Analytica scandal has done immense damage to the brand, sources across the company believe. It will now take a Herculean effort to restore public trust in Facebook's commitment to privacy and data protection, they said. Outside observers think regulation has suddenly become more likely, and yet CEO Mark Zuckerberg appears missing in action.  Mark Zuckerberg is finally breaking his silence five days after a data scandal engulfed Facebook. The Facebook CEO pledged Wednesday to take a series of steps to protect data and fix what he called a "breach of trust" between the social network and its users. "We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you," Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post. "I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again."
