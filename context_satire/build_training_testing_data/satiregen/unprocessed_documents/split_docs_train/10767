Later, in season six, Nora's message to her parents is destroyed by the Monitor in an attempt to dissuade Barry from fighting his predestined fate. Her parents, while anticipating that a version of her would be born one day, have difficulty coping with the realization that it would not be the same Nora. The two honor their daughter by recovering her speedster jacket. In season five, Iris and Barry meet their future daughter Nora. Iris learns that her future self implanted a power dampener into Nora since infancy to hide her powers. She also discovers her future self, despite being a good mother, hid the fact that Nora's father was the Flash from her. This leads to Nora having a negative perception of her mother out of anger and Iris is guilt-ridden by her counterpart's dishonesty. Jay Garrick (portrayed by John Wesley Shipp) is the Earth-3 version of Barry's father Henry Allen. Hunter Zolomon held Jay captive in a failed attempt to harness his speed before becoming inspired to take up his persona and falsely operate as the Flash of Earth-2; even going so far as to use Jay's name. To keep him from escaping, Zolomon forced Jay to wear a mask that suppressed his speed and prevented him from talking. After Zoom's defeat, Barry rescues Jay, who soon returns to his Earth.
