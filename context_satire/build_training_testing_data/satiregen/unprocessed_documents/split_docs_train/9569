William Jr died in 1951, leaving the bakery to his wife Martha and their sons, Robert, Charles, and William. The family phased out bread in order to focus on pastries and cakes, and began supplying grocery stores rather than offering home delivery. In 1959, the Entenmann family invented the "see-through" cake box used by many bakeries today. In 1961, the business grew, with new bakeries and factories in Bay Shore, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Entenmann's as a company is over 120 years old and originated in New York City. William Entenmann learned the trade of baking from his father in Stuttgart, Germany, and used his acquired skills to work in a bakery in the US, eventually opening his own bakery in 1898 on Rogers Avenue in Brooklyn. Later, William moved his bakery to Bay Shore, Long Island. Home delivery was a substantial part of the bakery that William owned, eventually turning into 30 home delivery routes by the time his son, William Jr, took over the bakery. Plans to expand nationally stalled in 1970. Entenmann's Bakery, with the assistance of new product consultants at Calle and Company, reformulated from heavier New England-style baked goods to lighter offerings more suitable for hotter, more humid test markets such as Miami and Atlanta. Entenmann's successful national expansion quickly followed. In 1972, Entenmann's started to sell chocolate chip cookies, and has since sold more than 620 million cookies.
