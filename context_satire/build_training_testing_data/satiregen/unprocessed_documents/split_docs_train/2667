 The court of public opinion has hardly been supportive of Bill Cosby, but the 77-year-old comedian still has his defenders. Last week, singer Jill Scott engaged with several people on her Twitter account after being approached to sign a petition asking Temple University to cut its ties with Cosby. Cosby, who attended the school and served on its board, has been accused of rape by a number of women in recent weeks. Through his attorneys, he has repeatedly denied the claims.  Attorney Gloria Allred challenged comedian Bill Cosby, hounded by allegations of sexual assault, to meet his accusers in court or set aside $100 million to settle their claims. "The public deserves to know if Mr. Cosby is a saint or a sexual predator," Allred said. Because many of the claims of sexual assault are decades old, Cosby would have to agree to waive the statute of limitations, allowing his accusers to sue him. "It could be advantageous for Mr. Cosby to give up the statute of limitations because there is a huge cloud on his reputation and legacy," Allred said on Wednesday.  The University of Massachusetts Amherst and its alumnus Bill Cosby have split ways amid allegations of sexual assault and rape. At least 15 women have spoken out to various media outlets accusing the comedian of sexual misconduct. "Bill Cosby has agreed to resign as an honorary co-chair of UMass Amherst's capital campaign. He no longer has any affiliation with the campaign nor does he serve in any other capacity for the university," said Ed Blaguszewski, a spokesman for the school.
