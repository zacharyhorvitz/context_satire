The first morning zoo program, focusing on the zany interactions of two hosts, was conceived and performed in 1981 by Scott Shannon and Cleveland Wheeler of WRBQ-FM in Tampa, Florida, known at the time as Q105 FM. Wheeler had been serving as the personality DJ hosting the morning drive program for the station's previous four years. Shannon was the new operations manager in 1981. The two decided to break with tradition and work up a wilder show together, founded on their own playful, irreverent and provocative interaction, with spontaneous bits of parody and comedy leavened with straight news. Elliot in the Morning is a morning radio talk show hosted by DJ Elliot Segal. It airs weekdays from "5:48 until 10 something" on WWDC-FM in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and on WRXL in Richmond, Virginia. The program was simulcast on WOSC in Ocean City, Maryland from 2003 to 2004, on WCHH in Baltimore, Maryland from May 2008 to November 2009, and on WBWZ in the Hudson Valley of New York until 2017. Beginning in January 2014, the show was briefly simulcast on WOR-AM, while continuing to simulcast on the DC and Richmond stations, with the show originally planning to leave the DC101 studios in January 2014. In July 1983, Shannon left Tampa to reinvent WHTZ "Z-100" in the New York City market, based out of Secaucus, New Jersey. On August 2, Shannon hosted the first Z Morning Zoo at WHTZ, soon settling into a team which included straight man Ross Brittain, newscaster Claire Stevens, public service director Professor Jonathan B. Bell, 22-year-old "Captain" Kevin on the phones, and production manager J. R. Nelson. Shannon's popular new format brought WHTZ from last place to first in just 74 days, and put longtime #1 morning DJ Don Imus in second place.
