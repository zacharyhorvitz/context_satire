Criticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receiving corporate welfare. This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers in Arizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio, relied on food stamps. While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: "Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?" He later said: "Bezos could play a profound role. An alternate date in the beginning of 2006 was suggested for the pair to fight but it was imperative that Thomas defeat Baz Carey during their scheduled contest in Blackpool. Unfortunately for Thomas he lost on points to Carey and lost his chance to fight Khan. Again some felt that Thomas had been unfortunate, though not Thomas himself. This lead Thomas to get a chance to fight for the biggest pay day of his career, against Olympic silver medalist Amir Khan. Thomas was approached to fight Khan in December 2005 on the undercard of the Williams v. Harrison but he had contracted to fight Baz Carey, whom Khan had beaten three months previous to that in only his second professional fight.
