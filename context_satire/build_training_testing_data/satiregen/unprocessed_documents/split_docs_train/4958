 At long last, the royal baby has arrived. The Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to a healthy baby boy on Monday, weighing 8 lbs., 6 oz, with Prince William at her side, but what will happen now? CNN runs through the expected schedule. When will we get the first glimpse of Baby Cambridge?  Amid all the excitement about the eagerly-awaited new addition to the royal family, you may think you know all you could ever want to about royal babies. But did you know... A government minister used to be present at royal births, to make sure the baby was not switched The practice is believed to have begun in 1688, when dozens of officials watched Mary of Modena, wife of James II, give birth to a son, to scotch rumors that Mary was not really pregnant and that the baby was to be smuggled into the room in a bedpan. The tradition continued well into the 20th century. The last royal birth to be witnessed by a government minister was that of Queen Elizabeth II's cousin, Princess Alexandra in 1936, and the practice was only officially halted shortly before the birth of Prince Charles in 1948.  The world is eagerly waiting to hear news of the birth of the royal baby. A royal source told CNN that the due date was Saturday, July 13, which would mean that the Duchess of Cambridge is several days overdue. Why is it taking the future prince or princess of Cambridge so long to arrive? First-born babies are less likely to arrive on time -- they're either too early or too late, studies have found.
