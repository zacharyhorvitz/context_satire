 A majority of Americans say they disapprove of President Donald Trump's handling of the situation in Charlottesville, Virginia, and believe his policies have done more to encourage racial division than racial unity, according to a new poll released Thursday. A CBS News survey found the majority of Americans polled (55%) said they disapproved of the President's response to the deadly violence that occurred at a white supremacist rally over the weekend, while most Republicans approved (67%). Just 10% of Democrats said they approved. Interviewing for this poll began the night before Trump's stunning news conference on Tuesday and continued for two nights after it.  About half of Americans (51%) have plans to watch the eclipse of the sun happening across the United States on August 21, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS. That figure climbs to 60% among those who live in states touched by the "zone of totality," where the moon will completely block the sun's light in the middle of Monday's solar spectacle. The survey was conducted in early August, and among those who already had plans in place, most said they were not going to travel for a better view. About four in 10 said their eclipse plans were to stay put, while 8% said they had made travel plans to view the "Eclipse of the Century."  Americans are drinking more. A lot more. According to a new study published in JAMA Psychiatry, an estimated one out of every eight Americans struggles with an alcohol disorder. The study tracked drinking patterns among 40,000 people between the years of 2002 and 2003, and then again from 2012 to 2013 to create a long-term picture of their habits.
