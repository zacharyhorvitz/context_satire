Hendrickson told TVSource magazine that she was "petrified" of filming the heavily emotional storyline. She stated, "I was just really intimidated because I don’t have a child. I’ve never experienced that unconditional love with someone – for someone  I really didn’t have that much to connect to in my own personal life. I think that’s what scared me the most – how I was going to find it within myself to tell a truthful story." As her story progresses following her constant manipulative behavior, Chloe reveals her true identity: Kate Valentine, the daughter of the Chancellor maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). The storyline was dubbed "Chloe is Kate". Hendrickson was pleased that the writers decided to give Chloe a backstory, saying, "I was so excited when I found out Chloe was going to have some family ties. I knew it would give me, as an actor, a chance to finally explain to viewers why Chloe is the way she is." In October 2013, Delia is killed in a hit and run accident. Hendrickson felt that it was hard to have her on-screen daughter die, but she was pleased to have an "emotional storyline" that you can "sink your teeth into", stating, "I had been wanting  for a long time, which I really haven’t had since  got cancer. So I was just happy to be a part of an emotional storyline that I was really excited to attempt and be challenged by as an actress." Moments before her death Billy left Delia alone in his car to buy ice-cream, but after her puppy Dash ran away, Delia followed.
