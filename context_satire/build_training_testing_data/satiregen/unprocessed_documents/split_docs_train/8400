 Singer Attrell Cordes of the music duo P.M. Dawn has died, the group said in a statement. He was 46. The singer and rapper, whose stage name was Prince Be, was one of two brothers who made up the R&B group. Jarrett has commented that his best performances have been when he has had only the slightest notion of what he was going to play at the next moment.

In the liner notes of the Bremen Lausanne album Jarrett states something to the effect that he is a conduit for the 'Creator', something his mother had apparently discussed with him.

"It's a real testament to the power of Muhammad Ali, his message and all he stood for that so many thousands showed up to be able to recognize him," Brian Eller told CNN affiliate WAVE-TV, leaving empty-handed after waiting in line for hours. Jeanne Stone told the TV station she traveled from Rochester, New York, for a chance to attend the memorial service in which former President Bill Clinton, comedian Billy Crystal and broadcaster Bryant Gumbel are among those scheduled to give eulogies.
