 An Electoral College tie. It's the white whale of American elections: elusive, mythical and never realized. But could it finally happen this year? The likelihood that President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will each net 269 electoral votes in November, instead of the 270 needed to win, is actually not so farfetched -- and for close observers of the Electoral College system, a tie would set off a wave of constitutional and political mayhem that would make the 2000 Florida recount seem like a tidy affair.  President Barack Obama's re-election campaign spent millions of dollars over the past few weeks in an advertising blitz  aimed at negatively defining GOP challenger Mitt Romney -- an effort that, according to several national polls and political experts, has met with tepid results. Those ads include a spot in heavy rotation with Romney singing "America the Beautiful" at a campaign event as out-of-context phrases from news reports such as "outsourced jobs to India" and "had millions in a Swiss bank account" appear on the screen. According to Vanderbilt University's Ad Rating Project, which polled 600 Democrats, Republicans and independents, 73% said the ad was "negative." More than half of independents polled said they disliked the ad.  Mitt Romney has a reputation for pragmatism, deliberation and playing it safe. But if Romney reveals his vice presidential pick this week, as the latest round of campaign chatter suggests, he'll be throwing out the traditional campaign playbook that says a running mate should be announced around a national party convention for maximum impact, just as voters are starting to pay attention to the campaign. Rarely has a presidential hopeful gone public with his running mate selection more than a week before his party's convention. Who will run with Romney?
