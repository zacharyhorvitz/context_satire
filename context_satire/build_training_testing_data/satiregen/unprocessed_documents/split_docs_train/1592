Sue Klebold, mother of Dylan Klebold, initially was in denial about Dylan's involvement in the massacre, believing he was tricked by Eric into doing it, among other things. Six months later, she saw the Basement Tapes made by Eric and Dylan, and acknowledged that Dylan was equally responsible for the killings. She spoke about the Columbine High School massacre publicly for the first time in an essay that appeared in the October 2009 issue of O: The Oprah Magazine. In the piece, Klebold wrote: "For the rest of my life, I will be haunted by the horror and anguish Dylan caused", and "Dylan changed everything I believed about myself, about God, about family, and about love." Marilyn Manson was blamed by the media in the wake of the Columbine shooting, and responded to criticism in an interview with Michael Moore, in which he was asked, "If you were to talk directly to the kids at Columbine and the people in the community, what would you say to them if they were here right now? ", to which he replied, "I wouldn't say a single word to them—I would listen to what they have to say, and that's what no one did." "I think this got made because Eric was in the right mood. He's an incredibly private man and despite his immense success, he's never cared if he got any publicity at all, he just loves his music ... I think it might be something to do with his age, as he turned 70 a couple of years ago. He said to me, "I didn't want it to be done after I was dead and for it to be wrong."
