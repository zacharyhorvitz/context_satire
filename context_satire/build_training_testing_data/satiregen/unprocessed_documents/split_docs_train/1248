 To work for President Donald Trump is to feel his wrath. That the White House -- or any White House -- would be the scene of internal debate or power struggles is hardly surprising. But while most presidents try to keep their distance from the daily drama, Trump seems to seek it out. Inside his motley administration, Trump is constantly judging, assessing and -- most colorfully -- complaining about his staff. The White House "beat" concept that had been started during the Cleveland administration by reporter William Price was continued during the McKinley administration. Around the time of the outbreak of the Spanishâ€“American War in 1898, the reporters covering the White House were invited into the mansion itself and provided with space to write, conduct interviews, and generally cover the White House. Now reporting from inside the White House, the reporters used their new location to interview guests entering or leaving the White House or confirm pieces of information from the president's secretaries as they passed through in the course of their duties. Reporters working in the White House did, however, honor an unspoken rule and refrain from asking the president himself a question if he happened to walk through their working area.  As his White House continued to struggle to get its story straight regarding the firing of FBI Director James Comey and the unwanted photo-op of the president and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak on Wednesday, Donald Trump took time out to troll longtime nemesis Rosie O'Donnell. On Thursday afternoon, Trump retweeted a two-word tweet the actress sent in December 2016 that read: "FIRE COMEY." He added this comment: "We finally agree on something Rosie." Reminder: Donald Trump is the president of the United States, the head of the US military and, arguably, the single most powerful person in the world.
