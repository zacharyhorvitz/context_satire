At the start of the 20th century there was a concern that Britain was falling behind Germany in scientific and technical education. A departmental committee was set up at the Board of Education in 1904, to look into the future of the Royal College of Science. A report released in 1906 called for the establishment of an institution unifying the Royal College of Science and the Royal School of Mines, as well as – if agreement could be reached with the City and Guilds of London Institute – their Central Technical College. The college was formed on July 1, 2006, with the merger of two former colleges; the College of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Sciences, and the College of Natural Resources, as well as the Department of Food Science and Nutrition. However, the origins of the college's programs extend back to 1869. In the 1950s, food science and technology became a subject in its own right. The UK National College of Food Technology was established in 1955 and food science degree courses began to be taught in four UK universities and one polytechnic. By the 1960s, food science and technology graduates and other scientists who were working with food felt the need for an institution that recognised the new discipline of food science and technology. The IFST was formed in 1964 to cater for this new breed of scientists and work began rapidly on creating and developing the new organisation.
