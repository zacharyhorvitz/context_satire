 In the days immediately following the death of our 41st President, the country gushed with celebrations of George H.W. Bush. Columnists and speakers, left and right, wrote and talked glowingly of the man, his contributions and especially his character. But soon after, a different narrative began to emerge.

"All of us should use every breath we have to make sure the lies stop on January 20, 2021," Comey told an audience at the 92nd Street Y on New York City's Upper East Side.

By party, a big majority of his Republican base approved (71%) compared to only 34% of independents and 14% of Democrats. Fifty-eight percent of Republicans said he'd been about right on handling Syria and a quarter thought he hadn't been tough enough.
