According to The Washington Post, the FBI "is building a vast repository controlled by people who work in a top-secret vault on the fourth floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington. This one stores the profiles of tens of thousands of Americans and legal residents who are not accused of any crime. What they have done is appear to be acting suspiciously to a town sheriff, a traffic cop or even a neighbor." In addition to the primary jurisdiction the FBI Police have at key FBI facilities, FBIP officials have stated that they have a memorandum of understanding agreement with the Metropolitan Police Department to patrol areas beyond their primary jurisdiction (in this case, beyond the 500Â ft radius around both the J. Edgar Hoover building and Washington field office in Washington, D.C.). When President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed, the jurisdiction fell to the local police departments until President Lyndon B. Johnson directed the FBI to take over the investigation. To ensure clarity about the responsibility for investigation of homicides of federal officials, the Congress passed a law that included investigations of such deaths of federal officials, especially by homicide, within FBI jurisdiction. This new law was passed in 1965.
