The Commonwealth Honors College Residential Community is a residence area reserved for members of the Commonwealth Honors College, completed in late 2013. Featuring six dormitory buildings, an advising center, offices, classrooms, and a cafe (Roots), it can house about 1,500 students. The area is bordered by the Recreation Center and Dickinson Hall to the north, Boyden Gym to the south, Tobin Hall and Goodell to the east, and Commonwealth Avenue on the west. Two halls, Sycamore and Oak, are designed to accommodate first-year students, and the other four halls, which contain suites and apartments, are designed as multi-year residence halls. The first dorm for women was the Abigail Adams House. Built in 1920, its name was the result of a contest to all women students of the college as well as all female high school students in the state. This dorm suffered a disastrous fire in 1962  (flames spread rapidly through combustible ceiling panels) and was converted to office use until being razed in 1967 to make way for the John W. Lederle Graduate Research Center, but another woman's dorm, Butterfield, would be named in honor of President Kenyon Butterfield, the college president in the early 1920s and one of the proponents of the Adams House at the time it was built. Central is organized into 4 clusters of buildings: Gorman-Wheeler and Brett-Brooks (Brett Brooks Website) at the bottom of the hill, Baker, Chadbourne and Greenough ("BCG") organized in a quad halfway up the hill, and Van Meter-Butterfield ("VMB") at the top of the hill. Gorman House was previously a building-wide Living Learning Community called NUANCE. Founded in 1989, it was a diversity awareness Living Learning Community. It also offered substance-free housing on its Wellness floor.
