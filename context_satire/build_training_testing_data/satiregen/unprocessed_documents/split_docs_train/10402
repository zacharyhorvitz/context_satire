The school is part of the Fresno Unified School District. Computech is located just south of the Edison High School. It was established in 1983 and buses students in from throughout Fresno. The school offers the Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program. Edison High School is located in Fresno, California, United States, as part of the Fresno Unified School District. It is a public high school located next to Computech Middle School. Founded c. 1906, the school was first named Edison Technical High School until a major renovation in the 1960s, when the name became the current Edison High School. In 1982â€“1983, Irwin Junior High School, located adjacent Edison High School was finally integrated by 1985, forming a larger campus; Edison Computech High School. Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Dade County was commended for its speed at rebuilding and reopening schools. Most schools reopened within two weeks of the storm, and students who attended schools that had been completely destroyed were quickly displaced with free and efficient bus transportation. The district also used funding from the disaster to redo its entire curriculum, adding sex education to elementary schools, and foreign language programs to middle schools. It opened fully funded magnet schools such as Coral Reef High School and Southwood Middle School, which take in students from all over the county based on school performance (some schools are partial magnets, which also enroll students from surrounding neighborhoods, while some are full magnets that only take students based on merit).
