 Something isn't adding up in the case of Michael Cohen and Sean Hannity. But Hannity's employer, Fox News, says it fully supports him. "While Fox News was unaware of Sean Hannity's informal relationship with Michael Cohen and was surprised by the announcement in court yesterday, we have reviewed the matter and spoken to Sean and he continues to have our full support," the network said Tuesday afternoon. The statement puts an end to questions about whether the network knew about Hannity and Cohen's legal relationship.  Moments before Sean Hannity's radio show started on Monday, an astonishing story broke: Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, revealed that Hannity was the third mystery client he had provided legal services to over the past year. The news jolted through the media industry, prompting reporters to send a flood of emails and texts to Hannity requesting comment. Hannity remarked that "everyone" was "going insane" and briefly teased journalists who had tuned into his radio program waiting for his reaction: "I'll just keep the media listening because they might learn something," he joked. Finally, the Fox News host, who is one of Trump's top defenders on cable news, addressed the elephant in the room, himself appearing a bit in the dark on what had just happened.  At most news organizations, Sean Hannity would face disciplinary action for having concealed a glaring conflict of interest from his viewers. Will that be the case at Fox News? The network won't say. Hannity was revealed on Monday as the third mystery client who had received legal services in the past year from Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's personal attorney.
