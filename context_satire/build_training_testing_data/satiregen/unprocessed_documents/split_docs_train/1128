In 1892, Candler set out to incorporate a second company; "The Coca-Cola Company" (the current corporation). When Candler had the earliest records of the "Coca-Cola Company" destroyed in 1910, the action was claimed to have been made during a move to new corporation offices around this time. Coca-Cola was the first commercial sponsor of the Olympic games, at the 1928 games in Amsterdam, and has been an Olympics sponsor ever since. This corporate sponsorship included the 1996 Summer Olympics hosted in Atlanta, which allowed Coca-Cola to spotlight its hometown. Most recently, Coca-Cola has released localized commercials for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver; one Canadian commercial referred to Canada's hockey heritage and was modified after Canada won the gold medal game on February 28, 2010 by changing the ending line of the commercial to say "Now they know whose game they're playing". Coca-Cola Amatil is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, however The Coca-Cola Company has a 30.8% shareholding in Coca-Cola Amatil, as it does with each of its primary or "anchor" bottlers in the worldwide Coca-Cola system. At the same time, Coca-Cola Amatil is joint owner with The Coca-Cola Company of Coca-Cola Bottling Indonesia (CCBI).
