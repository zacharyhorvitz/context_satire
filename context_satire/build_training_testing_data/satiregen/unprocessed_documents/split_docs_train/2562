Shortly after winning the Parola Sands Race, her grandson Alan Tracy picks her up so she can move to Tracy Island. Unfortunately, a racing competitor of Alan's takes revenge and Grandma finds herself having to sit still on a bridge spanning the San Miguel River with Alan due to a bomb that has been placed under the bridge to exact revenge. If either of them moved, the bomb would detonate. She and Alan are rescued by her grandsons, allowing Grandma to see first hand the work that her family did, and she moved into the Tracy home ("Move And You're Dead"). She was a prolific painter who generated over 1,500 canvasses in three decades. Moses initially charged $3 to $5 for a painting, depending upon its size, and as her fame increased her works were sold for $8,000 to $10,000. Her winter paintings are reminiscent of some of the known winter paintings of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, although she had never seen his work.

This was mainly due to people who had grown up eating grandma pizza finally being able to open up their own pizzerias and offer the pizza as a sign of respect and homage to what they ate.
