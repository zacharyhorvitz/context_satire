Members of the public can travel on the trains – usually during a tour of the Capitol Complex – but must be escorted by a staff member with proper identification. During votes, the House subway is restricted to congressional members. The Russell subway is restricted to members and staff during Senate votes. The neighborhood that is now called Capitol Hill started to develop when the government began work at two locations, the Capitol and the Washington Navy Yard. It became a distinct community between 1799 and 1810 as the federal government became a major employer. The first stage in its early history was that of a boarding house community developed for members of Congress. In the early years of the Republic, few Congressmen wished to establish permanent residence in the city.  The bitter Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle raged all over Capitol Hill on Thursday, even as his chances of reaching the Supreme Court appeared to improve after an FBI probe into allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Angry protests by anti-Kavanaugh campaigners mixed with deep mistrust festering between Republican and Democratic senators offered a glimpse of the political discord that will be the left behind if Republicans succeed in the long quest to elevate him to the court in the next few days. After a tense day on Capitol Hill, Kavanaugh's fate is not yet resolved, since three Republican swing senators who have been studying the FBI report have yet to indicate how they will vote, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can afford to lose only one of his troops. But Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who forced the supplemental FBI investigation following Christine Blasey Ford's emotional testimony against Kavanaugh last week in the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "we've seen no additional corroborating information" to support the allegations.
