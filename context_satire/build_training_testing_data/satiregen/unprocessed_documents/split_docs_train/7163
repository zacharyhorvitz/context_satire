Former Hatchet singer Danny Joe Brown, despite a long battle with diabetes and the effects of a stroke, was able to take the stage one last time at the Jammin' for DJB benefit concert organized by former Hatchet bassist Riff West on July 18, 1999 at Orlando, Florida's Club LaVela. With the help of his friends and former members Bruce Crump, Banner Thomas, Steve Holland and Dave Hlubek, he ended the show with "Flirtin' with Disaster". In the season 3 episode "Molly's New Shoes", the Peggy character reacts to her fiance's plans to retire and move to Arizona with the line: "Arizona? Why should I go to Arizona? It's nothing but a furnace full of drunk Indians." This prompted calls by the Native American Journalists Association, among others, for an apology. On July 8, 1990 Molly Hatchet, who had been dropped by RCA after Lighting Strikes Twice had failed to sell in big numbers, announced at a show in Toledo, Ohio that the concert would be their final one, that after that night the band would be disbanding.
