Davidson was born November 16, 1993, in Staten Island, New York, the son of Amy (n√©e Waters) and Scott Matthew Davidson. His father was of mostly Jewish heritage; his mother is of Irish ancestry; Davidson was raised Catholic. He has a younger sister named Casey. His father was a New York City firefighter who died in service during the September 11 attacks; he was last seen running up the stairs of the Marriott World Trade Center, just before it collapsed. Seeger lived in Beacon, New York. He remained engaged politically and maintained an active lifestyle in the Hudson Valley region of New York throughout his life. He and Toshi purchased their land in 1949 and lived there first in a trailer, then in a log cabin they built themselves. Toshi died in Beacon on July 9, 2013, at the age of 91, and Pete died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City on January 27, 2014, at the age of 94. Davidson first tried stand-up comedy at age 16 in a Staten Island bowling alley, where a group of friends, knowing of his comedy aspirations, dared him to take to the stage. He did so only after smoking marijuana. Davidson, who has suffered from Crohn's disease since the age of 17 or 18, at the time said he "cannot function" without marijuana, adding that he would not be able to work on Saturday Night Live, and that attempts to perform without it have not been successful. He explained that "I can perform when I'm not high, but it wouldn't be that much fun for me."
