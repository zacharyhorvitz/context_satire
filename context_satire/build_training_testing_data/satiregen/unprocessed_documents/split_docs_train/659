 Ted Cruz bowed out of the Republican presidential race Tuesday following a crushing loss to Donald Trump in Indiana, clearing the path for the real estate mogul to clinch the GOP nomination. It was a remarkable turn of events in a presidential primary race that seemed destined -- just weeks ago -- to end in a contested convention this summer. Even in the final hours of the race in the Hoosier State, Cruz insisted he was staying in the race until June 7 -- going so far as to attack his rival during a news conference as a "pathological liar" unfit for the White House. In the end, the growing strength of Trump's candidacy and Cruz's own stumbles in the past two weeks were too much for Cruz to overcome.  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will make "a major announcement" at 4 p.m. ET at the Pan American Pavilion in Indianapolis, he told reporters Wednesday morning. "We'll be making a major announcement so I encourage folks to come and join us," he said in a brief media availability outside his campaign bus. Cruz lost all five primaries held Tuesday but said he has been barnstorming Indiana in preparation for the Hoosier State's upcoming primary next week.  Ted Cruz formally named Carly Fiorina as his vice presidential running mate Wednesday -- a last-ditch move to regain momentum after being mathematically eliminated from winning the GOP presidential nomination outright. "After a great deal of consideration and prayer, I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated to be president of the United States that I will run on a ticket with my vice presidential nominee Carly Fiorina," Cruz said during a rally in Indianapolis. Fiorina joined the Texas senator on stage, and Cruz's staff changed the podium in between Cruz and Fiorina's remarks to display a new logo featuring both their names. "Ted could not be more right in what he said: There is a lot at stake, and in fact, this is a fight, this is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our nation," Fiorina said.
