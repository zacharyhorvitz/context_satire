 Like many things in life, it's going to get worse before it gets better. That lardy layer of humid, sticky heat oozing over the Northeast and Midwest is getting hotter and spreading out Thursday. But cooling rain will wash it away in some places in the evening. The worst of it started out on the National Weather Service map as bright orange spots over parts of New England and Michigan this week.  High temperatures forced Amtrak to keep the brake on rail speed in the Northeast on Friday, while a cold front bearing thunderstorms hinted at some relief from the Great Lakes to northern New England. Amtrak said the speed restrictions were necessary along rail lines between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, because of extreme heat that can distort tracks. Highs in the high 90s were forecast for Philadelphia on Friday. The National Weather Service said there was a slight risk of severe thunderstorms, damaging winds and hail from northern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin east to Maine.  Heat in the Northeast has taken at least six lives, health officials say. Five have died in Maryland over the course of the summer of heat-related causes; one man died last week in New York. A heat wave has been hanging over the northeast and the Midwest since early this week, driving up the heat index over 100 degrees in many places. Extreme heat can be a major cause of death, and health officials warn that the elderly, children and people with cardiovascular conditions stay cool and drink plenty of water.
