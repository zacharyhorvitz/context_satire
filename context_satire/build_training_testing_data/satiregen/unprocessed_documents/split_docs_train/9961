 A bear ate the corpse of a convicted killer in a wooded area of Canada, according to authorities. The mauled body of Rory Nelson Wagner, 53, was found in a rural area in southern British Columbia on Wednesday evening, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. Police believe Wagner was already dead in a 1986 Volkswagen Jetta when the black bear broke into the vehicle, ate some parts of him and dragged the rest of the body away. "The driver's window of the vehicle was down and investigators noted numerous muddy animal prints and scratches on the car," police said.  Police in Paris are searching for a self-proclaimed porn star suspected of killing and cutting up a university student in Canada, authorities in Montreal said Sunday. Police  Cmdr. Ian LaFreniere said sightings of the suspect, 29-year-old Luka Rocco Magnotta, are being investigated in Paris, but that he could be anywhere. Montreal authorities on Saturday detailed the charges pending against Magnotta, accusing him of first-degree murder in the grisly killing and dismembering of the student and threatening, among others, Canada's prime minister.  A malfunctioning jet engine on an Air Canada flight caused burning hot debris to fall to the ground after takeoff, an official with Canada's Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday. The incident Monday, which involved Air Canada Flight 001 bound for Tokyo from Toronto with 318 passengers and 16 crew members aboard, damaged vehicles on the ground and forced the Boeing 777 to return to Toronto. No injuries were reported. Don Enns, a regional manager at the independent Transportation Safety Board of Canada, told CTV and CP24 on Tuesday that "some sort of failure" inside one of the plane's two engines disrupted the airflow, causing part of the turbine section to fly out the back.
