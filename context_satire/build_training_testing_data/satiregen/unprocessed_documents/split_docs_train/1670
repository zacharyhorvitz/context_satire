Evan apologizes to Alana, but she has given up on Evan's help with The Connor Project as she doubts the truth of his statements that he was Connor's best friend. Evan shows her the letter to himself that he wrote when he was giving up on having a good year, claiming it to be Connor's suicide note. Realizing that the letter is the key to fulfilling the fundraising goal, Alana posts it online where, to Evan's chagrin, it goes viral. As a result, many people begin to believe Connor's suicide was because of his uncaring, wealthy parents ("You Will Be Found" (Reprise)). Evan is in an intense state of anxiety over what Connor might have done with the letter and tells Jared online about his assignment to write letters to himself ("Waving Through a Window" (Reprise #2)). Evan is called to the principal's office and is told by Connor's parents that Connor committed suicide days before, with Evan's letter found in his pocket, which they believe is a suicide note addressed to him. The wealthy Murphy family consists of the parents, Cynthia and Larry, and their children Zoe and Connor. Cynthia struggles with the fact that her family is falling apart, and the two mothers wonder how to connect with their sons  ("Anybody Have a Map? ").
