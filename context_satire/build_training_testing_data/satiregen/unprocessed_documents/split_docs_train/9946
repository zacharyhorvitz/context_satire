In "Facing Demons", the suicide of a 22-year-old man leads SVU to Gary Dolan (William Sadler), who molested the victim years before. While searching Dolan's apartment, Benson recognizes Cassidy as a boy in one of Dolan's photographs of the many Little League teams he coached. Benson reaches out to Cassidy to see if he has information about Dolan. Cassidy claims to know nothing, but after the visit, Benson gives an update on the case to Stone, who realizes Dolan must be Cassidy's abuser. Altheimer is served by the Dollarway School District. Students are zoned to James Matthews Elementary School, Robert F. Morehead Middle School, and Dollarway High School, all in Pine Bluff. In a Dolan article in The eXile about the newspaper and "the strange being known as the War Nerd" (mythologizing Brecher as a separate person to Dolan), Brecher is described as a community-college dropout, and "fat, miserable, and incidentally brilliant". The first hint that Brecher was Dolan was perhaps in a 2001 eXile article, "Cleanse the World", in which Dolan openly admitted to being a "war nerd": "Oh, my poor naive war-nerd brothers, how could you ever have dreamed that Bush."
