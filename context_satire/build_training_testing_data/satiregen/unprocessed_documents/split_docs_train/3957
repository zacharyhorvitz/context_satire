In 1945, George M. Harton III returned home from World War II. Harton was eager to join the family business at West View Park. Harton was then made president of T.M. Harton Company. In 2011, the National College for Teaching and Leadership announced Harton Academy as one of the first one hundred Teaching Schools to be designated from the start of 2011–2012 academic year; one of only five secondary schools in the north east, and one of only fifty-six secondary schools in the country, to receive the recognition. This new designation entitles the academy to lead the training and professional development of staff from across the North East region. The Socialist Party (SED) sends a married secretary Werner Horrath to oversee the plant and tame Balla's delinquent actions. Around the same time, Kati Klee (Krystyna Stypułkowska) arrives at the plant as an engineer who is first discouraged from working in an all-male environment. Balla doesn't like the Party control and in one important scene, Balla and Horrath play an aggressive clapping game, which eventually results in Horrath being pushed to the ground. Klee sees this and ultimately chooses Horrath to have a relationship with, though Balla has also been pursuing her.
