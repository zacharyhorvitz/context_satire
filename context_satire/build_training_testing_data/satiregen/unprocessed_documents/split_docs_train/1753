 In 2013, I wrote a story about how death benefits would not be paid to families who had lost their children in the Afghanistan war -- families which, overnight, had become Gold Star families -- because the government shutdown, then in place, meant there were no funds to fulfill this national obligation. America failed those serving it -- and their relatives. I mentioned the story to several people, and one of them told me it was very sad. But "this is what they signed up for," they said. In November 2018, Live Nation announced that the Jamboree in the Hills would be going on hiatus and would not take place in 2019 as it began negotiations regarding the event's future. Local officials in Belmont County noted that the site was atypical of Live Nation's other concerts and that the event's BYOB policy deprived Live Nation of a major source of revenue. Live Nation had attempted to end the BYOB policy for the 2017 event, which was to be renamed "Jambo Country," but fan backlash led to the reversal of the decision and renaming within days of its announcement. Rating it 3.5 out of 5 stars, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that "While Live in No Shoes Nation is quite slick in both its performance and production, part of its charm is that it's such a professional affair. Chesney may possess an unassuming voice and his songs, even the rocking ones, are laid-back, but he knows how to pump up a crowd."
