 In the first hour of former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Capitol Hill about the nature and details of his relationship with President Donald Trump, he called the president a liar twice. In his opening remarks, Comey flashed anger at Trump's characterization of him as unpopular among the rank and file of the FBI as well as the idea that the bureau was disorganized and chaotic. "Those were lies. Plain and simple," Comey said flatly.  President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday that he wishes fired FBI Director James Comey luck ahead of his Thursday Senate testimony. "I wish him luck," Trump said when asked what message he had for Comey. The former FBI director's testimony is expected to focus on the his interactions with Trump and a series of memos he kept about conversations he had with the President. The comment came during a meeting with congressional leadership, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, where the group is slated to discuss Trump's stalled agenda on Capitol Hill.  President Donald Trump claimed "total and complete vindication" the day after former FBI Director James Comey testified on Capitol Hill, tweeting his first response to the bombshell testimony after spending all of Thursday off his social media site of choice. Trump's comment tracks with Republican talking points about the hearing, where the Republican National Committee and White House urged surrogates to emphasize the fact that Comey clearly said the President was never an explicit subject of the Russia probe during his time at the FBI. But Comey's testimony about the President was also damaging. The former FBI director said Trump's private comments urging him to drop the probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn led him to tell his Justice Department colleagues they needed to be careful.
