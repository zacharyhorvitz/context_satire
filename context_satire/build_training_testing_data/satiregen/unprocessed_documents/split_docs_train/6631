 We know that those who forget their history are doomed to repeat it. Yet that sentiment has been lost in the politicized attempts to fight President Barack Obama's push to accept more Syrian refugees. Our state and national leaders would do well to remember a tragic incident from our past in which people fleeing from danger in their country were denied a compassionate response by ours. In May, 1939, a few months before the German invasion of Poland and the start of World War II, nearly 1,000 German Jews approached South Florida aboard a ship called St. Louis.  President Barack Obama on Thursday dismissed Donald Trump's plan to enlist a "deportation force" to rid the country of undocumented immigrants, saying it was infeasible, bad optics and contrary to U.S. values. "Imagine the images on the screen flashed around the world as we were dragging parents away from their children, and putting them in detention centers, and then systematically sending them out," Obama said during an interview with ABC News. "Nobody thinks that that is realistic," he added. "But more importantly, that's not who we are as Americans."  That the first blasts of last Friday's attacks in Paris were heard outside Stade de France should not be a surprise. The French were hosting a "friendly" against Germany, with President Francois Hollande sitting among the passionate soccer fans. From the massacre of the Israeli team at the Munich Olympic Games in 1972 to the cancellation of the Dakar Rally in 2008 to the attack on the Boston Marathon in 2013, sporting events have been prime targets for terror for decades. Tuesday, Germany canceled its own friendly against the Netherlands, citing "concrete intelligence" of potential bombs.
