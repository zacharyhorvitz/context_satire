The track was recorded on 11 September 1977 for Crosby's television special, Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas, which was to be his last. The framing device is that the butler Hudson, portrayed along with other characters during the show by Stanley Baxter, who is not seen as he is always changing ("He does that a lot. "), lets Bowie use his piano, and that Crosby is the poor American cousin. The intergenerational pair exchange scripted dialogue about what they each do on their respective family Christmases and on parenthood, banter about the old vis-Ã -vis the new and agents sliding down the chimney, and then proceed to musical subjects, with Bowie remarking that he likes old-timers such as John Lennon and Harry Nilsson ("You go back that far!" Participation is automatic, although reporting of losses and wins is voluntary. Winning requires not hearing even a snippet of "The Little Drummer Boy" between Black Friday and Christmas Eve inclusive, the only exception being that being deliberately ambushed by someone singing or playing the song results in a loss for the offender, not the victim. On the other hand, as of 2017 players may not harass musicians in advance to keep them from playing the song. Parodies of the song, as of 2018, will also cause elimination per the "blurred lines rule." The romantic idea about drummers is that they were young boys (for instance the Christmas carol "The Little Drummer Boy", or the painting "Steady the Drums"). The fact, though, is that drummers were more often adult men, recruited like the common soldiers. Fifers, on the other hand, being not an official part of the regiments early on, were usually recruited from young boys. During the second half of the 19th century, it was accepted in many western armies that under aged boys served as drummers.
