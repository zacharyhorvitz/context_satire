Dwight David Eisenhower High School (/ˌaɪzɪnˈhaʊ.ər/) is located  in Yakima, Washington, United States. It is named after U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower. It is one of five high schools in the Yakima School District, the others being Davis High School, Stanton Academy, Yakima Online, and Yakima Valley Technical Skills Center (YV-Tech). Students and community members often refer to the school as "Ike." North Yakima High School (which was renamed Davis High School in 1957 when Eisenhower High School became the second senior high school in Yakima) began classes in 1884, and was housed in the Columbia Building. By 1896, the school's enrollment reached 40 students and classes were relocated to the Central School Building. With an ever-increasing student body, in 1900, the school was once-again relocated to the Lincoln School. In 1905, land was procured on South 7th Avenue and Walnut, with plans to build a new, larger high school. Yakima Valley College (YVC) is one of the oldest community colleges in the state of Washington. Founded in 1928, YVC is a public, four-year institution of higher education, and part of one of the most comprehensive community college systems in the nation. It offers programs in adult basic education, English as a Second Language, lower-division arts and sciences, professional and technical education, transfer degrees to in-state universities, and community services.
