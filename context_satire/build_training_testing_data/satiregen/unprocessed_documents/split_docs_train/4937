The duties of the secretary revolve around human conditions and concerns in the United States. This includes advising the president on matters of health, welfare, and income security programs. The Secretary strives to administer the Department of Health and Human Services to carry out approved programs and make the public aware of the objectives of the department.  Eager to highlight signs of an economy on the rebound, President Barack Obama launched a midterm election effort Thursday designed to convince voters of a vigorous recovery that a majority still doubts. At stake: the power to get anything done in Washington during the final quarter of his presidency. "I want people the know there are some really good things happening in America," Obama declared at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management in Chicago, both summarizing his election-year pitch and capturing the political problem inherent in having to describe an economic recovery that many Americans still aren't feeling. "Sometimes the noise clutters and I think confuses the nature of the reality out there," he said before listing his economic achievements, including bailing out the American automobile sector and reducing the rolls of people without health insurance. The United States Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), also known as the Health Department, is a cabinet-level department of the U.S. federal government with the goal of protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services. Its motto is "Improving the health, safety, and well-being of America". Before the separate federal Department of Education was created in 1979, it was called the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). HHS is administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
