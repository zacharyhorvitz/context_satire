Theorists have argued from the earliest days of discussion of Balanced Scorecard usage that much of the benefit of the balanced scorecard comes from the design process itself. Indeed, it is argued that many failures in the early days of balanced scorecard could be attributed to this problem, in that early balanced scorecards were often designed remotely by consultants â€“ it is suggested that by not being involved in the design, the relevant managers who were to use the device did not trust, and so failed to engage with and use the devices. Both Vanity Fair and the New York Post have announced the completion by the playwright and dramatist David Mamet of the play titled Bitter Wheat which is to deal principally with the Weinstein controversy concerning his arrest in 2018. As stated in the New York Post in May 2018: "The plan is to open Mamet's new play in London...sources say Mamet is wary of another run at Broadway unless his Weinstein play gets a good reception in England. He's got a shot with Daniel Evans, the young director who's in talks to do it". As detailed in Erik Larson's popular history The Devil in the White City, extraordinary effort was required to accomplish the exposition, and much of it was unfinished on opening day. The famous Ferris Wheel, which proved to be a major attendance draw and helped save the fair from bankruptcy, was not finished until June, because of waffling by the board of directors the previous year on whether to build it. Frequent debates and disagreements among the developers of the fair added many delays. The spurning of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show proved a serious financial mistake.
