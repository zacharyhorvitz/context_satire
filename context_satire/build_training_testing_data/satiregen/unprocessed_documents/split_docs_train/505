 Donald Trump has finally hired someone he can't fire. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee ended days of intense speculation and political drama on Friday, officially announcing via Twitter that he has chosen Indiana Gov. Mike Pence to be his vice presidential nominee -- a decision that pairs up two men whose personalities are day and night. Famously brash and unfiltered, Trump has shocked the country throughout the election with his boisterous, and at times, colorful rhetoric.  Last month, Vanity Fair reported that Donald Trump was eyeing a plan to launch his own news organization. If Trump needed a model for this new media project, he might have found it in none other than Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the man he announced Friday as his running mate. Trump's motivation, according to Vanity Fair, was primarily financial: Media organizations had been making bank covering his campaign and he wanted a cut.  Donald Trump said Friday Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is his choice to be his running mate. "I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M.," the presumptive Republican nominee tweeted.
