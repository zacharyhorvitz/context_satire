Santiago was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico and raised in Manhattan, New York. In the early 1950s Santiago and friends, 2nd tenor Jimmy Merchant, fellow Puerto Rican Joe Negroni a baritone, and bassman Sherman Garnes, would meet in front of Santiago's apartment stoop (building stairs) and sing songs to the beat of the Doo-Wop genre. They originally called themselves the "Ermines" and Santiago was their lead singer. On one occasion the "Ermines" participated in a talent show at PS 143 (Public School 143), at which another group, "The Cadillacs" were guests. The Spenglerâ€“Thomas Building is a historic 2-story brick commercial building in Jackson, Mississippi. It was built in 1909 and was home to Bowers Brothers Dry Goods in 1910, then Maloney Brothers Dry Goods and Grocery which was joined by S.N. Thomas Department Store on one side of the building. Southern Business College and a Masonic Lodge were located upstairs by 1917. In December 1992, the U.S. federal court ruled that the rights to the song belonged to Herman Santiago and that Jimmy Merchant and Emira Lymon (the true widow) were also entitled to receive royalties dating back to 1969. Herman Santiago was by now homeless and living in a car when he received the news and soon went from being homeless to becoming a millionaire.
