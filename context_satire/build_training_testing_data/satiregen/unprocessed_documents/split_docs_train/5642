After the death of Jackie Aprile, Jr., Janice embarks on a clandestine relationship with Ralph Cifaretto in season four who is in a relationship with Jackie's mother, Rosalie Aprile. With the help of her feminist therapist, Janice soon reaches the conclusion that her affair with Ralph is a mistake, and after Ralph happily tells her that he is no longer seeing Rosalie Aprile and plans to move in with her; Janice responds by flying into a rage, pushing him down a flight of stairs and screaming at him to leave. Sometime later, Tony asks Janice about Ralph's bizarre sexual fetishes, of which he had recently become aware. She refuses to tell him anything at first, ostensibly to protect Ralph's privacy. Janice suggests to Tony that he help pay to keep Uncle Junior — whose money has run out — in a private care facility, but is rebuffed by Tony, who makes it clear Junior is dead to him. Angered by Janice and Bobby's perceived disloyalty, Tony tells her that he is also going to exile Bobby from his life, although this is just an empty threat. He angrily confides to Dr. Melfi that Janice "gets nothing" because she didn't have the scars he did from having to deal with and take care of their mother alone while Janice left New Jersey as soon as she graduated high school. Later in the episode, Tony lets go of his hostility and compensates Janice and Bobby by convincing an imprisoned John Sacrimoni to sell them his large house at half price. Tony also grows closer to Bobby, with Tony entrusting him with more responsibility and Bobby becoming a trusted money maker as a result.
