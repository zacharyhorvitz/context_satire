 President Barack Obama offers a better path forward for the country that will promote united values rather than the winner-takes-all mentality of Republicans, former President Bill Clinton told the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night. In a highly anticipated speech before Obama was formally nominated for re-election, Clinton framed the November vote as a choice of what kind of country Americans want. "If you want a winner-take-all, you're-on-your-own society, you should support the Republican ticket," Clinton said. "If you want a country of shared prosperity and shared responsibility -- a we're-all-in-this-together society -- you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden."  In Tampa this week, it's not just Republicans in town for the convention. Over the next few days, you'll see a lot of Democratic faces in Florida, dogging and counter-pointing the GOP's every move. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, national co-chair for the Obama Campaign and chairmain for the Democratic National Convention next week in Charlotte, is one of those Democratic voices in Tampa. He says his presence at the RNC is to remind voters what Republicans said during the primary season.  1) Where is Obama's Second Term Agenda? -- President Barack Obama's Thursday night nomination speech, now being held in the tight Time Warner Cable Arena due to weather concerns, needs to lay out a specific second-term agenda. For Obama, simply promising more of the same isn't enough to earn re-election. He's got to lay out a specific contrasting plan with some new details, because the curse of being Barack Obama is that giving a great speech isn't good enough anymore.
