In January 2018, YouTube creator Logan Paul faced criticism for a video he had uploaded from a trip to Japan, where he encountered a body of a suicide death in the Aokigahara forest. The corpse was visible in the video, although its face was censored. The video proved controversial due to its content, with its handling of the subject matter being deemed insensitive by critics. On January 10—eleven days after the video was published—YouTube announced that it would cut Paul from the Google Preferred advertising program.   President Barack Obama was delivering a speech before a joint session of Congress when a white lawmaker jabbed his right index finger at Obama and called him a liar. The heckling came during his September 2009 address on health care. Obama was telling lawmakers that his plan wouldn't cover undocumented immigrants when Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina yelled, "You lie!" Linnyette Richardson-Hall, an African-American event planner, watched Wilson's outburst on live television in disbelief.  When will the violence stop? This is the question for which long-time national civil rights icon and Congressman John Lewis is demanding an answer. No, it was no stunt. Just as he defiantly marched across the Pettus Bridge 51 years ago to demand voting rights for black Americans, he and a cohort of colleagues have defiantly demanded the right to safety in their nation.
