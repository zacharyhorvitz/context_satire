The game's development was complete before the World Wrestling Federation's lawsuit with the World Wildlife Fund, however it was released afterwards, causing the packaging to be initially released with the unabbreviated "World Wrestling Federation" before changing to feature the new World Wrestling Entertainment logo. Although the packaging and paraphernalia feature the WWE logo, the actual game still contains the WWF logo. By March 2019, Marvel Studios was planning to create an animated series based on the What If concept from the comics for Disney+. The anthology series, which is not canon to the MCU, explores how the MCU would be altered if certain events had occurred differently, such as if Loki wielded Thor's hammer. The series will star Jeffrey Wright as the voice of Uatu / The Watcher, with many of the actors from the films also voicing their respective characters. A.C. Bradley serves as the head writer of What If...?, with Bryan Andrews directing the series. The company is headed by Turnberry Principal, Jeffrey Soffer, PLANTworldwide owner Brett Plant, and former Mandalay Resort Group President, Glenn Schaeffer. The company currently has several ongoing hotel and condominium development projects in Miami Beach and Las Vegas, with several more on the way, and Schaeffer has suggested that Fontainebleau will go public in order to raise money for their multibillion-dollar development plans.
