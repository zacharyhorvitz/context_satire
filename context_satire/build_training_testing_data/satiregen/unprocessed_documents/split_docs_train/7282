Detective Jay Halstead previously appeared on Chicago Fire as an undercover cop assigned to shadow and take down a local mobster-cum-thug who was harassing Gabriela Dawson, one of the owners of Molly's bar. He requests a transfer to the Intelligence Unit after the assignment ended with him getting shot but successfully arresting the mobster. Chicago P.D. begins a month following his transfer.  You are not supposed to approach the car. You are supposed to ask the driver to get out. Well, two of the cops ran up ahead and opened the passenger side door. The other  was on the other side, yelling at Russ to open the door. 2016's surge in murders and shootings, coupled with a decline in gun seizures, led former Police Superintendent John Escalante to express concerns in March 2016 that officers might be hesitant to engage in proactive policing due to fear of retribution. Officers anonymously reported to the Chicago Sun-Times that they have been afraid to make investigatory stops because the Justice Department and American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois have been scrutinizing police practices. Data of the supposed pullback was reflected with an 80 percent decrease in the number of street stops that officers made since the beginning of 2016. Dean Angelo has claimed that part of the problem is politicians and groups like the ACLU who don't know much about policing, and yet are "dictating what police officers do".
