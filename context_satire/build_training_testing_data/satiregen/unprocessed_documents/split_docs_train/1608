The Stanford Graduate School of Business is the most selective business school in the United States. It has maintained the highest ratio of "applicants to available seats" of any business school in the U.S. for the last decade. It has also had the lowest acceptance rates (typically <7%) of any business school. For the Class of 2018 which entered in 2016, 6% of applicants were offered admission, and the average GMAT score of 737 and average GPA of 3.73 are the highest of any business school in the United States. In 1958, Arbuckle was asked to become dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He held this post for ten years, finally leaving in 1968. During his time as dean, the Stanford Graduate School of Business rose to prominence as one of the best business schools in the United States. In 1968, the Ernest C. Arbuckle Award was created to award the graduate of the Stanford Graduate School of Business who had demonstrated excellence in the field of leadership management. The business school pioneered the development of the case method of teaching, drawing inspiration from this approach to legal education at Harvard. Cases are typically descriptions of real events in organizations. Students are positioned as managers and are presented with problems which they need to analyse and provide recommendations on.
