Luke Haggerty is one of the castaways and the unofficial leader of the group. After he was wrongly convicted for possession of a firearm, he is forced to decide between serving time in a juvenile detention center or enrollment in the Charting a New Course program. He is confident and decisive, but prone to angry outbursts. He clashes violently throughout the series with J.J. Lane. J.J., or Jonathan Junior, is the son of the famous Hollywood actor Jonathan Lane and the oldest of the castaways. He is enrolled in the Charting a New Course program after he performs a series of stunts, one more outrageous than the last. By his own admission, he performed said stunts to get his father's attention. For most of the series, he believes that the unfortunate events that have befallen them are an elaborate trick to teach them the error of their ways. Jack is told that the boy will be released only if he signs a contract giving his partnership share to Wayne, Buck, Sokoloff, and Haggerty (Buck & Wayne stand by sheepishly, though have little say in the matter). Jack signs the agreement, realising this is just the lucky break he needed to exit the situation, so asks to backdate the contract six months, claiming he wants to avoid all the unnecessary taxes. Just as Haggerty is boasting his triumph over Jack, Sokoloff surprises him with a bullet in his back, deeming him too untrustworthy for partnership. He lets Jack go however, in recognition of all the money he has made him; "Sometimes business is more important than family", he smirks.
