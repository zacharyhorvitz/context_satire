 The White House would be open to having Deborah Ramirez, the second woman to publicly accuse Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. "Certainly we would be open to that and that process could take place on Thursday," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on ABC News' "Good Morning America" Tuesday morning. "The President's been clear: Let's let them speak," Sanders said. "But let's also let Brett Kavanaugh speak, and let's let him tell his side of the story before we allow allegations to determine his entire future."  Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh claimed in an interview Monday night with Fox News' Martha MacCallum that he was a virgin through high school and for many years after. He also said he wants a fair process through which he can defend himself against allegations of sexual assault and other sexually inappropriate behavior that have been made against him. The former we could go without hearing; the latter goes without saying. But this is where we are.  Allies of Brett Kavanaugh are touting the performance the Supreme Court nominee and his wife gave Monday evening on Fox News as accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior from high school and college continue to threaten his nomination. The unprecedented decision to put a Supreme Court nominee in front of a camera before his confirmation came as the White House and outside groups work to put Kavanaugh in a stronger position ahead of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both high school students, will also testify. President Donald Trump took perhaps his most aggressive stand in defense of Kavanaugh to date on Tuesday, when he cast doubt on the recollections of both the women accusing Kavanaugh and slammed Democrats for playing what he described as a "con game."
