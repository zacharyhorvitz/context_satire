Violet Harmon (portrayed by Taissa Farmiga as teenage Violet, Carmen Blanchard as young Violet) is the teenage daughter of Ben and Vivien Harmon, who is initially unhappy about moving to Los Angeles. In the pilot episode, Violet befriends Tate Langdon, one of her father's patients, and the two eventually start dating. She later discovers that he is in fact a ghost who died in the house after committing a mass shooting at her school in 1994. Before making this discovery, her and Tate go on a date on halloween night, only to be confronted by many of the ghosts of the students he murdered in the shooting. She returns in the eighth season, Apocalypse. Following the events of "Afterbirth", Constance began noticing violent psychopathic tendencies in Michael, beginning with the killing of insects to eventually murdering his nanny at the age of three. One day, she entered Michael's bedroom to discover he had aged ten years overnight and now had the appearance of a teenager. When Constance was almost strangled to death by Michael in her sleep, she consulted the help of a Catholic priest, only for him to be murdered by Michael. Constance Langdon (portrayed by Jessica Lange) is the next door neighbor of the Harmons, and a former resident of the house, who is determined to steal one of Vivien's twins and raise him as her own. Constance had four children: Tate, Adelaide, Beauregard, and Rose (the last of whom is unnamed and unseen until Apocalypse). She tells Vivien that her womb is "cursed" because three of her four children were born with a genetic defect, and they have all died aside from Adelaide. Constance originally moved from Virginia to California in order to become a movie star, but she was against nudity so her career never took off.
