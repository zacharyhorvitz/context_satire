Conversely, her next appearance was so successful that it led one journalist to write "Emma Thompson is back, firing on all cylinders." Saving Mr. Banks depicted the making of Mary Poppins, and starred Thompson as P. L. Travers, curmudgeonly author of the source novel. The actress considered it to be the best script she had read in years and was delighted to be offered the role. She considered it to be the most challenging of her career because she had "never really played anyone quite so contradictory or difficult before", but found the inconsistent and complicated character "a blissful joy to embody". Thompson is the second daughter of actress Phyllida Law, the presenter of the first TV show broadcast on BBC Two, Play School, and actor Eric Thompson, the writer–narrator of the popular children's television series The Magic Roundabout on BBC One in the 1960s. She is the younger sister of actress and screenwriter Emma Thompson. In the week after graduating herself from the Central School of Speech and Drama in London, she took the name Emma Stansfield under Equity rules (as actress Emma Thompson had already registered the name), and landed a role in the teenage play Sparkleshark. Stansfield guest starred in the television series Holby City and The Royal, and then made her West End Theatre debut in Andrew Lloyd Webber's production of Daisy Pulls It Off.
