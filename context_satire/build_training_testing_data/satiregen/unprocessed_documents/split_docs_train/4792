In 1975, Monday night would be family night at the Kon Tiki and had entertainment aimed at the young. There was also a floor show which had Polynesian acts performing native fire-knife dances and dancing hula girls. Along the way they find Patrick Danville, a young man imprisoned by someone who calls himself Joe Collins but is really a psychic vampire named Dandelo. Dandelo feeds off the emotions of his victims, and starts to feed off of Roland and Susannah by telling them jokes. Roland and Susannah are alerted to the danger by Stephen King, who drops clues directly into the book, enabling them to defeat the vampire. They discover Patrick in the basement, and find that Dandelo had removed his tongue. When Gantt returned from the War, he moved to Hawaii and opened Waikiki Beach, one of the two archetypal tiki bars. The bar was designed to evoke the South Pacific, with palm trees, tiki masks on the walls, a garden hose that showered a gentle rain on the roof and a myna bird that was trained to shout "Give me a beer, stupid!" The bar was located on the beach, lit by tiki torches outside which enhanced its primitive ambiance. A Don the Beachcomber was located at Waikiki's International Market Place.
