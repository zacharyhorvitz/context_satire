That night, Jason plans on telling Shadia who he really is, but before he can, Cody does an online search on him and tells Shadia that Jason is already engaged. Jason then gets caught with drugs and is thrown into jail again. The next day, Dick bails him out and tells Jason that his real reason for the trip was to convince Jason not to go through with the wedding. Jason leaves Dick and drives back home.  The President's two unscripted appearances before the press here Thursday revealed a commander in chief with a well of pent up opinions looking for an escape. As Donald Trump's presidency enters a new phase -- with an order-minded chief of staff and a West Wing reorganization on the horizon -- the President seemed eager to return to the looser style that helped him win. In Washington, the President has been loathe to engage in public with reporters. He departed the White House last week having held fewer solo news conferences than any of his recent predecessors. Yarvin came to public attention in February 2017 when Politico magazine reported that Steve Bannon, who served as White House Chief Strategist under U.S. President Donald Trump, read Yarvin's blog and that Yarvin "has reportedly opened up a line to the White House, communicating with Bannon and his aides through an intermediary". The story was picked up by other magazines and newspapers, including The Atlantic, The Independent, and Mother Jones. Yarvin jokingly told The Atlantic that his White House contact was the Twitter user Bronze Age Pervert, though to Vox he denied being in contact with Bannon in any way. Yarvin later gave a copy of Bronze Age Pervert's book Bronze Age Mindset to Michael Anton, a former senior national security official in the Trump administration.
