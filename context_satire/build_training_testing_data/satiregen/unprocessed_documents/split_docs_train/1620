 Americans' confidence in the economy is sinking. It's at its lowest level so far in 2016, according to the weekly survey known as the Gallup U.S. Economic Confidence Index. In fact, people's perceptions of the economy haven't been this poor since late August when stock markets around the world were crashing and there were fears China might be slipping into a deep downturn. It was clear why people were anxious in August.  Primary turnout is way up this year compared with 2012. According to a recent Pew study, it's on pace to rival 2008's record of 30.4 percent. Still, less than a third of Americans will take part in the process. That doesn't mean they don't want to show off their participation.  When Americans experience health problems, they don't just rely on doctors and medications. A new study found that most Americans have turned to prayer to heal themselves and others. The study found that about nine out of 10 Americans have relied on healing prayer at some point in their lives, with most of them praying for other people's health and well-being more than their own. "It was very surprising," said the study's author, Jeff Levin, professor of epidemiology and population health at Baylor University.
