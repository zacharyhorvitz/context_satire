Denise (Lauren Lapkus) is the assistant manager at Stuart's comic book store introduced in season 10. She is quite a comic book geek. At first, Sheldon doesn't like the change that her hiring brings to the store, but starts to like her because of her comic book knowledge and her ability to figure out his preferences in comic books. After being annoyed by Sheldon's praising of Denise, Amy goes down to the bookstore to demand that Denise teach her enough about comics to make it appear that she likes them. In season twelve episode "The D&D Vortex", Wheaton as Professor Proton invites Sheldon to meet William Shatner, and Sheldon gets so excited that he then proceeds to throw up on him. When Sheldon shows up at Wheaton's house to apologize, Wheaton accepts the apology, but as he is in the middle of a private Dungeons & Dragons game featuring William Shatner, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kevin Smith, Joe Manganiello and Stuart, he shuts Sheldon out. When the guys find out about the game, they get Stuart to quit and Wheaton invites Leonard, asking him not to tell anyone. Leonard then tells Penny and she tells Amy and Bernadette; the girls stalk Wheaton in an attempt to get themselves invited when they hear that Manganiello from Magic Mike will be there. In season eleven, Sheldon wants to replace Arthur Jeffries in the role of Professor Proton, following Jeffries' death, and asks Wheaton to be his acting coach for the part. However, when Wheaton somehow gets the part instead, Sheldon is dismayed and after many unsuccessful attempts to get his friends to boycott the franchise, he demands that Wheaton turn down the role. Wheaton refuses, claiming he wants to inspire young scientists and Sheldon begins to consider him an enemy again. However, after watching the show Sheldon likes Wheaton's portrayal of Prof. Proton and gets jealous when he sees that Wheaton has brought Howard to be a guest on his show.
