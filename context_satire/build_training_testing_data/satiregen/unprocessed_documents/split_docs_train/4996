 Hillary Clinton was defiant Monday about the FBI's examination of a new batch of emails that might be related to her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, saying at a campaign rally, "There is no case here." "I am sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrong doing with just days to go," Clinton said. "That is a good question." The Democratic Party's presidential nominee added she felt confident that the FBI would reach the "same conclusion" as before: "There is no case here."  John Podesta is turning up the heat on FBI Director James Comey to release more details about the bureau's review of new emails possibly tied to Hillary Clinton's private server. In an interview Sunday with CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union," the Clinton campaign chairman complained the FBI should have investigated enough to know exactly what it was dealing with before announcing the review. "He might have taken the first step of actually having looked at them before he did this in the middle of a presidential campaign, so close to the voting," Podesta said. Comey's Friday notification to Congress of the review is rocking the final days of the presidential race. In early October 2016, FBI criminal investigators working on a case involving former Congressman Anthony Weiner allegedly sending sexually explicit texts to a fifteen-year-old girl discovered emails from Weiner's estranged wife, Huma Abedin, vice chair of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, that they considered potentially relevant to the Clinton server investigation. FBI officials reportedly decided to disclose the development despite its potential effect on the pending presidential election to preempt the possibility that it would be leaked in another way.
