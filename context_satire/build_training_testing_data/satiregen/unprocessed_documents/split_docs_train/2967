On 18 February 2017, McLoughlin released a video called "Let's Talk!" to his YouTube channel which discussed PewDiePie being cut from Maker Studios for his use of anti-Semitic imagery. In it, he clarified that while he had tweeted in support of PewDiePie he did not condone his actions and believed he could have been more apologetic. Overall, McLoughlin states, "You can still be friends with someone but not agree with something they do. Kjellberg originally registered a YouTube account under the name "Pewdie" in 2006; he explained that "pew" represents the sound of lasers and "die" refers to death. After forgetting the password to this account, he registered the "PewDiePie" YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. Following his exit from Chalmers, his parents refused to financially support him, and as a result, he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. Kjellberg stated that the ability to make videos was more important to him than a prestigious career. McLoughlin joined YouTube on 24 February 2007 but didn't start uploading videos until November 2012 when he started to work on his channel under the name "jacksepticeye", posting gameplay videos. The origin of the name "jacksepticeye" started with his mother, who has always called him Jack, as it's a popular nickname for Sean in Ireland. A childhood friend found out about this and started to also call him Jack as a joke. One day he was playing football and he got accidentally hit in the eye, hard enough that it started bleeding.
