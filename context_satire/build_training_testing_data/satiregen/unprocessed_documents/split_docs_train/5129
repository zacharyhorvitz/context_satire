Levine founded his own record label, 222 Records in February 2012. He stated that he was inspired to start the label to sign on Rozzi Crane, an USC music student he discovered through a mutual friend. She became the first singer signed on to the label, followed by Glee actor Matthew Morrison and The Voice season 2 contestant and part of Team Adam, the singer Tony Lucca. It was reported that he was negotiating further with potential distributors, as well as organizing staff, to operate as a full-fledged record company with departments such as marketing, radio and publicity. In 2009, Play was reported to have reunited, without original member Anna Sundstrand. Two weeks before they were scheduled to go back into the studio, member Rosanna Munter decided not to continue with the group, saying in a statement she "has worked hard on my own music, and I want to give it the chance to be heard.". The group continued as a trio with Faye Hamlin, Ana√Øs Lameche, and a new member, Sanne Karlsson via the popular Swedish television program, Made in Sweden. The group achieved a number one single with "Famous" and a top ten album, Under My Skin in Sweden. New Orleans agreed to commission the waterworks project in 1811, although Latrobe was not ready to take on the project immediately and faced financial problems in securing enough investors for the project. His work on the United States Capitol was completed shortly before the War of 1812 started, ending his source of steady income. During the war Latrobe unsuccessfully tried several wartime schemes to make money, including some steamboat projects. In 1814, Latrobe partnered with Robert Fulton in a steamship venture based at Pittsburgh.
