On November 16, 2019, Bernie Sanders and other 2020 Presidential candidates participated in a Presidential Town Hall at the California Democratic Party Convention. Neither Joe Biden nor Elizabeth Warren attended the convention nor participated in the town hall. Following the event, supporters of Bernie Sanders celebrated his campaign for Medicare for All and a Green New Deal in the lobby of the convention hall, where Bernie Sanders banners were draped over the railings. The Democratic Party's fourth presidential debate was held on Tuesday October 15, 2019 in Westerville, Ohio, from 8 to 11 p.m. EDT. On September 27, the DNC announced that the debate would include all 12 candidates on one night, although some had assumed it would take place on two nights since it had more than 10 participants. From left to right, the candidates were: Gabbard (who missed the previous debate), Steyer (in his first debate), Booker, Harris, Sanders, Biden and Warren (who shared center stage), Buttigieg, Yang, O'Rourke, Klobuchar, and Castro. Podium order for the debate was determined based on an average of the 10 most recently released qualifying polls. The candidates who qualified were Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and Yang. Highlights included: an exchange between Buttigieg, Warren, and Sanders about campaign financing (including mention of a Buttigieg fundraiser in a Napa Valley wine cave), differences between Klobuchar and Buttigieg on the issue of experience, and a discussion about health care between Sanders and Biden. The candidates were in agreement about the impeachment of Donald Trump, which had been approved by the House of Representatives the day before. Sanders and Klobuchar had a disagreement about the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, with the former opposed to and the latter in favor of ratification.
