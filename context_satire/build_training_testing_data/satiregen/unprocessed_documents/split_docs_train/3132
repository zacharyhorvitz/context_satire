Sabo's first work that received mainstream attention was in May 2014, where he put up posters attacking Democratic politician and then-candidate for governor of Texas Wendy Davis, who held a thirteen-hour-long filibuster to block Senate Bill 5 (a measure which included more restrictive abortion regulations for Texas) a year prior. The posters feature mostly-naked Barbie dolls with a plastic baby in her belly area and Davis' face plastered on, with the caption: "Hollywood welcomes Abortion Barbie Wendy Davis."  The Texas state senator whose filibuster of an abortion bill became a national phenomenon has a long history of persisting against tough odds. Wendy Davis -- the 50-year-old Democrat who stood and led a 13-hour filibuster Tuesday at the Texas Capitol -- went from being a teen mom to graduating from Harvard Law School. She began working after school at age 14 to help support her single mother and three siblings, according to her campaign website. "By 19, Wendy was a single mother herself, working two jobs to make ends meet in hopes of creating a better life for her young daughter."  A day after a filibuster and a raucous crowd in the state Capitol foiled passage of a bill that would have imposed strict new regulations on abortion in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry vowed Wednesday to try again. Perry said the Legislature would convene July 1 in special session to take up the abortion bill, which was declared dead before dawn Wednesday. The bill failed after a night of drama in Austin during which a lone lawmaker talked for more than 10 hours in an attempt to run out the clock on a special session.
