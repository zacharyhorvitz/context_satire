Shortly after the birth of Victoria, Prince Albert wrote a memoir detailing the tasks and duties of all those involved with the royal children. Another 48-page document, written a year and a half later by the Baron Stockmar, intimate of the royal couple, details the educational principles which were to be used with the little princes. The royal couple, however, had only a very vague idea of the proper educational development of a child. Queen Victoria, for example, believed that the fact that her baby sucked on bracelets was a sign of deficient education. But these letters also show the will of Queen Victoria to dictate her daughter's every move. She demanded that Victoria appear equally loyal to her homeland and her new country. But this quickly became impossible, and the most insignificant events confronted the princess with insoluble problems. For example, the death of the Duchess of Orl√©ans, a distant relative of the British and Prussian royal houses, brought a month of mourning in London, while in Berlin the mourning period lasted only one week.  Serena Williams progressed to the semifinals of the Rogers Cup on Friday by defeating Naomi Osaka 6-3 6-4, the first time the pair had met since the infamous US Open final in September of last year. Despite the loss, Osaka, who crashed out of Wimbledon in the first round last month, will return to the world No. 1 spot on Monday following Ashleigh Barty's opening round defeat in Toronto. Williams, meanwhile, who was recently ousted by Simona Halep in the Wimbledon final, looked in fine form against her Japanese opponent as she surpassed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario's record of 32 Rogers Cup wins.
