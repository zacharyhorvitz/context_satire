 The double-decker A380 was loved by passengers, aviation enthusiasts and executives at Airbus. But the world's largest commercial plane never won over the group that really mattered: airlines. Airbus pulled the plug on its superjumbo program on Thursday, announcing that it would deliver the final A380s to airlines such as Emirates by 2021. The decision by the European aviation group reflects a dramatic shift by airlines away from supersized aircraft in favor of smaller, more efficient planes that burn less fuel per passenger.  It's almost here. One of the aviation world's most hotly anticipated planes, the Airbus Beluga XL, has just completed a key round of testing at Hawarden Airport in Wales, ahead of entering service later this year. At a time when jumbo passenger airliners such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747 are on their way out, the Beluga XL -- the first of five -- will be one of the biggest beasts in the skies. You won't be able to travel in it, though. The airline has not been as keen to acquire or operate aging wide-body aircraft. In August 2014, Delta announced it would begin to retire its aging Boeing 747-400 fleet, which Delta acquired as part of the Northwest merger. During a 2014 earnings call, CEO Richard Anderson announced that they would be retired by the end of 2017. On November 20, 2014, the airline announced an order for 25 Airbus A350 XWB and 25 Airbus A330neo aircraft to replace the 747 fleet as it was retired, as well as some aging 767s.
