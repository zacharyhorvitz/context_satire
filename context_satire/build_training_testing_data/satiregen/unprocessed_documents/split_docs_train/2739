In Stanford University's 2015 Campus Climate Survey, 4.7 percent of female undergraduates reported experiencing sexual assault as defined by the university and 32.9 percent reported experiencing sexual misconduct. According to the survey, 85% of perpetrators of misconduct were Stanford students and 80% were men. Perpetrators of sexual misconduct were frequently aided by alcohol or drugs, according to the survey: "Nearly three-fourths of the students whose responses were categorized as sexual assault indicated that the act was accomplished by a person or person taking advantage of them when they were drunk or high, according to the survey. Close to 70 percent of students who reported an experience of sexual misconduct involving nonconsensual penetration and/or oral sex indicated the same."  Eight years ago, Jeff Ammon, now 55, began noticing a feeling of pressure in his ears every day after work. Over the next months, when his symptoms progressed into a slight loss of hearing and sensitivity to noise, he became worried. Ammon, a construction worker for 32 years, eventually started wearing ear protection hoping this would address these complaints â€” but it was too late. From that point on, sounds ranging from the hum of a lawnmower to normal tones of conversation caused a piercing, jabbing pain in his inner ear.  University of North Carolina linebacker Allen Artis turned himself in at a magistrate's court Wednesday morning, exactly seven months after a fellow student said he raped her on campus. The accuser, sophomore Delaney Robinson, told the media Tuesday she was angry over how authorities and the university have handled the case. "My life has changed forever, while the person who assaulted me remains as a student and a football player on this campus," said Robinson, now 19. Artis was charged Tuesday with sexual battery and assault on a female, both misdemeanors.
