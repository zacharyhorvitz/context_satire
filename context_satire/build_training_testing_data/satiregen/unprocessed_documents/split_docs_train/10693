In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole. In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an amicus brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor. In 2006, Liberty Mutual employees in the Los Angeles area claimed that the company failed to pay their overtime salaries. The situation escalated, and the employees filed a lawsuit against Liberty Mutual. In 2008, both parties amended their complaints and answers. The main Plaintiff Jennifer Yerger amended her complaint to include other employees, all of whom are also auditors for Liberty Mutual. Two Liberty Place was less warmly received by critics. Goldberger said that despite the similarity in appearance, Two Liberty was "as much of a slab as a tower, with a spire that looks as if it was plopped awkwardly on top instead of having grown naturally out of the building's overall form." He also criticized giving One Liberty Place a smaller, similar twin which he said gives the complex an odd look.
