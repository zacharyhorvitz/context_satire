In a 2012 interview with Pitchfork, frontman Alex Turner recalled that he and his friends were fans of Oasis, and that his mother "would always play the Eagles too, so I'm word-perfect on shitloads of Eagles tunes". He also listened to rappers such as Outkast, Eminem, Wu-Tang Clan and Roots Manuva, amongst others. He cited John Lennon, Ray Davies, Nick Cave and Method Man as major influences lyrically. When speaking about Lennon in an interview with NME, Turner said; "I remember when I first started writing songs, and writing lyrics, I really wanted to be able to write an "I Am the Walrus" type song, and I found it very difficult. In January 2012, Miles Kane confirmed that he would reunite with Arctic Monkeys' singer Alex Turner to record again as the Last Shadow Puppets, saying that he and Turner would record the follow-up to The Age Of The Understatement "when the time is right." Turner commented that he took a different approach to writing lyrics than on previous albums, noting that he "became less concerned on this album  compartmentalising every idea to the point where each song became this episode that starts and ends in three minutes". Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen inspired this different perspective on each lyric's relationship with its context. He further noted that his writing on the album was straightforward in a way he considered similar to the band's debut Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006). On the connections between the two albums, Turner commented that "it's set in a completely different place, obviously, but there's something in the lyrics that reminds me of something in that writing.
