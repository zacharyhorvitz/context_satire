Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, wrote a glowing review of the book, concluding: "This book has a controversial thesis. But it is basically right. The failure to recognise the role of the government in driving innovation may well be the greatest threat to rising prosperity." Similarly, Teresa Tritch concluded a favorable review of the book for the New York Times by noting: "The goal, as expressed by Professor Mazzucato, is not for taxpayer-provided research to spare the private sector from risks, but for government and the private sector to take risks together and enjoy the rewards as one."  Jobs, say hundreds of thousands of people. Pollution, say hundreds of thousands of others. They say that's what a proposed oil pipeline would bring into the country, as it transports crude from massive deposits in Canadian tar sands to refineries and ports in the United States. The Keystone XL pipeline has triggered a gush of comments from Americans for and against its construction.  A federal appeals court Tuesday backed the U.S. government's refusal to make public photos and video of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, taken after he was killed by U.S. Navy Seals two years ago in Pakistan. A three-judge panel turned down an appeal by Judicial Watch, which had filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the images. The government argued that releasing the images could result in attacks on Americans. "It is undisputed that the government is withholding the images not to shield wrongdoing or avoid embarrassment but rather to prevent the killing of Americans and violence against American interests," the judges said.
