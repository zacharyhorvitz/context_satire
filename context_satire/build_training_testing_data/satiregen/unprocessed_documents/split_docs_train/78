 After a wild and stormy night that claimed two lives, many communities in southern England face a high risk of flooding Saturday from still-rising rivers. Severe flood warnings are in place along the Thames Valley to the west of London, as well as in southwest and central England. The Environment Agency warned that flood risk will continue for at least another week. An elderly passenger died Friday aboard the British-based cruise ship MS Marco Polo after it was hit by a "freak wave during adverse sea conditions," according to the ship's owner, Cruise & Maritime Voyages.  The number of shark attacks last year dropped to a four-year low, but they were deadlier, a University of Florida report says. Worldwide, 10 people died in 72 shark attacks last year. That's higher than the average of 6.3 deaths over the past 10 years, said George Burgess, who conducts research on sharks at the University of Florida. The last time shark attacks were this low was 2009 when there were 67.  It seems that travelers can't catch a break this winter. This time it'll be the Northeast that takes another hit from the barrage of winter storms that has pounded U.S. airline itineraries this season. By 9 p.m. Wednesday, more than 4,000 Thursday flights had been canceled, according to FlightAware.com, as the storm system wreaking havoc in the Southeast advanced up the East Coast. On Wednesday, the world's busiest airport, in Atlanta, accounted for the largest share of the day's flight cancellations, with more than 1,600 of the 3,300-plus cancellations across the country.
