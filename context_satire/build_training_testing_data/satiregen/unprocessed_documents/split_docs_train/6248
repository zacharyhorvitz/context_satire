In 1996, Electrolux introduced the first “Robotic Vacuum Cleaner”. The early robotic vacuum cleaners worked well but had frequent problems with colliding with objects and stopping short of walls and other objects, as well as leaving small areas not cleaned. As a result, the original product failed in the market and was discontinued. The first robot cleaner to be put into production was Electrolux Trilobite by the Swedish household and professional appliances manufacturer, Electrolux. In 1990, three robotists, Colin Angle, Helen Greiner, and Rodney Brooks, founded iRobot. The American advanced technology company was originally dedicated to making robots for military and domestic use. For its civilian consumers, iRobot sought to robotize household chores. It launched the Roomba in 2002. iRobot Create is a hobbyist robot manufactured by iRobot that was introduced in 2007 and based on their Roomba vacuum cleaning platform. The iRobot Create is explicitly designed for robotics development and improves the experience beyond simply hacking the Roomba. The Create replaces its Roomba predecessor's vacuum cleaner hardware with a cargo bay that also houses a DB-25 port providing serial communication, digital input & output, analog input & output, and an electric power supply. The Create also has a 7-pin Mini-DIN serial port through which sensor data can be read and motor commands can be issued using the iRobot Roomba Open Interface (ROI) protocol.
