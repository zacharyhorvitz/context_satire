The Plumber does not appear in Ratchet: Deadlocked; although the credits state that he had been called away to deal with a "sump pump emergency in the Rygylian Nebula". He appears with a non-speaking role as a memory in part of a dream-state world level in Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters, and also appears in Secret Agent Clank to fix the showers at the prison in which Ratchet is incarcerated, returning them to their typical freezing cold temperature. In 2013, most of Tigers Jaw's original members left the group, leaving vocalist/keyboardist Brianna Collins and vocalist/guitarist Ben Walsh as the remaining members. However, the original members returned to record Charmer in 2014, which was recorded with producer Will Yip. Spin was recorded with Yip at Studio 4 in Pennsylvania. Walsh said that he and Collins had discussed how to make the album and "what felt the most like Tigers Jaw ... the initial version of the band was just two people writing and recording everything". It was at roughly the same time that one of Ripchord's demos was put on a CD featuring unsigned bands that was given to James Endeacott, the man responsible for signing The Libertines. Endeacott liked Ripchord's song and went to see them in Wolverhampton only to gain more interest with them. At the time they met he was just leaving Rough Trade but was about to set up his own record label 1965 Records. He asked Ripchord to sign to his new label to which they all agreed after no moment's hesitation.
