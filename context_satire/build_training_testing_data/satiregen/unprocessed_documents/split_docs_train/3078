Mary Magdalene (alone in the Gospel of John, but accompanied by other women in the Synoptics) goes to Jesus' tomb on Sunday morning and is surprised to find it empty. Despite Jesus' teaching, the disciples had not understood that Jesus would rise again. It was founded in 1882 and closed in 2005 after 123 years. A new Catholic School Detroit Cristo Rey High School opened in the Holy Redeemer High School building in 2008 to the delight of many who remained disappointed at the closing of Holy Redeemer High School. Christo Rey, at its founding in Detroit, occupied one portion of the Holy Redeemer High School building while a public charter school occupied the other portion of the building. The adjoining Holy Redeemer Catholic Parish and Holy Redeemer grade school both remain in operation. The early Christians placed Kyrios at the center of their understanding, and from that center attempted to understand the other issues related to the Christian mysteries. The question of the deity of Christ in the New Testament is inherently related to the Kyrios title of Jesus used in the early Christian writings and its implications for the absolute lordship of Jesus. In early Christian belief, the concept of Kyrios included the pre-existence of Christ, for they believed if Christ is one with God, he must have been united with God from the very beginning.
