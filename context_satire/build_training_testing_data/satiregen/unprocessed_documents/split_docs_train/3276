 Hillary Clinton will be center stage on Tuesday night for the Democratic presidential candidates' first debate, according to the podium order released by CNN, which is hosting the event. The position of the five candidates on the stage at the CNN Facebook Democratic Debate in Las Vegas is based on polls since Aug. 1 and was announced on CNN's "State of the Union." On either side of Clinton, the highest-polling candidate, are Bernie Sanders (to Clinton's right) and Martin O'Malley (to her left). Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, the fourth- and fifth-placing candidates, bookend the stage.  Sam Snead, a golf legend for some four decades, used to caution players: "Forget your opponents; always play against par." Hillary Clinton might heed that advice Tuesday night as she enters the first Democratic debate, hosted by CNN. The temptations will be toward racking up more debating points than any of the other four candidates on stage, especially Bernie Sanders. Her handlers are sure to have worked up some clever retorts when anyone hits her, as they will.  The first Republican presidential debate of the year was typified by interview-style questions individually targeting each candidate. The second GOP debate emphasized split-screen face-offs between candidates. Now it's time for the first Democratic debate of the election cycle, airing on CNN Tuesday night. So what approach will the moderator Anderson Cooper take?
