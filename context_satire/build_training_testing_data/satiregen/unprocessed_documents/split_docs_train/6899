 Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn said he plans to vote for Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump, even if he isn't selected as vice president. "I would not think a second to vote for anybody else," he told CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day." "I think at this stage this is a guy who provides a different vision, a different way to solve problems, a different leadership style, and a sense of change that I believe a majority of people in this country are really starting to look at." He said that over a year ago, he was contacted by several candidates in the presidential race and that he would provide guidance to any candidates who asked.  Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson said Thursday that Ted Cruz's call to "vote your conscience" essentially encouraged people to support the former New Mexico governor. "He did say to vote for Gary Johnson, didn't he? And that was 'vote your conscience,'" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day." "I certainly would uphold the Constitution."  Radio host Laura Ingraham brought the house down Wednesday night with an attack on the Donald Trump hold-outs during her speech at the Republican National Convention. "We should all -- even you boys with wounded feelings and bruised egos -- we love you, but you must honor your pledge to support Donald Trump now," she said. As the crowd roared on its feet, she added: "Tonight." The message seemed to be for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who was scheduled to speak later in the evening, and has yet to endorse Trump.
