The primary rival of the Crips is the Bloods street-gang. The rivalry dates back to the 1960s when Raymond Washington and several other Crips confronted Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens, students at Centennial High School. In response to the attack, Scott, who lived in Compton, established the Piru street-gang, the first "Bloods" street gang. Owens established the West Piru street-gang. The Crips are a gang based in the coastal regions of southern California. They were founded in Los Angeles, California in 1969 mainly by Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams. Once a single alliance between two autonomous gangs, they are now a loosely connected network of individual "sets", often engaged in open warfare with one another. Its members traditionally wear blue clothing, a practice that has waned somewhat due to police crackdowns specifically targeting gang members. While every Crips street gang has members that are more likely to be involved in street crime, a disproportionate amount of the Harlem Crips members are known for being more businesslike and ambitious making the gang an overwhelmingly organized crime group. One of their members Lord Ami (P-dOG) was on the staff at Death Row Records and encouraged youths he was acquainted with towards getting their education so they could come work with him and earn money legally. Colombian cartels use Belize as one of their major routes to move cocaine and heroin to the USA. Colombian narcotraffickers do business with gang bosses in Belize who in turn use their connections with expatriate Belizean gang members in cities like New York and Los Angeles.
