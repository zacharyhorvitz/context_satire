 Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore denied that he has ever molested anyone and repeated that he has never met the women who have accused of him sexual assault in an interview with "The Voice of Alabama Politics" on Sunday. "I did not know them," Moore said of the women who have accused him. "I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone, and for them to say that, I don't know why they're saying it, but it's not true."  Former GOP House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said Tuesday that Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore doesn't deserve to win the special election in Alabama. "I think he deserves to lose," Cantor told CNN's "New Day." "And when I was in office as majority leader, I had the policy of zero tolerance for any of this kind of stuff." Moore has been accused of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s.  Sen. Richard Shelby says he wants a Republican elected to the Senate on Tuesday to represent Alabama, but that he didn't vote for GOP candidate Roy Moore in the special election. The Alabama Republican said he's already cast his ballot, and that he chose a write-in candidate. "I'd rather see the Republican win, but I'd rather see a Republican write-in. I couldn't vote for Roy Moore.
