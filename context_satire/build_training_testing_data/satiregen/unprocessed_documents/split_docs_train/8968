The film was heavily criticised due to the excessive use of footage from the original film. However, the film does have an audience with slasher fans/horror fans, and has gained a cult following as a black comedy, due to Freeman's performance. In addition, the scene in which Ricky shoots a man who is taking out his trash became an Internet meme. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 14% rating, out of 7 reviews, and an average score of 3.1/10. Cutting back to the present day, Ricky kills Dr. Bloom and escapes from the mental hospital, murdering a Salvation Army Santa and stealing the costume. Ricky plans a mission to accomplish what Billy failed to do, which was to kill Mother Superior. After chasing Mother Superior throughout her house, Ricky succeeds in decapitating her. Ricky cleans up the blood and stages the scene to make it look like Mother Superior sitting in a chair by placing the loose unconnected head on her body. On the filmâ€™s DVD commentary, the filmmakers say that they were paid a dismal amount of money to make the film. Originally, they say, they were told to re-edit the first film and pass it off as a sequel. Director Lee Harry said that he demanded that a new film be shot, though he did not have the budget to create an entirely new story.
