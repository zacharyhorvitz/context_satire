The Tower of London, officially Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, is a  historic  castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, the wife of Prince William, gave birth to the couple's third child on Monday, a son who becomes the fifth in line to the British throne. The Duke of Cambridge was present for the birth, at 11 a.m. local time at St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, Kensington Palace said. The newest arrival to the royal family weighs 8lbs 7oz (3.8 kilograms), and both mother and baby are "doing well," according to the Palace. "The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and members of both families have been informed and are delighted with the news," Kensington Palace said in a statement on Twitter.  Move over, #RoyalBaby. Princess Charlotte, not even 3, has just made history. Although her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, gave birth to a son Monday morning, Charlotte's order in the line of succession to the British throne won't change based on her gender. This makes Charlotte the first princess who won't be overtaken in the line by a younger brother.
