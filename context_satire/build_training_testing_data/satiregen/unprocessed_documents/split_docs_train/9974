"Big Nate started as more of a "domestic humour" strip than it is now. I intended to feature a lot of stories about Nate's single dad, and all the comic possibilities inherent in that. But before too long, I realized that the part of the strip that I enjoyed most was the school humour. I'd been a teacher myself, and schools can be very funny places." Gilly Hopkins is the meanest girl in town: she has a birth mother she has never seen and has moved from one foster home to another. Learning that she will be sent to a new home, she wastes no time stirring up trouble. Then she meets a woman named Trotter, who wants to be the mother Gilly needs. With Gilly posing a challenge, Trotter must prove a good relationship will benefit both of them. Hopkins' marriage to Gallagher ended in the mid-1980s and she raised their children, Tela, Gilbert, and Peter, as a single parent. She was a grandmother of five.
