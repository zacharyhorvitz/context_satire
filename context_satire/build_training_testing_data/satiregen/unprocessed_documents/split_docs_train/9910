The company was founded as "Shinawatra Computer Service and Investment" by Thaksin Shinawatra, who later became the Prime Minister of Thailand. The sale of Shinawatra family's stake in Shin Corporation to Singapore's Temasek Holdings in 2006 sparked controversy, which intensified the anti-Thaksin movement. In 2005 and 2006, a series of events occurred in Thailand as a result of an unrest with Thaksin Shinawatra that was supported by Sondhi Limthongkul and his coalitions. It led a military coup that concluded in the overthrow of the Thai Rak Thai government in September 2006, the flight of Thaksin after the court verdict, and the establishment of the junta government led by Surayud Chulanont, a favourite of privy councillor and senior statesman Prem Tinsulanonda. On 16 July 2003, the Thai Post published comments from media rights advocate Supinya Klangnarong, who said that the Shin Corporation, at the time majority owned by the family of Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, had benefited because of favourable policies by the Thaksin government.
