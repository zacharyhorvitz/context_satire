Critical response to Take One has been mixed. Allmusic said that "The songs aren’t horrible but they’re not memorable and neither are Lambert’s performances, but that’s unfair to him: these recordings were designed to sell middle-of-the-road pop with commercial aspirations and have absolutely no room for flair, since the whole point is to showcase the lyric and melody. Lambert acquits himself in that regard, sounding like nothing more than a demo singer because that was, after all, what he was".  Each one bears his own scar. This close-knit band of paramedics and ambulance drivers risk their lives saving others on the front lines of Gaza's wars. Paramedic Alaa Abu Sheir has a shrapnel wound to the arm. But that's not the one that cuts the deepest. Although Lambert was not Newman's first choice to produce the series—Don Taylor and Shaun Sutton had both declined the position—he was very keen to ensure that Lambert took the job after his experience of working with her at ABC. "I think the best thing I ever did on that was to find Verity Lambert," he told Doctor Who Magazine in 1993. "I remembered Verity as being bright and, to use the phrase, full of piss and vinegar! She was gutsy and she used to fight and argue with me, even though she was not at a very high level as a production assistant."
