 Facebook just announced something that might be a radical change to its advertising business. Key word: Might. Right now it's hard to tell how significant it'll really be. "We're going to make political advertising more transparent," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Thursday.  Facebook will share the content and related information of the more than 3,000 ads it sold to Russian-linked accounts with the House and Senate intelligence committees, the company said Thursday. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg held a Facebook Live event Thursday afternoon to explain the company's 9-point plan to deal with election interference. "We are in a new world. It is a new challenge for internet communities to have to deal with nation states attempting to subvert elections, but if that's what we must do then we are committed to rising to the occasion," Zuckerberg said.  Amid growing concern over Facebook's sale of political ads to Russians, Democratic Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner have formally called for new legislation to enhance the transparency of online political advertisements, CNN has learned. Klobuchar and Warner sent a letter to their colleagues on Thursday inviting them to co-sponsor legislation that would among other things require all major digital platforms to keep a public record of groups or individuals that make ad buys of more than $10,000. The letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, was sent out shortly after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that his company would share the ads it inadvertently sold to Russian-linked accounts during the 2016 election with the House and Senate intelligence committees, and would make a number of changes to its platform related to political ads, including adding disclosures to such advertising.
