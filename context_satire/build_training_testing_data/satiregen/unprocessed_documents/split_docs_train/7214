Presidential approval polls have shown him to be consistently unpopular. His approval rating has been steady at around 40% with an unusually narrow margin between lowest and highest of Â±5%. Polls taken during the first ten months of Trump's term showed him to be the least popular U.S. president in the history of modern opinion polls, and this has remained consistent, with the average of polls showing more than 50% disapproval since March 2017 with virtually no approval outside of Republican voters. A Pew Research Center global poll conducted in July 2017, found "a median of just 22 percent has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs". It was announced by Donald Trump in August 2017 that his daughter would lead the U.S. delegation to India in the fall in a global support of women's entrepreneurship. In response to the announcement, an Indian diplomat was quoted as stating, "We regard Ivanka Trump the way we do half-wit Saudi princes. It's in our national interest to flatter them." The majority of reactions to her actual performance alongside P.M. Modi at the event were substantial.  On Sunday night, as the political world was wondering whether he might offer a more fulsome celebration of the life of John McCain, President Donald Trump instead tweeted this: "Over 90% approval rating for your all time favorite (I hope) President within the Republican Party and 52% overall. This despite all of the made up stories by the Fake News Media trying endlessly to make me look as bad and evil as possible. Look at the real villains please!" Which, given what we know about Trump (he is uniquely self-focused) and how much he cares about positive polling (a whole hell of a lot), isn't terribly surprising.
