Once Donald Trump was sworn in as president, Berkowitz went to work at the White House as the “right-hand man” to Kushner. Berkowitz's official title at the White House was “special assistant to the president and assistant to the senior adviser.” Jared Corey Kushner (born January 10, 1981) is an American investor, real-estate developer, and newspaper publisher who is currently senior advisor to his father-in-law, Donald Trump, the president of the United States. Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer Charles Kushner, the son of Jewish immigrants from the USSR, and is married to Ivanka Trump, President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company Kushner Companies, which launched his business career. He later also bought Observer Media, publisher of the New York Observer. As the brother of Donald Trump's senior advisor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, Joshua stated through his spokesman that "he loved his brother and did not want to say anything that might embarrass him." Nevertheless, the spokesman also said that "Josh is a life-long Democrat and did not vote for Donald Trump in November", with their parents being Democratic donors until 2016.
