In September of 2016, Rita Marley suffered a "serious" stroke while on a visit to Miami to attend a special event and has kept a low public profile since. However, she made her first public appearance at an award ceremony on March 9, 2019 in Kingston to accept the Iconic Award (For a Duo/Group), along with her fellow I Three members Griffiths and Mowatt, given by the Jamaica Reggae Industry Association. After those recordings for the Studio One label coached by Bob, Rita married Bob Marley around February 1966, just before her husband moved to Wilmington, Delaware (USA) for a few months to make a living working at the Dupont Hotel there. Bob was replaced by Constantine "Vision" Walker, who recorded a few songs as a member of The Wailers during this period. On 19 June 2007, during the annual meeting of the Annapolis Group, members discussed a letter to college presidents asking them not to participate in the "reputation survey" section of the U.S. News survey (this section comprises 25% of the ranking). As a result, "a majority of the approximately 80 presidents at the meeting said that they did not intend to participate in the U.S. News reputational rankings in the future." However, the decision to fill out the reputational survey was left to each individual college. The statement stated that its members "have agreed to participate in the development of an alternative common format that presents information about their colleges for students and their families to use in the college search process."
