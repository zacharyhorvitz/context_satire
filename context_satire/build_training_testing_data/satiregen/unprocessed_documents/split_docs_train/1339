 At least 40 migrants died attempting to cross the Mediterranean and another 312 had to be rescued, the Italian navy said after encountering their boat Saturday. Additional details about how the 40 died were not immediately available. The navy said that it had transferred the survivors to the Norwegian supply ship Siem Pilot, which is patrolling the central Mediterranean as part of the ongoing European Union effort to assist seafaring migrants. Last month the Siem Pilot ferried 785 migrants safely to port after the Italian coast guard rescued them from a wooden boat and a rubber dinghy off the Libyan coast.

Jorge Lorenzo won the Czech MotoGP Sunday with the kind of precision performance that has become his hallmark. The Spaniard led from start to finish, vanquishing reigning champion Marc Marquez to a distant second and -- crucially -- his Movistar Yamaha team mate, Valentino Rossi, to third. In front of almost 139,000 spectators, it was the type of imperious performance befitting a champion in waiting. For the first time this season there was also the distinct impression that Lorenzo is ready to try the crown on for size.
