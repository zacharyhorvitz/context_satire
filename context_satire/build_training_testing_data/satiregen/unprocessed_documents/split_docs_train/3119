 Drug store giant Walgreens Boots Alliance is one of the worst stocks in the Dow this year. But shares shot up Tuesday after Reuters reported that the company is considering taking itself private. Shares of Walgreens popped 3.5% in heavy trading on the report. Rivals CVS and Rite Aid briefly moved off their lows of the day but were still trading in negative territory.  Sherry Ellis found out she was dead the day after Halloween. The 73-year-old from Magnolia, Texas, was picking up her prescription from Walgreens when her bank card was declined. She said she knew something was fishy because the card was three months old. So she went to the bank, and after rounds of phone calls Ellis found out she had been declared dead by the Social Security Administration.  Walgreens Boots Alliance became the most recent addition to the Dow Jones Industrial Average in June 2018, when it replaced struggling conglomerate General Electric in America's most famous stock market indicator. Its Dow tenure may be among the shortest. KKR has approached Walgreens about taking it over, Bloomberg reported Monday. If Walgreens winds up getting bought out, the deal could be the biggest leveraged buyout ever.
