Matt Damon is an American actor, producer and screenwriter. He made his screen debut with a minor role in the 1988 film Mystic Pizza. After appearing in a series of supporting parts in much of the 1990s, Damon was cast by Francis Ford Coppola as the lead of the 1997 legal drama The Rainmaker. His breakthrough came later that year when he played the title role of an unrecognized genius in Good Will Hunting, a drama which he also co-wrote with Ben Affleck. In November 2016, producer Frank Marshall acknowledged that Universal Pictures is optimistic regarding a Jason Bourne sequel. In the same interview, he reported that a follow-up installment to The Bourne Legacy, is unlikely although the studio has not ruled it out. In March 2017, franchise star Matt Damon, cast doubt upon a sequel stating that the audience "might be done" with the character. Damon was part of the all-star cast assembled by Kimmel for his 2012 Oscars parody, which was a mock trailer for a non-existent blockbuster called Movie: The Movie. Damon appears briefly in a full grape suit, only to be informed his scene had been cut from the "film" after which he is shown storming out of the studio (as part of the trailer), cursing at Kimmel.
