 President Barack Obama went to Chicago bearing gifts Thursday for his former chief of staff, Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Five days before Chicago voters head to the polls on Tuesday to determine whether Emanuel will win the 50% support he needs to avoid a runoff and win a second term, Obama visited the city's historic Pullman district to designate it as one of the nation's newest national monuments. But the day had all the trappings of a campaign -- and Obama even made an unannounced stop at a Kenwood campaign office for Emanuel on his way out of town. "I'm glad he's my mayor, and I'm glad he's going to be my mayor for another four years," Obama told volunteers. "When he returned to Alego he was very thin and dirty. He had difficulty walking, and his head was full of lice." For some time, he was too traumatized to speak about his experiences. His wife told his grandson Obama: "From that day on, I saw that he was now an old man." The prosecution case was that Bamber, motivated by hatred and greed, had left White House Farm around 10 pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, to drive to his home in Head Street, Goldhanger. Later, perhaps in the early hours of the morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother's bicycle—which he had borrowed a few days earlier—cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the house from the back. He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs.
