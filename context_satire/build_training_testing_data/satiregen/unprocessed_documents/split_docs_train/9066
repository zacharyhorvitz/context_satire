 Egypt's intelligence chief is spearheading talks with Hamas and Israel to forge a stop to the five days of warring that has engulfed Gaza and the Jewish state and head off an Israeli ground offensive into the besieged Palestinian territory. Mohammed Shehata contacted Israel and requested that it "calm down" the situation, a general with Egyptian intelligence told CNN. He is trying to persuade both sides to reach a cease-fire, and negotiations are still ongoing with no clear conclusion yet, said the general, who asked not to be named. The Palestinian Information Center, a Hamas-run media outlet, said Shehata met with Hamas leader Khalid Meshaal on Saturday in an attempt "to calm the situation and stop the Zionist assault on Gaza."  Israeli airstrikes on targets in Gaza continued into the early morning hours of Tuesday, the military said. The air force bombed a weapons storage facility and two sites where rockets had been launched, according to a statement from the Israel Defense Forces. A military representative said militants have launched more than 115 rockets toward Israel since Saturday. "The IDF will not tolerate any attempt to harm Israeli civilians and will operate against anyone who uses terror against the state of Israel," an Israel Defense Forces statement said.  The political leader of Hamas says the group is not behind Wednesday's deadly bus bomb in Tel Aviv, but he did say he believed the bombing was a response to the ongoing violence in Gaza. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in Cairo, Egypt, Khaled Meshaal spoke about the prospects for a cease-fire in Gaza and detailed Hamas' mindset as it continues to exchange rocket fire with Israel. Hamas is considered a terrorist group by both Israel and the United States. Amanpour: There has been a terrible attack inside Israel today, in Tel Aviv.
