Tom Amberry (November 13, 1922 â€“ March 18, 2017) was an American podiatrist who is best known for holding the Guinness world record for most consecutive free throws made, having shot 2,750 of them in a row in a span of 12 hours over the course of one day in 1993 at the age of 71. He had worked with the Chicago Bulls to help the players with their free throw shooting. He decided to forego a two-year contract to play with the then-Minneapolis Lakers, choosing to attend podiatry school instead. His medical office was located on Atlantic Avenue in Long Beach, California. Eighty-eight percent of residents eat some fruits and vegetables every day, which is about the same as the city's average of 87%.

One of the very first was ABC No Rio. Begun by a group of Colab no wave artists (some living on Ludlow Street), ABC No Rio opened an outsider gallery space that invited community participation and encouraged the widespread production of art. Taking an activist approach to art that grew out of The Real Estate Show (the take over of an abandoned building by artists to open an outsider gallery only to have it chained closed by the police) ABC No Rio kept its sense of activism, community, and outsiderness.
