Presidents use Oval Office addresses as a way to directly communicate with the American people. It is considered to be a major address and it functions as a way to move public opinion by having a direct connection with the President of the United States. Presidential historian, Robert Dallek stated, “The Oval Office invokes the center of the presidential authority. That's the president's office, that's where he supposedly makes decisions, where he governs.” The tone of the speech is set when Presidents decide to make a speech in the Oval Office. There have been suggestions that the traditional Oval Office address is falling out of favor in the Information Age, with White House aide Daniel Pfeiffer describing it as "an argument from the 80s" when President Ronald Reagan would draw tens of millions of viewers per address (40 in all, the second-most of any president; Nixon ranks first, having given 43). Television networks are increasingly reluctant to sacrifice airtime for a political purpose. President Obama preferred to use the East Room, as in his announcement of the death of Osama bin Laden; Trump prefers to use the Diplomatic reception room. The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. Three days after the attacks, Bush visited Ground Zero and met with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers.
