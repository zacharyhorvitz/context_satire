 A handful of Republicans are beginning to voice calls for a special prosecutor — or at least an independent commission — to investigate Russia's election-year meddling and ties to the Trump. But most rank-and-file Republicans are resisting that step amid the uproar over former FBI Director James Comey's memo saying President Donald Trump asked him to end the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Senate Republicans argue House and Senate intelligence committees' investigations are continuing to proceed with bipartisan support, and that that they should be the primary vehicles for the investigation. "I don't think we're there yet," Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake said of a special prosecutor.  On Tuesday night, CNN's Dana Bash tweeted: "Source w knowledge of wh discussions tells me senior officials did not think firing james comey would be a big political explosion." If Republicans needed a rationale to run, not walk, away from Donald Trump -- this insight into the West Wing's mindset is it. If the President and his team are this incapable at measuring public opinion and congressional reaction, why on earth would you stand by and carry their water? At best, Trump and his team are incompetent -- and there's a lot to be said about the possible "at worst" scenarios.  Sen. John McCain invoked Watergate in describing the escalating controversy surrounding alleged ties between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia. "I think it's reaching the point where it's of Watergate size and scale, and a couple of other scandals you and I have seen," the Arizona Republican said Tuesday night. "It's the centipede that the shoe continues to drop. Every couple of days, there's a new aspect of this really unhappy situation."
