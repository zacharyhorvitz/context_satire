 Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said she was disinvited from Tuesday night's first Democratic debate after voicing a call for more of them. Gabbard, the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Monday on "The Situation Room" she was told her vocal support for more debates had made her "no longer welcome to come to the debate." Gabbard said the message was conveyed to her chief-of-staff from the chief-of-staff of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. "The prevailing message of that was that because I continued to call for more debates, that I should not go to the debate in Las Vegas," the Hawaii congresswoman said.  Hillary Clinton stopped at a union rally outside Donald Trump's hotel on the Strip here, taunting the Republican front-runner on the eve of the first Democratic presidential debate. "Some people think Trump is entertaining, but it is not entertaining to insult immigrants and women," Clinton said. Clinton joined about 500 members of the Culinary Workers Union -- a powerhouse in Nevada, with 55,000 members. The group is lobbying to organize the Trump International Hotel here.  The first Republican presidential debate of the year was typified by interview-style questions individually targeting each candidate. The second GOP debate emphasized split-screen face-offs between candidates. Now it's time for the first Democratic debate of the election cycle, airing on CNN Tuesday night. So what approach will the moderator Anderson Cooper take?
