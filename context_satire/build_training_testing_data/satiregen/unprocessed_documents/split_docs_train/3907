 The World Health Organization declared a "public health emergency of international concern" Monday over the Zika virus and the health problems that doctors fear it is causing. The agency said the emergency is warranted because of how fast the mosquito-borne virus is spreading and its suspected link to an alarming spike in babies born with abnormally small heads -- a condition called microcephaly -- in Brazil and French Polynesia. Reports of a serious neurological condition, called Guillame-Barre Syndrome,  that can lead to paralysis, have also risen in areas where the virus has been reported. Health officials have specifically seen clusters of this in El Salvador, Brazil and French Polynesia, according to WHO's Dr. Bruce Aylward.  Two major U.S. airlines say they are allowing staff members to opt out of flights to Latin America and the Caribbean amid escalating concerns over the spread of the Zika virus and its effects on unborn children. United said Wednesday that it was giving pregnant flight attendants the option of withdrawing from assignments to countries affected by the mosquito-borne virus, which has been linked to babies being born with abnormally small heads. "The safety of our employees is paramount and providing this option was the right thing to do under these circumstances," said United spokesman Rahsaan Johnson. Delta said it has been offering for more than two weeks to let flight attendants and pilots swap out of scheduled flights to areas flagged by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Vaccines and antibiotics have made many infectious diseases a thing of the past; we've come to expect that public health and modern science can conquer all microbes. But nature is a formidable adversary. And Zika is our newest threat, particularly to pregnant women. New, unfamiliar and mysterious threats to our health are scary.
