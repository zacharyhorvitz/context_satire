Kristy Lee Roshia, 35, called the Boston office of the Secret Service on November 10, 2009, and told them she planned to "blow away" First Lady Michelle Obama while the family visited Honolulu, Hawaii, for a Christmas vacation. She also indicated she planned to shoot members of the United States Marine Corps. Roshia told authorities she knew "the exact location" the Obama family would be staying. Information that Roshia provided to the Boston office was consistent with the itinerary of the Obama family at the Secret Service office in Hawaii, and authorities believe Roshia had observed Secret Service agents in the area of the Kailua Beach home where the Obamas had previously stayed. U.S. President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) makes a controversial proposal to remove military forces from the Middle East. Divorced Capitol Police officer John Cale (Channing Tatum) is assigned to Speaker of the House Eli Raphelson (Richard Jenkins), whose nephew he saved while serving in Afghanistan.

His interviewer, Deputy Special Agent-in-Charge Carol Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a college acquaintance, deems him unqualified for the job. Jerry Blanchard, an accountant from Charlotte, North Carolina, was indicted for threatening to kill Obama during a July 15, 2008, breakfast at a Charlotte Waffle House. Two customers said Blanchard told them, "Obama and his wife are never going to make it to the White House. He needs to be taken out and I can do it in a heartbeat." The customers contacted the Secret Service, who questioned Blanchard.
