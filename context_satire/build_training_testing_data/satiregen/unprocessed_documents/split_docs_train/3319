 President Trump pressured Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his decision to recuse himself from oversight of the Russia investigation and special counsel Robert Mueller is now probing that exchange, according to a report from the New York Times. The newspaper reported Tuesday that when Sessions flew down to Florida to have dinner with the President at his Mar-a-Lago resort in March 2017, Trump berated Sessions about his decision and asked him to rescind it, a request Sessions declined. This exchange, as well as the repeated attacks on Sessions by Trump in the media and on Twitter, are part of Mueller's investigation, the paper reported. Mueller has been reported to be focused on obstruction of justice in his inquiry.  President Donald Trump pressured Attorney General Jeff Sessions on multiple occasions over the last 14 months to overturn his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, according to a source familiar with the President's demands. Trump made the request on several occasions -- each to no avail. The President's repeated attempts to pressure Sessions followed an initial request from Trump in March 2017 asking the attorney general to reverse his recusal while at Mar-a-Lago, which was first reported by The New York Times. The Times reported that special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating that request. In addition to criticizing him, Trump often used Twitter to suggest things he thought Sessions should do or to criticize Justice Department actions. According to Senator Jeff Flake, "the president has been pushing  very openly to go after the president's enemies and lay off his friends," adding "And so far, Jeff Sessions, bless his heart, has resisted and maintained that the judiciary needs to be independent." Trump demanded that Sessions investigate Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and various employees of the FBI and Justice Department. In August 2018 he said that Sessions should "stop" the Mueller investigation.
