 Former second lady Jill Biden made the case for her husband to be the Democratic presidential nominee Monday with a blunt assessment for how to beat President Donald Trump: "Electability." "I know that not all of you are committed to my husband, and I respect that," Biden said at a campaign event in Nashua, New Hampshire, to a group of teachers. "But I want you to think about your candidate, his or her electability, and who's going to win this race." Biden's message on electability Monday underlines a key strength for former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign. While attending the launch of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement on March 30, 2017, a student asked Biden what "piece of advice" he would give to President Trump. Biden responded that the President should grow up and cease his tweeting so he could focus on the office. During a speech at a May 29, 2017 gathering of Phil Murphy supporters at a community center gymnasium, Biden said, "There are a lot of people out there who are frightened. Trump played on their fears.  Listen to the majority of candidates running for the Democratic presidential nomination or scroll through Twitter and you will rapidly conclude that the Democratic Party is dominated by liberals. You would be wrong. According to the new CNN-SSRS national poll, self-identifying liberals make up less than half of all Democrats: 42%. The rest of the party calls itself either "moderate" (43%) or conservative (11%).
