Will Tracy, an associate editor at The Onion, told the New York Times in 2010 that the Office of the Vice President had sent the Onion staff an email with the message "Keep it up. He really likes it." Tracy commented, "Apparently he's a fan." Biden's office denied being aware of any communication between the Vice President and The Onion. On April 30, 2016, The Onion hosted a Biden-themed event to coincide with the White House Correspondents' Dinner. Titled "Diamond Joe Biden's Badass Balls-to-the-Wall Fiesta", the event was hosted at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. The event featured an ice sculpture of Biden riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and a string quartet playing renditions of hair-metal songs. Biden was invited to attend, but declined. Created by Onion writer Chad Nackers, the character was developed over the course of the real Biden's two terms as Vice President of the United States between 2009 and 2017. Although the newspaper had first mentioned Biden in 2006, he had never been the focus of an Onion piece until the character's debut, which coincided with Obama and Biden's inauguration in January 2009. Nackers and others have recognized the character's true debut as the May 2009 article "Shirtless Biden Washes Trans Am in White House Driveway", which was the first full-length treatment of the character. Since then, the Biden character has appeared in more than 50 Onion articles and numerous videos.
