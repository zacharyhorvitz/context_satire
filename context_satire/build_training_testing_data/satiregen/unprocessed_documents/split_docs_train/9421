 Word that Hillary Clinton was coming to the Iowa Capitol traveled fast. By the time the Democratic presidential hopeful arrived at the golden-domed building in Des Moines, she was met by more than 100 people, a mix of school students on tours, legislative pages relived of their duty and reporters eager to ask her questions. Clinton -- who told reporters she was "having a great time" and was "excited to be back" -- waved to the line of school students as she moved into the capital rotunda. When she approached the room of waiting Iowa Democratic lawmakers, Clinton began to shake hands and take selfies.  Iowa or bust. Hillary Clinton is kicking off her second bid for the White House with a road trip, riding from New York to her first campaign stop on Tuesday in Iowa. She was spotted on Sunday evening chatting with people at a gas station in Pennsylvania. Chris Learn, a 19-year-old student at Penn State Altoona, told CNN that he ran into Clinton at a Pilot gas station.
