 President Donald Trump will make his final pitch on tax reform to the American people Wednesday in a speech that will not "lean in on as many of the specifics as his prior tax reform speeches," according to two senior administration officials who briefed reporters Tuesday. The administration sees this as a higher-altitude speech, saying the President has already addressed specific rate brackets in previous speeches. Joined by about 120 people -- families and military personnel who have been invited -- the President will speak Wednesday afternoon from the Grand Foyer of the White House. Some young people will be among those invited, and the President will dedicate a "very significant portion" of his speech to the next generation that will be affected by tax reform.  President Trump thinks more poor people should work. Congressional Republicans do, too. So expect to hear the phrase "work requirements" a lot next year. It will likely be a central feature of the GOP's planned overhaul of the nation's safety net.  The stock market's record-breaking ascent this year has become a favorite topic for President Donald Trump. "With the great vote on Cutting Taxes, this could be a big day for the Stock Market - and YOU!" he tweeted on Monday morning. It's true -- the S&P 500 is up 17.4% since the beginning of the year and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 22.2%, reflecting strong corporate earnings and the anticipation of a massive tax cut.
