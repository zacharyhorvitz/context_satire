 Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Wednesday hailed the nuclear deal with Iran as "historic" and said critics should take the time to study the deal before slamming the accord. "I think it's very very important to study it and for people to just flat out say it doesn't work or they're going to derail it in our congress, I hope people don't mean it," Albright, who served as secretary of state in President Bill Clinton's administration, said on CNN's "New Day." The deal, she said, is "one of the more complicated foreign policy issues that I've ever seen." As Republicans attack, Obama defends Iran deal Albright dismissed criticisms of the deal and said she believes the verification provisions of the deal and the mechanisms to snapback economic sanctions and Iran are tough enough to keep Iran from a nuclear weapon.  President Barack Obama defended the recently announced landmark nuclear deal with Iran in an interview with The New York Times on Tuesday, his first interview following the deal. The President said the agreement "was the most definitive path by which Iran will not get a nuclear weapon." He reiterated that the United States was keeping its guard up and was not losing sight of Iran's past behavior. "This whole system that we built is not based on trust, it's based on a verifiable mechanism whereby every pathway that they have is shut off," Obama said.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is once again raising the specter of a bad deal with Iran as nuclear talks this week enter what could be their final stage. "This deal as far as we can see comes on almost daily concessions from the P5+1 to growing Iranian demands. Every day more concessions are made, and every day the deal becomes worse and worse," Netanyahu said Monday. "This deal will pave Iran's path to a nuclear arsenal."
