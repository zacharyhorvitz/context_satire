On February 1, 2012, J. C. Penney began a new pricing method, with "Every Day" prices on most days reflecting what used to be sale prices, "Monthly Value" for certain items every month in place of sales, and "Best Price" the first and third Fridays of each month, tied to paydays. Prices would also not end in 9 or 7 and would instead use whole figures to price items. The changes in the stores include a focus on the mini-stores such as those for Martha Stewart products. The company was purchased by JCPenney in 1968, and was expanded greatly thereafter, serving as the flagship chain of JCPenney's pharmacy group. The chain did not hide its affiliation with JCPenney, as it had JCPenney catalog merchandise pickup centers inside many of its locations, as well as signs advertising "JCPenney Catalog Center". Stores also accepted the JCPenney credit card for purchases. On February 6, 2019, JCPenney said it would stop selling major appliances on February 28 "to better meet customer expectations, improve financial performance and drive profitable growth." It will continue to sell furniture online and in Puerto Rico storesâ€”but not anywhere else. "Optimizing the allocation of store space will enable us to prioritize and focus on the company's legacy strengths in apparel and soft home furnishings, which represent higher margin opportunities," the company said in a statement.
