Japan (Japanese: 日本, Nippon  (listen) or Nihon  (listen)) is an island country located in East Asia. It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east, and spans more than 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south. Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands, with five main islands (Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, and Okinawa) comprising 97% of the country's total area of 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi). Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions.  In an elementary school turned nursing home, Keichi Tasaka jokes with a group of cheerful old women. At 70, he could be mistaken for a resident, but Tasaka isn't thinking of retiring anytime soon. Instead, the former tofu-maker is forging a second career as a caregiver to the elderly in Tokyo's Cross Hearts nursing home. "I always had an interest in care-giving and pensioners don't receive much in Japan so I'm really thankful that this opportunity existed here for me," Tasaka told CNN.
