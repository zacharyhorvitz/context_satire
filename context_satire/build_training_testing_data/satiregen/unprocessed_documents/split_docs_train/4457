The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also the Affordable Care Act or colloquially known as Obamacare, is a United States federal statute enacted by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.PPACA's major provisions came into force in 2014. By 2016, the uninsured share of the population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20 to 24 million additional people covered. The law also enacted a host of delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality.  Sorry, America: Support for emergency care patients barely receives a passing grade and needs extra help, according to a new report. The American College of Emergency Physicians, a national medical specialty society, issued a "report card" assessing the country's emergency medical services. As a whole, the United States got a measly D-plus. "This report card is saying: The nation's policies are failing to support emergency patients," Alexander Rosenau, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said Thursday.  A single mother of six, Cherelle Wright brought her 3-month-old daughter to be immunized at Community Advanced Practice Nurses, one free clinic offering medical care to Atlanta's disadvantaged. "Since I am unemployed at the moment and was in between having Medicaid insurance, I found out about this place (and) I was able to get all the immunizations that my children needed," she says. "It's a great opportunity to have health care when you are not able to afford it." With the advent of Obamacare, the health market is changing.
