In early 2009, Longfellow Middle School introduced a new academic activity called "Lancer Time," a 23-minute period at the end of the day, intended to give students time to get help from their teachers without having to stay after school. Students can also work on homework and projects from other classes. The period is also used one day a week to teach the students about values such as honesty and leadership, as well as introducing better study habits to help students prepare for their exams. Other classes, as well as hall passing time, were shortened to account for the new period. From 2015 to 2016, McElroy also co-hosted the podcast Can I Pet Your Dog? with Allegra Ringo and Renee Colvert, leaving after the 57th episode due to the fact that he was moving house and expecting a child. However, McElroy did later return as a guest star for episodes 71 and 81. McElroy also co-hosted the "doomsday prepping" comedy podcast Bunker Buddies with Andie Bolt from 2014 to 2018, at which point he retired from the show and was replaced by Ben Ellis. The late night scenes caused issues with the cast. Garlan Wilde, a gaffer for the film, was injured during the scene between Brady and the Shape when he dropped a light and accidentally slit his wrists. He was rushed to the hospital. In addition, while filming the rooftop scene, Ellie Cornell cut her stomach open on a large nail while sliding down the roof, though she continued filming the scene despite losing a sizable amount of blood.
