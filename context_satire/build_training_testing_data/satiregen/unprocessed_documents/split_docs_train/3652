A version for the Nintendo 3DS was released by NIS America on June 27, 2017. While it remains portable on a small screen, users can create games on-the-go and also download games to play as well. The game received some criticism, with NintendoWorldReport writing that "Ultimately, itâ€™s hard for me to recommend RPG Maker Fes to anyone but the most hardcore of RPG fans that have always dreamed of creating their own game." Games completed can be uploaded to the RPG Maker Fes Player app for those to download and play on their own systems. Sony Interactive Entertainment, who had presented at every E3 until E3 2019, stated they will not attend E3 in 2020 for a second year in a row, as the new vision of the show does not meet their goals, and instead they will present at a number of smaller events throughout the year. Microsoft's Xbox division has affirmed they will attend the show, where it is expected that more details of the 4th generation of the Xbox consoles, including the Xbox Series X with release planned in late 2020, will be announced. After years without substantial footage, a teaser trailer was shown during PlayStation's May 2019 State of Play broadcast. Kitase announced that the team had wanted to "try something new" on the State of Play broadcast by showing the trailer. The release date, March 3, 2020, was revealed the following month in a second teaser trailer during an orchestral concert dedicated to the music of Final Fantasy VII in Los Angeles. Further release details were announced at the company's E3 2019 press conference, including different editions of Remake.
