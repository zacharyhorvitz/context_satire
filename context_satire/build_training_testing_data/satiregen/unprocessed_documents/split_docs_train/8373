Anne Woods Patterson (born 1949) is an American diplomat and career Foreign Service Officer. She served as the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs from 2013 to 2017. She previously served as United States Ambassador to Egypt until 2013 and as United States Ambassador to Pakistan from July 2007 to October 2010. April is one of the founders of local garage band, 4Evah (later renamed 4Evah & Eva). Although by and large a decent girl, April has a problematic streak with her parents and siblings, partly due to moodiness and withdrawal from hormonal changes during her adolescence (which has also been a problem of her older brother Michael), as well as annoyance at being made to pull her own weight around the house, arguing that she should enjoy life, which is rectified by a stern rebuke from Elizabeth about how every member of the family works and helps out around the house. Both problems are largely solved when Elly puts April to work in the family business of the bookstore/toy store after school and on weekends. After visiting her aunt's farm in 2006, she begins to consider becoming a veterinarian. Police did not believe Patterson had any social media contact with Closs or her family and relatives of Closs did not recognize Patterson's name. Patterson told authorities he saw Closs getting off a school bus outside the family residence in September while he was driving home from work and that he "knew that she was the girl he wanted to take". While in jail in March, Patterson wrote a letter in response to questions sent to him by a reporter from a television station in Minneapolis. He apologized for his crimes and stated they were committed "mostly on impulse", contrasting with reports from the police that he had taken various measures in preparation for the crime.
