In 1993, Brown was hired as a color commentator for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, a role he occupied for the first six pay-per-view events. For his horse riding role as Jim Ryan in the Australian musical theatre production of The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular, Crewes, who could already ride, was given intensive riding lessons by expert riding teacher Steve Jefferys so that he would not require a body double for the difficult riding feats he had to accomplish in the show. Jefferys also taught Crewes the difficult art of being a horse whisperer. Horse whispering usually takes years to learn, but Crewes was able to master this difficult skill in only two weeks. Recovered from an injury, Jim seeks a position on the Patna, a steamer serving the transport of 800 "pilgrims of an exacting belief" to a port on the Red Sea. He is hired as first mate. After some days of smooth sailing, the ship hits something in the night and begins taking on water. The captain thinks the ship will sink, and Jim agrees, but wants to put the passengers on the few boats before that can happen.
