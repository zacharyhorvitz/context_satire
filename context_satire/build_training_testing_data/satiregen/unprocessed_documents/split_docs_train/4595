On January 23, 2006, Hayden participated in a news conference. A YouTube video was posted of Michael Hayden telling reporters at a press conference that "probable cause" is not required for all searches or seizures under the Fourth Amendment, claiming instead that the standard is whether the search or seizure is reasonable. "Probable cause" is required for all warrants whether or not the search or seizure is deemed to be "unreasonable." Refined and adopted at the first SDS convention in  June 1962, the Port Huron Statement called for a "new left" committed, in the spirit of participatory democracy, to "deliberativeness, honesty  reflection." The sponsoring League for Industrial Democracy (LID) took immediate issue. The Statement omitted the LID's standard denunciation of communism: the regret it expressed at the "perversion of the older left by Stalinism" was too discriminating, and its references to Cold-War tensions too even handed. Hayden was called to a meeting where, refusing any further concession, he clashed with Michael Harrington (as he later would with Irving Howe). Hayden committed himself to the effort. For three years in Newark he worked with a community union to organize poor black residents to take on slumlords, city inspectors and others. He was there to witness the 1967 Newark Riots which in Rebellion in Newark (1967) he tried to place in a larger social and economic context. His profile in Newark attracted the attention of the FBI.
