 Americans have one less reason to feel bad for the nation's wealthiest: they are getting richer and younger. That's right: affluent Americans aren't all reading AARP magazine at a tony golf resort. Some probably read Buzzfeed too. Call it the Mark Zuckerberg trend. Another important approach used in business school is the use of business games that are used in different disciplines such as business, economics, management, etc. Some colleges are blending many of these approaches throughout their degree programs, and even blending the method of delivery for each of these approaches. A study from by Inside Higher Ed and the Babson Survey Research Group shows that there is still disagreement as to the effectiveness of the approaches but the reach and accessibility is proving to be more and more appealing. Liberal arts colleges in the United States like New England College, Wesleyan University, and Bryn Mawr College are now offering complete online degrees in many business curricula despite the controversy that surrounds the learning method.  Millions of Americans are spending too much of their monthly income on housing. Thanks to rising costs and stagnant wage growth, nearly 40 million Americans are spending more than 30% of their income on  housing payments, property taxes and other home expenses, according to a survey of 10,000 U.S. households conducted by the Demand Institute, a non-profit think tank run by the Conference Board and Nielsen. Faring most poorly are renters, 49% of which are "cost burdened" by their monthly rent payments, the report found. That's compared to 26% of homeowners.
