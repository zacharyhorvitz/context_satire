Charlotte Connor (Laura Linney) is a matchmaker recently arrived from Chicago and Frasier's final love interest on the series. Frasier initially hires her to set him up with someone following a particularly grim period regarding his romantic prospects. Charlotte sends him on several bad dates but when they get to know each other, Frasier finds himself falling in love with her. She eventually returns his feelings, but the relationship is forced to end prematurely when Charlotte, having bought back her old business from her ex-husband, moves back to Chicago. Niles brings news of Maris' legal troubles: she has had a minor road accident, but while the police were filing the report, they came across a heap of unpaid parking tickets. Niles initially asks Martin to exert his influence, but his father refuses on principle. Roz, however, informs Niles of a man named Jerome Belasco, who "makes wishes come true". When Niles and Frasier meet this man, he quickly dispels the issue, and Niles is so happy that he promises to help Jerome "any time". In "Amanda's Journey, Part 2: Thank Goodness for Tracy Strauss", Tracy finds in a road a runaway Amanda, who is in the search for her mother, Lydia. She gives Amanda a ride so she can catch the bus she missed earlier. Later, Amanda uses her ability to stop two robbers in a car, but her power gets out of control and nearly kills them; in that moment Tracy returns and freezes the fire. Tracy agrees to teach her how to control her ability while she takes Amanda to her destiny, the "Sullivan Bros. Carnival".
