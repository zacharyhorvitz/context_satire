Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said that the company is "changing our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers' devices in these circumstances." On July 23, 2009, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos posted on Amazon's official Kindle forum an apology about the company's handling of the matter. Bezos said the action was "stupid", and that the executives at Amazon "deserve the criticism received". The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon is a 2013 book written by journalist Brad Stone. It documents the rise of Amazon.com. While a bestseller it received its first one-star review on Amazon from MacKenzie Bezos, then wife of Jeff Bezos, claiming many inaccuracies in her extensive review, while pointing out only one, the timing of Jeff Bezos reading the novel Remains of the Day. Stone was allowed access to many current and former Amazon executives, but not to anyone directly associated with Bezos himself. In January 2019, Pecker's National Enquirer published what it called “sleazy text messages and gushing love notes” between Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and a romantic partner. Bezos began investigating how his personal communications reached the paper. The next month, Bezos accused the  National Enquirer of extortion and blackmail by threatening to release Bezos' intimate pictures, criminal accusations Pecker denied through an attorney. Bezos wrote that AMI proposed in writing that Bezos state publicly that he and his security consultant “have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.” In return, AMI would withhold publication of the pictures.
