Clark resides in New York City. A 2014 Village Voice profile of Clark describes her as a private person. David Byrne, with whom Clark collaborated and toured, said of Clark, "Despite having toured with her for almost a year, I don't think I know her much better, at least not on a personal level... mystery is not a bad thing for a beautiful, talented young woman (or man) to embrace. And she does it without seeming to be standoffish or distant." In "Going To War", during an intense fire at an apartment complex, Stella was severely injured after she ran out of oxygen. She was trying to help Severide and didn’t tell Hermann when her levels dropped, and ended up in Chicago Med in critical condition. Severide lashed out at Hermann for not looking out for her, and Hermann said she was trying to save him which is why she didn’t say anything. Connor Rhodes and Ethan Choi informed Severide they would have to remove part of Stella’s lung to save her. Severide's relationship with Stella becomes strained when he distances himself from her following the death of his father. In "Always a Catch", Severide becomes jealous of Stella's friend, causing even more of a strain on their relationship. In "Inside These Walls", Stella breaks up with Severide, stating that she had already been the lifeline of a man who was having a breakdown and that she could not go through that again. They get back together in "I'm Not Leaving You", where Severide says that she deserves someone better, and he was going to be that someone.
