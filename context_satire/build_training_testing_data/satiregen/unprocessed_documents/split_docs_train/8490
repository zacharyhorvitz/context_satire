 Some Pentagon officials believe Russia is testing President Donald Trump with aggressive moves across the globe. Moscow recently deployed a banned land-based cruise missile, dispatched a spy ship up the Atlantic coast and buzzed an American warship in the Black Sea. "They were likely intended to test the new administration," one defense official told CNN. "The Russians are doing different things to see how the new administration will respond," a second defense official added.  High-level advisers close to then-presidential nominee Donald Trump were in constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to US intelligence, multiple current and former intelligence, law enforcement and administration officials tell CNN. President-elect Trump and then-President Barack Obama were both briefed on details of the extensive communications between suspected Russian operatives and people associated with the Trump campaign and the Trump business, according to US officials familiar with the matter.

The communications were intercepted during routine intelligence collection targeting Russian officials and other Russian nationals known to US intelligence.  When President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin shared a phone call the weekend after Trump's inauguration, Russian news media delighted in covering every detail in near wall-to-wall coverage. The optimism in Russia since Trump's victory has at times seemed tangible. So how extraordinary, then, that Trump's remarkable 75-minute press conference has been barely mentioned on Russian television. Further to this, a Kremlin spokesman said Friday that Russia had "more important things" to do that watch the Trump event on Thursday.
