 President Barack Obama called on Sunday for "calm reflection" following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. The president, in a written statement, acknowledged an emotionally charged climate but concluded that "we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken." Obama called Martin's death a tragedy for America. "I know this case has elicited strong passions. In July, President Obama made comments about the death of Martin after the acquittal of Zimmerman. He said, "I think it would be useful for us to examine some state and local laws to see ... if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case, rather than defuse potential altercations." The President also talked about his experiences of being an African-American man in this country and a history of racial disparities in the law and how it's applied to the African-American community, in everything from the death penalty to drug laws. The President said it was those experiences that affected how the African-American community interpreted what happened that night in Florida.  Musician Stevie Wonder has vowed to stay out of Florida until the state repeals its "stand your ground" law. The law allows people to meet "force with force" if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant. "I decided today that until the 'stand your ground' law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again," Wonder told the audience at a concert in Quebec on Sunday night. "As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world."
