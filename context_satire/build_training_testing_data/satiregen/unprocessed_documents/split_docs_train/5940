 Seven American service members were among the 11 people killed in a helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan on Thursday, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. Three members of the Afghan National Security Forces and an Afghan civilian interpreter also died in the crash of the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. Some of the U.S. troops killed are believed to be special operations forces, according to Pentagon officials. The cause of the crash is under investigation, ISAF said.  The uptick in attacks by Afghan security forces against coalition troops has hit home, with all troops at NATO headquarters and all bases across Afghanistan now ordered to carry loaded weapons around the clock, CNN learned Friday. Gen. John Allen, the NATO commander in Afghanistan, ordered the move, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the orders. The order, made in recent days, was divulged amid two more so-called green-on-blue or insider attacks Friday. An Afghan police officer opened fire on U.S. troops in Farah province in southwestern Afghanistan, killing two service members, the NATO-led command said.  Shrapnel from indirect rocket fire Tuesday damaged the plane that had carried the top U.S. military officer to Afghanistan, officials said. Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was in his room on the base at the time of the incident and was "not in any danger," said his spokesman, Col. David Lapan. It's a reminder that "there's no place in Afghanistan that's safe," said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, which tracks security issues. Dempsey arrived in Afghanistan Monday for meetings with coalition and Afghan leaders, including Gen. John Allen, commander of NATO forces, and Afghan Army Gen. Sher Mohammad Karimi, Dempsey's counterpart in the country.
