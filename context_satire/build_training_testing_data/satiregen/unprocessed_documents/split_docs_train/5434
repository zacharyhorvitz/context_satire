 Two brothers who traveled to Houston to rescue victims of Hurricane Harvey said Thursday that it had been beautiful to see people come together to help those in need. On Sunday, Jonathan and Joshua Evola drove 200 miles from their homes in Dallas to help Houstonians after seeing footage of the devastating flooding on television. Since then, they've helped rescue dozens from the floodwaters, which have raged since Harvey dropped 50 inches of rain on parts of Texas in just four days. "It just didn't feel right laying on the couch and watching Houston suffer," Joshua Evola explained to CNN's Erin Burnett on her show, "Out Front."  It wasn't just wind and rain that caused damage when Hurricane Harvey blasted through the Texas coast. Fires did their share too. A family in Robstown, just west of Corpus Christi, lost their homes to a fire just as Harvey was hitting the area. The Rojas family had evacuated their three houses on property they own.  J.C. and Karen Spencer call in their breakfast order to their local Houston Chick-fil-A every day. On Monday morning, they had a slightly different request: Instead of the usual, they asked for a boat to rescue them from their flooded home. It was by mere coincidence that the Spencers even got someone on the line. The restaurant was closed because of Hurricane Harvey.
