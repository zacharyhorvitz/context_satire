 US Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte apologized Friday for his behavior with three of his teammates over the weekend at a Rio de Janeiro gas station, where police said at least one of the men vandalized the business and urinated on the premises. Lochte had originally said that he and fellow swimmers James Feigen, Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz were pulled over in their taxi and robbed at gunpoint early Sunday, but police deny a robbery took place. Can Brazil get Ryan Lochte extradited? "I wanted to apologize for my behavior last weekend -- for not being more careful and candid in how I described the events of that early morning and for my role in taking the focus away from the many athletes fulfilling their dreams of participating in the Olympics," he said Friday on Instagram.  Brazilian police say Ryan Lochte, the US swimmer with 12 career Olympic medals, has some explaining to do. They contend the story that he told about him and three teammates getting robbed early Sunday in Rio de Janeiro is a lie. What really happened, police say, is one or more of the swimmers vandalized a gas station bathroom and urinated on the premises before armed security guards confronted them. An exchange of money between the athletes and guards, they say, was to pay for the damage done.  An international incident brewed all week after the reported robbery of four U.S. Olympic swimmers at gunpoint by men dressed as police during a night out in Rio de Janeiro.
