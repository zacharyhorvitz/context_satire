 Eric Trump previewed his Republican convention speech to CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday, saying his prime-time address will focus on why the country needs his father in the White House. "I wrote my speech from the heart and I spent a lot of time on it," Trump told Blitzer, pledging to be both genuine and passionate during his remarks Wednesday night. "I care about the subject matter, I care about him." Trump's older brother, Donald Jr., and half-sister, Tiffany, spoke Tuesday night and daughter Ivanka will address the convention on Thursday night to introduce her father before his main address.  Hillary Clinton on Tuesday slammed the first day of the Republican National Convention as "surreal," comparing it to the "Wizard of Oz" while avoiding mentioning Melania Trump's plagiarism controversy. Clinton, who didn't watch much of the convention proceedings because she was flying from Minneapolis to Las Vegas, told public service employees at the AFSCME convention in Las Vegas that she made the comparison after hearing about delegate protests on the floor and some of the speeches. "I kept thinking, 'What's this like?' And then I thought, you know, when I was a little girl, I went to see ... 'The Wizard of Oz,' " Clinton said. Perceived to be criticism of the Republican Party's plan to reform Medicare for the 2012 United States federal budget, the comments were met with backlash from the GOP and various political pundits. Sarah Palin, former Governor of Alaska and the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, defended the former Speaker of the House on the Fox News Channel show Hannity, stating Gingrich was a victim of gotcha journalism and that his apology was forced by the "lamestream media". Gingrich later said on CBS News's Face the Nation that he was not referring to Ryan but to a general principle "that neither party should impose on the American people something that they are deeply opposed to."
