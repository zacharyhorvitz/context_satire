 Donald Trump spokesman Jason Miller defended the Republican presidential nominee's campaign in the wake of a recent Bloomberg Businessweek report that quotes a senior Trump campaign official as saying, "We have three major voter suppression operations under way." CNN's Jake Tapper pushed Miller on the story Thursday, asking, "Isn't Mr. Trump and your campaign doing exactly what he is decrying on the campaign trail?"

Vice President Joe Biden tore into Donald Trump in Cleveland, warning Monday of a "nightmare" presidency if the Republican nominee is elected. "We all know the nightmare of a Trump presidency," Biden said while surprising a group of volunteers at a campaign office for Hillary Clinton. "I've given up on talking about Trump." Biden, while making clear his disdain for Trump, was confident in telling the volunteers, "Hillary's going to win this election," and urged them to continue their work in the final days of the campaign.  South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said in a radio interview Monday that she is voting for Donald Trump out of concern over presidential appointments, but added that she disagrees with his divisive rhetoric and holds her breath every day  "wondering what he's gonna say." "Every day I hold my breath wondering what he's gonna say, I mean, I do," Haley said on WIBC radio's 93.1 FM. Earlier in the interview, the governor discussed blowback she received from fellow Republicans for saying at a news conference last week that a vote for Trump was not an "easy vote."
