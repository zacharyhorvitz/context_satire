 Companies in the front line of the trade war between the United States and China are anxious about what comes next. Executives at a World Economic Forum event in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin have been digesting the dramatic escalation in the conflict this week. Some appear relaxed, some worried, while others are hoping for the best. The Trump administration launched its biggest barrage of tariffs against China early Tuesday.  In August 1988, nine men met in Osama Bin Laden's house in Peshawar, Pakistan, to start a group that would end up playing a dramatic role in shaping the United States of the early 21st century. They called the group al-Qaeda, which means "the base" in Arabic. As a result of its terrorist activities, the US would see the most lethal attack ever on its homeland, would embark on a war that has already lasted for 17 years, would spend an estimated $2.8 trillion to protect itself from attack, according to a recent Stimson Center report, and would see its politics changed in fundamental ways that endure today. In the wake of that founding meeting, al Qaeda records show, the "work of al-Qaeda commenced on September 10, 1988," 30 years ago Monday.  The United States has expressed concern over China's "worsening crackdown" on minority Muslim groups in the far western province of Xinjiang, amid allegations of widespread human rights abuses. Rights groups have accused Beijing of the systematic mass detention of tens of thousands of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in political re-education camps without being charged or tried. The allegations have prompted a growing international outcry and calls for sanctions to be imposed on senior Chinese officials. On Tuesday, US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said the US government was "deeply troubled" by the crackdown, saying there were "credible reports" of thousands being detained in detention centers since April 2017.
