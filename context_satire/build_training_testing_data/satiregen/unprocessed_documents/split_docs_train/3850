The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 appropriated funding for the Interstate Highway System, to construct a vast network of freeways across the country. By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the west) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates. Major decommissioning of former routes began with California's highway renumbering in 1964. US 34 was one of the original U.S. Highways when the system was created in 1926, though it was preceded by the Blue Grass Route, which was a 310-mile-long (500 km) route that connected Council Bluffs and Burlington. In 1920, the Iowa State Highway Commission assigned route numbers to roads in order to improve wayfinding for travelers. The Blue Grass Route was assigned Primary Road No. Eisenhower advocated for the highways for the purpose of national defense. In the event of a ground invasion by a foreign power, the U.S. Army would need good highways to be able to transport troops and material across the country efficiently. Following completion of the highways the cross-country journey that took the convoy two months in 1919 was cut down to five days.
