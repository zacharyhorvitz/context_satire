Rickel decided, as they had tried once before, to use their size to their advantage and define themselves as more of a neighborhood home center. Since both Rickel and Home Depot sold many of the same items, Rickel's strategy was to portray the stores as much easier to shop at than the immense Home Depot stores. The attempt did little, if anything, to either take business from Home Depot or lure customers to Rickel and in August 1997, a plan to allow the chain to remain open until at least February 1998 was rejected. Despite its best efforts, it now seemed that it was no longer a matter of if the still-in-bankruptcy Rickel could reverse its fortunes and stave off its demise but instead a matter of how much time the former home improvement stalwart had left before it would be forced to close its doors for good. Rickel certainly was not in a good position as even though their store was in a centralized location, the Home Depot store would siphon away a significant amount of their customers. After all, Home Depot's market share in New Jersey was continuing to rise and demand for new stores rose with it. Before, Home Depot and Rickel had been able to coexist somewhat as there were not as many stores in direct competition with each other. By 1995, however, that was no longer the case as Home Depot was simply building stores wherever they felt like doing so; with Rickel still in some significant financial distress, the company felt the need to take action to protect itself. The ongoing spat with Home Depot finally came to a head in July 1995, when Rickel was sued by Home Depot in a New Jersey state court. At the time of the dispute, Home Depot was looking to build a large store on a plot of land situated on Orange Street in Bloomfield, New Jersey near the Watsessing train station and Exit 148 of the Garden State Parkway. Rickel once again cried foul, and this time it was due to what they perceived to be a large encroachment on their territory.
