John Grainger asks an old friend from Maryland to come to Shiloh to take the rough edges off his grandkids. She does as he asks quite well but is less than popular with the kids and The Virginian. Unknown to them, she has a secret plan. Although some question his guilt, a man is hanged in Medicine Bow when a woman denies being with him at the time. A stranger with many talents arrives in Medicine Bow and takes a job at Shiloh; he takes a keen interest in the main players. As described in a film magazine, Amanda "Darcy" Cole (Burke) is a normal young woman with a pleasing personality who, strangely enough, has no suitors. Her friends announce their engagements from time to time and each announcement giving her added cause for alarm. Gloria Green (Linden), an ardent physical culturist, tells Darcy where she is lax and she immediately begins training to improve her appearance. In the meantime she feigns an engagement with an unidentified Englishman.
