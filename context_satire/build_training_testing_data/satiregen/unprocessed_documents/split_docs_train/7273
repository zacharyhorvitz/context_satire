His previous book was a memoir about his childhood that is about to get released. At the release party, he is reading from his book talking about how his late father hurt and abused him and his father Neil Elliott stands up in the crowd and calls him a liar. This causes him to question his childhood memories. In despair, he gets high and goes to a club and sleeps with a random person. Hales has talked about how he was diagnosed with ADD many times and released a documentary video about Adderall on August 8, 2016. He mentioned he was prescribed Adderall about 6 months before he started his channel and said he has never seen the doctor who diagnosed him with ADD again. He also said that Adderall is the reason behind all his videos, but mentioned he doesn't want to talk about the subject because he doesn't take treatment any more. Later, in his memoir Pieces of My Heart, Wagner acknowledged that he had had an argument with Wood before she disappeared. The autopsy found that Wood's blood alcohol content was 0.14% (the upper limit for driving a car legally was 0.10% in California at the time), and there were traces of two types of medication in her bloodstream: a motion-sickness pill and a painkiller, both of which increase the effects of alcohol. Two witnesses, who had been on a boat nearby, stated they had heard a woman scream for help during the night. Following his investigation, Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi ruled her death an accident by drowning and hypothermia.
