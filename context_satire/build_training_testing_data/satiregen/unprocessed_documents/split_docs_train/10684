 SpaceX has finally launched its mission to resupply the International Space Station after a series of delays. A Falcon 9 rocket, carrying an uncrewed Dragon 1 spacecraft stuffed will cargo, took of from Cape Canaveral, Florida on Saturday just before 3 a.m. ET. This is usually a routine task for SpaceX.  The six astronauts aboard the International Space Station can rest easy: Full power has been restored to the orbiting laboratory. Electrical problems left the space station running on about 75% its normal power supply, delaying SpaceX's latest uncrewed resupply mission to the ISS. The rocket company was supposed to drop off a bundle of hardware and supplies this week. But the launch was called off as the crew worked to restore the station's full power supply.  After more than a week of speculation, SpaceX confirmed that its Crew Dragon spacecraft was "destroyed" during a recent test fire. That could seriously derail the company's plans to begin flying astronauts to the International Space Station this year. Crew Dragon had a great start to 2019, and it executed an uncrewed demo flight in March during which it docked with the space station and returned safely home. But on April 20, the spacecraft was undergoing a "series of engine tests" at a facility in Cape Canaveral when something went wrong during the final stretch.
