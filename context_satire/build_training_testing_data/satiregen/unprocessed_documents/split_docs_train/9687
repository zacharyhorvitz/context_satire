 Greta Thunberg doesn't mince words. Not even when addressing the world's most powerful people. "We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth," the Swedish climate activist told the United Nations General Assembly on Monday. "How dare you?"  President Donald Trump mocked Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg on Twitter late Monday night after the 16-year-old excoriated world leaders for not doing enough to tackle the climate crisis. "She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!" Trump posted on Twitter, replying to a video of Thunberg's speech at the United Nations climate action summit earlier in the day.  Before Greta Thunberg captured the world's attention with her rousing speech on the climate crisis, the 16-year-old activist already had a packed schedule. This week, the Swedish teen delivered a commanding address at the United Nations Climate Action Summit. Last week, she organized a global climate strike across 139 countries. She was even nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.
