Handley held clear views on the style of conductors, saying "Music isn't mime; you shouldn't fraudulently convince people that they have heard what they haven't", and stating "jet-set musical careers... are little to do with the work, more to do with PR". Questioning the influence of television on conducting, Handley recalled Boult telling him, "Do remember, won't you, that you are playing to the blind man in the audience." Morss lived in Bradley Stoke on the outskirts of Bristol where he co-owned and ran a minicab firm. Morss and Tyler fled to the Philippines after Handley's death, but when Morss returned to England, the child's body had been found and he was quickly arrested on suspicion of murder. Tyler had to be extradited back to England to stand trial. One of the killers later recalled "the feeling of sexual excitement when I grabbed his body and pushed him into the car, the fear of being caught and the excitement that we might get away with it. Handley was fixing a chain on his bicycle in Beckton, London, on 2 October 1994, when he was approached by two men in a Peugeot 405. The men had been cruising the area looking for a young, pre-teen, fair haired boy to make real their fantasy of abducting such a boy, sexually abusing him and then killing him. The driver of the car claimed to be lost, and asked Handley to show him directions on a map. The map was placed across the back seat of the car and, when Daniel leaned inside to look at it, one of the men pushed him into the car and the other drove them off.
