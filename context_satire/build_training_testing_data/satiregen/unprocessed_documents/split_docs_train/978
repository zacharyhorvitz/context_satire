 In President Donald Trump's mind, the release this week of Robert Mueller's findings is a moment to mark his long-proclaimed innocence. In the minds of some current and former White House officials, the moment isn't quite as rosy. They are dreading Thursday's publication of the more-than-300 page report, several of them told CNN in recent days, even as the President himself has told aides and friends he is eager to see his name cleared. While few people close to Trump are predicting any bombshells, there is a sense of apprehension among advisers because they believe the full report will provide the closest and most credible account to date of tumult and chaos inside the West Wing.  Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report is nearly 400 pages long. As a real-world reference point, the Modern Classics version of "To Kill a Mockingbird" runs 384 pages. Even if Attorney General William Barr makes so many color-coded redactions to Mueller's report that it looks like a pack of Skittles exploded, do not expect a standard law enforcement investigative recap. We are about to get hit with a novel-length tome.  After years of investigating, 500 witnesses interviewed and a metric ton of ink spilled, Congress and the public is set to get its first real look at special counsel Robert Mueller's report Thursday morning. The report is said to be nearly 400 pages and cover subjects ranging from questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election to whether President Donald Trump committed potentially impeachable offenses.
