Justin's late nights in front of his computer and escalating addiction soon impact his lap times. He betrays Amy's trust by downloading porn onto her PDA. Then, he exposes his younger brother, Alex, (who's only 11) to porn. This left him feeling queasy. In April 2012, while Kick-Ass 2 was still in pre-production Mark Millar stated that a third film was also planned. In June 2013, however, he revealed that it was not confirmed and would be dependent on how successful the second film was. Later the same month he further elaborated that if it went ahead, the third film would be the final installment: "Kick-Ass 3 is going to be the last one... I told Universal this and they asked me, ‘What does that mean?’ I said, ‘It means that this is where it all ends.’ They said, ‘Do they all die at the end?’ I said, ‘Maybe’ – because this is a realistic superhero story... if someone doesn't have a bullet proof vest like Superman, and doesn't have Batman’s millions, then eventually he is going to turn around the wrong corner and get his head kicked in or get shot in the face. However, it does not stop him. While trying to write a history paper on the school's library computer, Justin goes to the extent of using it to access porn (using his USB Drive). Eventually, he gets caught hacking the internet firewall by the school librarian. This action led to his suspension from the swim team and being placed on overall probation.
