 As the voiture rolled through the dark streets that wintry night, the sad story of Oscar Wilde was in part repeated to me... Robert Ross knelt by the bedside, assisting me as best he could while I administered conditional baptism, and afterwards answering the responses while I gave Extreme Unction to the prostrate man and recited the prayers for the dying. As the man was in a semi-comatose condition, I did not venture to administer the Holy Viaticum; still I must add that he could be roused and was roused from this state in my presence. When roused, he gave signs of being inwardly conscious... Indeed I was fully satisfied that he understood me when told that I was about to receive him into the Catholic Church and gave him the Last Sacraments... And when I repeated close to his ear the Holy Names, the Acts of Contrition, Faith, Hope and Charity, with acts of humble resignation to the Will of God, he tried all through to say the words after me.  The films nominated for the Best Picture Oscar on Thursday may be critically acclaimed, but they didn't do much at the box office, and that could present a ratings challenge for ABC, the network broadcasting the awards. The eight movies in the running made a combined $231 million at this year's box office. That figure pales in comparison to the combined $809 million which last year's nine nominated films made. One of last year's nominees ("Gravity") made $274 million at the U.S. box office.  Unlike its featured song, everything is not awesome for "The Lego Movie." When Oscar nominations for this year's Best Animation Feature were announced on Thursday, the film about the beloved toys was nowhere to be found. "No Lego Movie? That's ridiculous," tweeted Steven Zeitchik, Entertainment Writer for the Los Angeles Times.
