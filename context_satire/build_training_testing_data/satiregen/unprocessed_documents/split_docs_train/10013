 Researchers in the U.S. have created the world's first litter of puppies through in vitro fertilization (IVF), a breakthrough they say could help eradicate diseases in dogs -- and in humans. Seven puppies were born in July from 19 embryos implanted into a host female dog, according to scientists from Cornell University and the Smithsonian Institution. "Since the mid-1970s, people have been trying to do  in a dog and have been unsuccessful," co-author Alex Travis, associate professor of reproductive biology at the Baker Institute for Animal Health in Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine said in a statement. Past attempts have failed because dogs have different reproductive systems to most mammals. Cornell scientists have researched the fundamental particles of nature for more than 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as Hans Bethe, contributed not only to the foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the Manhattan Project (see also: List of Cornell Manhattan Project people). In the 1930s, Cornell built the second cyclotron in the United States. In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study synchrotron radiation. In 1873, the cornerstone of Sage Hall was laid. This new hall was to house the Sage College for Women and thus to concretely establish Cornell University's coeducational status. Ezra Cornell wrote a letter for posterity—dated May 15, 1873—and sealed it into the cornerstone. No copies of the letter were made, and Cornell kept its contents a secret.
