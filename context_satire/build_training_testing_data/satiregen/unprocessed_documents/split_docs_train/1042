 The French have turned to fiction to help them mourn Notre Dame. Victor Hugo's "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" has become the best-selling book on Amazon France after part of the 856-year-old cathedral was destroyed by a massive fire Monday evening. A different edition of the same novel, known as "Notre-Dame de Paris" or "Our Lady of Paris" in French, is the site's second best-selling book as of Tuesday afternoon. The 1831 novel tells the love story of a street dancer and the church's bell ringer in medieval Paris and is credited with inspiring one of the church's most important restorations.  A catastrophic fire engulfed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on Monday, altering the city's skyline and threatening a potent symbol of Catholicism at the start of Holy Week. The fire burned for several hours, destroying the 850-year-old cathedral's iconic spire and roof before firefighters contained the blaze early Tuesday morning. A pair of bell towers immortalized in Victor Hugo's tale "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" survived, along with the cathedral's elaborate stonework facade. Officials said invaluable artifacts were saved, including the Crown of Thorns, believed to be a relic of the passion of Christ.  The vast fire that ripped through Paris' venerable Notre Dame cathedral has struck directly at the soul of France. No single catastrophic event has bit so deeply into the core of the cathedral and its soaring spire as Monday's fire that lit up the city skyline. As thousands lined the banks of the Seine to gaze up at the flames, there were few words to convey their fear that a central part of the French national identity and eight centuries of its precious history had been lost in a single transcendent moment. I share their sentiment.
