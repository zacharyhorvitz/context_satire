Some sources give Dean's last known words — uttered right before the impact when Wütherich told Dean to slow down as the Ford Tudor pulled into their lane —  as, "That guy's gotta stop ... He'll see us". Raskin believes that any report about Dean and Wütherich communicating prior to the crash is pure conjecture. According to the coroner's deposition taken of Wütherich in the hospital, and later in a 1960 interview given to an official Porsche magazine, Christophorus, he could not recall any of the exact moments leading up to and after the crash. Purportedly, Dean had been given the nickname "Little Bastard" by Bill Hickman, a Warner Bros. stunt driver whom Dean befriended. Hickman was part of Dean's group driving to the Salinas Road Races on September 30, 1955. Hickman says he called Dean "little bastard", and Dean called Hickman "big bastard". Another version of the "Little Bastard" origin — corroborated by two of Dean's close friends, Phil Stern and Lew Bracker — is that Warner Bros. president Jack L. Warner had once referred to Dean as a little bastard after he refused to vacate his temporary East of Eden trailer on the studio's lot. The official sheriff-coroner called for an inquest, held at the council chambers in San Luis Obispo on October 11, 1955, where Turnupseed told the jury that he did not see the low-profile Spyder until after he was turning left onto Route 41. After other testimony by the CHP and witnesses, the coroner's jury came back with a verdict of "accidental death with no criminal intent", finding Turnupseed not guilty of any contributory wrongdoing in the death of Dean.
