Wells sought a federal judgeship, but was unsuccessful. As an attorney with former governor Henry A. Wise (who had opposed Negro suffrage) in the April 1870 trial to decide whether George Chahoon or Henry K. Ellyson had become Richmond's mayor, Wells was among 300 people in attendance at the Court of Appeals session in Richmond on April 27, 1870. An overcrowded balcony collapsed, as did the courtroom's floor, which both fell into the hall of the Virginia House of Delegates. Wells then moved to Washington, D.C. and resumed a private legal practice. He served as United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from September 1875 until January 1880. He then resumed a private legal practice with his son Henry Hunt Wells, who had been his deputy U.S. Attorney, but who died in early 1894. Meanwhile, Wells had helped found the American Bar Association in 1878. In an interview in 2005, the New York Times writer observed that McDonagh "now seems more comfortably resigned to the storytelling powers of drama, if still dismissive of its inherent elitism. 'It's kind of weird working in an art form that's not, well ...,' he stops and starts again. 'It's strange to be working in an art form that costs $100 to participate in.'" In an interview with Sean O'Hagan of The Guardian, McDonagh said theatre "is never going to be edgy in the way I want it to be", when discussing his absence from London theatre and promoting his new play Hangmen.
