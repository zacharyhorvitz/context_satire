 Former GOP House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said Tuesday that Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore doesn't deserve to win the special election in Alabama. "I think he deserves to lose," Cantor told CNN's "New Day." "And when I was in office as majority leader, I had the policy of zero tolerance for any of this kind of stuff." Moore has been accused of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s.  Sen. Jeff Flake tweeted a picture Tuesday afternoon that is the most visible sign yet that his break from the Trump-led Republican Party may not only be permanent but also could lead to a national bid for the Arizona Republican down the line: The check is made out to Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee against Roy Moore in next Tuesday's Alabama special election to fill the Senate seat of now Attorney General Jeff Sessions. And it carries the now-familiar refrain of the anti-Trump wing of the GOP: "County over party."

"It doesn't make any sense. If you believe the victims, you don't give money to the candidates," the Nebraska Republican told reporters on Wednesday after the RNC resumed its support for Moore. "It's pretty obvious that these political parties stink.
