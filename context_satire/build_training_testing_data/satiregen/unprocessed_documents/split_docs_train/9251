She's All That is a 1999 American teen romantic comedy film directed by Robert Iscove and starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Rachael Leigh Cook, Paul Walker and Matthew Lillard. It is a modern adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion and George Cukor's 1964 film My Fair Lady. It was one of the most popular teen films of the late 1990s and reached No. 1 at the box office in its first week of release. Kevin Pollak said he signed up for the movie in part because he was impressed with Freddie Prinze, Jr., in The House of Yes a few years earlier and was interested to work with him. Prinze's mother wrote a book about her son, The Freddie Prinze Story (1978). Can You Hear the Laughter? The Story of Freddie Prinze (September 1979) is a TV biopic. Prinze's life and death were a focal point of one of the storylines in the movie Fame (1980), set in Prinze's alma mater, the LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts.
