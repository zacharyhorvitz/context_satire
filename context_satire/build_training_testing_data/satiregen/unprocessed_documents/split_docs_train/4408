Speaking of his "overnight success" through Good Will Hunting, Damon said by that time he had been working in the cinema for 11 years, but still found the change "nearly indescribableâ€”going from total obscurity to walking down a street in New York and having everybody turn and look". Before the film, Damon played the lead in the critically acclaimed drama, The Rainmaker (1997), where he was recognized by the Los Angeles Times as "a talented young actor on the brink of stardom." For the role, Damon gained most of the weight he had lost for Courage Under Fire. After meeting Damon on the set of Good Will Hunting, director Steven Spielberg cast him in the brief title role in the 1998 World War II film Saving Private Ryan. Damon was part of the all-star cast assembled by Kimmel for his 2012 Oscars parody, which was a mock trailer for a non-existent blockbuster called Movie: The Movie. Damon appears briefly in a full grape suit, only to be informed his scene had been cut from the "film" after which he is shown storming out of the studio (as part of the trailer), cursing at Kimmel.  Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel showered the audience with sweet treats, made a group of tourists' Hollywood dreams come true, and even tried to save the night following a historic blunder. But it was his ongoing faux-feud with Matt Damon that was truly worthy of gold Sunday night. Kimmel kicked off his night of Damon torment with a nod to the actor -- who has long been a playful target of Kimmel's --  in his monologue. "Tonight in the spirit of bringing people together, I would like to bury the hatchet with someone I've had issues with -- Matt Damon," he said.
