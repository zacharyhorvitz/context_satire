 A student opening fire with a handgun he took from his parents. Screaming students running for cover. A teacher, trying to help, shot dead. Two students wounded.  Call it coincidental or a call for alarm: Two teachers in two states killed at school days apart, each allegedly by a student. The nation is searching for meaning and answers after teacher slayings in Nevada and Massachusetts this week. And an education firm says the crimes are the latest examples of how educators feel schools are less of a traditional haven, especially from gun violence that killed one of the instructors. A survey of 10,600 educators in 50 states captured this uneasiness after another school shooting -- in Newtown, Connecticut -- when the vast majority of respondents favored an armed guard to improve safety, though they didn't want to be armed in school themselves.  It didn't surprise Reggie Landsberry that his brother was reportedly trying to stop a student with a handgun from shooting  when he was killed. Math teacher Mike Landsberry was killed in the shooting at Sparks Middle School by a student who brought a semiautomatic weapon. The student also wounded two 12-year-old students. A witness told the Reno Gazette-Journal that Landsberry intervened at one point.
