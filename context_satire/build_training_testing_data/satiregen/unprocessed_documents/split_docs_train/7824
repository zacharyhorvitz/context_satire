The Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland provides guidance for future precipitation amounts and areas where excessive rainfall is likely, while local NWS offices are responsible for issuing Flood Watches, Flash Flood Watches, Flood Warnings, Flash Flood Warnings, and Flood Advisories for their local County Warning Area, as well as the official rainfall forecast for areas within their warning area of responsibility. These products can and do emphasize different hydrologic issues depending on geographic area, land use, time of year, as well as other meteorological and non-meteorological factors (for example, during the early spring or late winter a Flood Warning can be issued for an ice jam that occurs on a river, while in the summer a Flood Warning will most likely be issued for excessive rainfall).  The Cape Verde Islands were under a hurricane warning Monday night as Hurricane Fred lashed the eastern Atlantic chain, bringing 75-mph winds and heavy rains, according to the National Hurricane Center. It is rare for a hurricane to form so near the African coast, and though a handful of tropical storms have formed this far east in the tropical Atlantic, Fred marks the easternmost formation of a hurricane, according to hurricane records in a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration database. (Hurricane Vince in 2005 formed at the easternmost point in the entire Atlantic.) Fred is the first hurricane to pass through the Cape Verde Islands since 1892. This station first began in 1954 as the first weather radio system in the Chicago area dedicated to the aviation user and continued until 1958 when the aviation broadcast went dark. Ivan Brunk, meteorologist in Charge of the Chicago U.S. Weather Bureau (now National Weather Service) office at that time, suggested that the radio service be reinstated and put to Marine usage on an experimental basis. The marine weather broadcast was an immediate success, and the service became permanent two years later.
