 Amid the long lines of people waiting in the Capitol Rotunda to pay their respects to former President George H.W. Bush and the outpouring of admiration for his life, it's hard to imagine that anyone could have doubted that his memorial services wouldn't be well-attended. But one person did: Bush himself, his former spokesman said Tuesday night. "Briefed in 2011 about his funeral and lying in state, the 41st President asked with typical humility, 'Do you think anyone will come?'  Former Sen. Bob Dole reflected on his decades-old friendship with the late former President, saying that his passing was an end of an era, as President George H.W. Bush was the last World War II veteran president. "IÂ believe there are certain qualities that veterans have and when Bush was president, I think about three-fourths of Congress were veterans and we would stick together and work together across the aisle. And President Bush was a bipartisan president.  US financial markets will be closed on Wednesday to honor the memory of former President George H.W. Bush, who passed away late Friday at the age of 94. The White House said Saturday President Donald Trump would declare December 5th a national day of mourning for the country's 41st president. "He and the First Lady will attend the funeral at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.," the statement said.
