The Catholic Bible is composed of the 46 books of the Old Testament and the 27 books of the New Testament. The Masoretic Text is the authoritative Hebrew text of the Hebrew Bible. It defines the books of the Jewish canon, and also the precise letter-text of these biblical books, with their vocalization and accentuation. The term 'deuterocanonical' is used by some scholars to denote the books (and parts of books) of the Old Testament which are in the Greek Septuagint collection but not in the Hebrew Masoretic Text collection. There is, in fact, only one Canon of Scripture of the Old Testament recognized by the Catholic Church and it is based on the Septuagint version of the Old Testament because, while both the Hebrew scriptures and the Septuagint were used in Palestine and elsewhere in the time of Christ, the Septuagint was used by the apostles and Early Christianity in the universal proclamation of the Gospel. Indeed, most of the quotations from the Old Testament appearing in the New Testament books are from the Septuagint, not the Hebrew scriptures: see an Appendix to the Good News Bible, listing quotations in the New Testament from the Old Testament, most of which are from the Septuagint. The Catholic Church, at the Council of Rome (382), when it settled the list of Scripture (46 books in O.T., 27 books in N.T., total 73 books), did not accept some of the books of the Septuagint as being Scripture, i.e., inspired and canonical: namely, the Book of Enoch, 3 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, and some others.
