Hyundai Motor America began selling cars in the United States on 20 February 1986, with a single model, the Hyundai Excel, which was offered in a variety of trims and body styles. That year, Hyundai set a record of selling the most automobiles in its first year of business in the United States compared to any other car brand; total sales in 1986 were 168,882. Due to the lack of right-hand-drive 5th generation Accent production in Korea, Hyundai is set to phase the Accent nameplate out of Australia once all stock is exhausted by the end of 2019. The all-new Hyundai Venue, Hyundai's new small SUV, is set to indirectly replace it. Hyundai cars, including those made by Hyundai's affiliate, Kia Motors, sold well in China until 2016, when sales fell by half, marking the start of a slump that continued into 2019, when the company announced plans to cut jobs in the region.
