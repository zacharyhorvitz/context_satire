Hendry tended to play at a steady pace. He popularized the now universal tactic of potting the blue with pace and bottom spin on the white ball to cannon into the pink, with the object being to hit the pink ball full ball to split open the pack of reds and develop them for break-building. Prior to Hendry, players would usually attempt to break the pack of reds from a pot on the black, due to the danger of the white going in off after striking the pink or the reds. Aside from his break-building consistency, Hendry's ability at long potting was crucial to his success, as was his ability to pot balls in the middle pocket during a break. Gordon originally wrote the title character with an American actor in mind. Prior to the casting of Moore, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson, Richard Dreyfuss and James Caan were all considered for the role. In addition, Alec Guinness and David Niven were considered for the role of Hobson. According to Splitsider, John Belushi was also considered for Arthur. Hendry's dominant position in snooker appeared to be on the wane, as the only ranking event he won in the 1997/1998 season was the Thailand Masters. In the 1998 Masters final at Wembley, Hendry led his good friend Mark Williams 9–6, needing just one more frame for victory. However, he then wasted numerous chances to close out the match and eventually lost 9–10 after the deciding frame went to a re-spotted black. This match is regarded by many as one of the greatest in the history of the game.
