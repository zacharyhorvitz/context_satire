 The shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise and four others at a baseball practice for Republican members of Congress on Wednesday morning in Alexandria, Virginia, was always going to quickly turn to politics. Rep. Chris Collins, one of President Donald Trump's most prominent congressional supporters, insisted that the shooting was directly tied to anti-Trump rhetoric from the left. "I can only hope that the Democrats do tone down the rhetoric," Collins said on a local radio station in upstate New York. "The rhetoric has been outrageous -- the finger-pointing, just the tone and the angst and the anger directed at Donald Trump, his supporters.  Following Wednesday's attack on the Republican congressional baseball team, many credited the quick actions of two US Capitol Police officers in preventing a further tragedy. Some GOP lawmakers are calling not only for increased security personnel, but for the right to carry guns themselves. "The ability to protect ourselves individually, rather than having to rely on someone else is something that I cherish," Rep. Jack Bergman of Michigan told CNN. "I would like the opportunity to be able to protect myself as a congressman."  Following a moving speech by Speaker Paul Ryan in the wake of the shootings at a baseball diamond that left Rep. Steve Scalise in critical condition on Wednesday morning, you might be forgiven for wondering whether the nastiness of our politics could actually change -- at least for a short time. It didn't. While Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi both spoke eloquently about our common humanity in the wake of the attacks, within hours the shooting had grown deeply political -- due in large part to the fact that the shooter, James T. Hodgkinson, expressed a number of anti-Republican and anti-Trump sentiments on his social media feeds. And now, less than 36 hours removed from the shots ringing out in Alexandria, Virginia, we are already into the condemnation stage of our all-too-predictable political process.
