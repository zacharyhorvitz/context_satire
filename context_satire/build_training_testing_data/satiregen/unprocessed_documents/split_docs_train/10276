 The most diverse field of Democratic presidential candidates in history is now boiled down to a debate stage that lacks black or Latino candidates. The Democratic National Committee on Friday unveiled the list of seven candidates who met the polling and fundraising minimums to qualify for the December 19 debate in Los Angeles. It includes one person of color: entrepreneur Andrew Yang. The announcement comes amid a labor dispute that has threatened to derail planning for the debate at Loyola Marymount University. Days before the December 2019 debate, for which Cory Booker did not qualify, he sent a petition to the other candidates' campaigns in which he urged the DNC to change the qualification requirements for the upcoming debates in 2020 so that more non-white candidates could participate. All candidates that qualified for the December debate as well as Juli√°n Castro signed the petition. The DNC rejected the request to change the qualification criteria. The petition cites the New Hampshire Democratic Party central committee which voted to urge the DNC to "lift the barriers" on participation in further debates.  Nine Democratic presidential candidates signed a letter to Democratic National Committee leaders on Saturday urging the DNC to consider changing the debate qualifications for the January and February presidential primary debates. The candidates, seven of whom have qualified for next week's debate in Los Angeles, argue in the letter that the DNC's increasing thresholds have resulted in candidates being "prematurely cut out of the nominating contest." The candidates being excluded from the debate, the letter states, "are the ones who have helped make this year's primary field historically diverse." Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is the only person of color who qualified for next week's debate.
