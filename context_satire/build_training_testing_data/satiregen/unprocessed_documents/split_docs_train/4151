On August 7, 2019, federal authorities raided seven chicken processing plants operated by Koch Foods and four other companies in Mississippi and detained 680 undocumented workers. The exact number arrested at the Koch facilities has not been specified but authorities used five buses to transfer detainees from the plant to a hangar at a nearby airbase for processing. Homeland Security Investigations has faced criticism because the raid occurred on Mississippiâ€™s first day of school. According to the mayor of Jackson, no managers or owners responsible for hiring unauthorized immigrants in such high numbers were charged. Koch was an early supporter of the Iraq War. In July 2007, Koch wrote that he was "bailing out" of his previous support for that war, due to the failure of the United States' NATO allies, and other Arab countries, to contribute to the war effort. Koch wrote, "I would support our troops remaining in Iraq if our allies were to join us. But they have made it clear they will not." His company Koch Foods has been dogged by accusations of racism and abusive working conditions.. On August 7, 2019 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided several food processing plants in Mississippi, one of which was the Morton, MS plant of Koch Foods. Three buses were used to shuttle off workers alleged of being undocumented.
