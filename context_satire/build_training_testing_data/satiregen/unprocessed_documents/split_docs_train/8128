 Democrats and allied liberal groups are on the defensive -- and cautiously weighing their next steps -- amid revelations of sexual harassment and assault by Minnesota Sen. Al Franken. On Thursday morning, the broadcaster and former model Leeann Tweeden said in an account posted to the 790 KABC website that Franken had forcibly kissed and later groped her, while she was asleep, during a USO Tour overseas in 2006. "I couldn't believe it. He groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep," Tweeden wrote.  A female radio news anchor said Thursday that Minnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken groped and "forcibly kissed" her without her consent during an overseas USO tour in 2006, two years before Franken was elected to the Senate. The revelations have prompted Franken to apologize and ignited calls for a Senate ethics investigation into Franken's behavior. Leeann Tweeden is now a morning news anchor on TalkRadio 790 KABC in Los Angeles and posted her story in a lengthy post on the station's website. "You knew exactly what you were doing," Tweeden wrote.  Minnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken's political future is decidedly dicey in the wake of reports that he forcibly kissed and groped a woman named Leeann Tweeden during a 2006 USO tour of the Middle East. Tweeden went public with her story on Thursday morning and within minutes Franken, one of the most high-profile senators in the chamber due to his past life as a successful comedian, became a ghost. He didn't attend Democrats' weekly lunch. He was nowhere to be found in the halls around the Senate chamber.
