Hospital executives from around the country began coming to Holy Cross to assess their performance and hear Studer speak about the progress made at the hospital. One of the organizations that came to Holy Cross to hear Studer speak was a team from Baptist Hospital in Pensacola, Florida. In 1996, Baptist hired Studer as its administrator and within a year he was named president of the hospital, where he worked to turn around the hospital's finances and improve patient and employee satisfaction. During his time at Baptist, employee turnover rate dropped by 18 percent and patient satisfaction at the hospital rose to the 99th percentile among all hospitals in the US. One of Studer Group's early clients was Tenet Healthcare. Studer developed Tenet's "Target 100" program, which sought 100 percent patient satisfaction. The endeavor was announced a success within two years and Studer told Fast Company the work brought Tenet's quarterly Wall Street earnings to an all-time high. However, Melissa Davis of TheStreet.com reported that aggressive Medicare billing that was possibly illegal and unethical fueled much of the growth. In the pre-Hurricane Katrina period, several years before 2010, The Times-Picayune published an anecdote stating that students at Abramson did not use their school bathrooms due to the poor conditions and instead traveled to a Taco Bell between classes in order to use the bathrooms there. The final year of operation of Abramson High was 2005.
