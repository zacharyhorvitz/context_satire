The Town of Decatur is a town located on the eastern border of Otsego County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 U.S. census, it had a population of 353. It is named for naval hero Stephen Decatur. The Museum of the American West in Los Angeles' Griffith Park was founded in 1988 as the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum featuring much of Autry's personal collection of Western art and memorabilia as well as collections of his friends and other Western film stars. Since 2004 the museum is partnered with the Southwest Museum of the American Indian and is divided into two locations, eight miles apart from each other. West played the lead role in the 2008 independent film Goodbye Solo as William, an elderly depressed man who befriends a Senegalese man in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The film received positive reviews and critic Roger Ebert remarked that "West isn't playing himself, but he evokes his character so fully that he might as well be. West's face is a map of hard living".
