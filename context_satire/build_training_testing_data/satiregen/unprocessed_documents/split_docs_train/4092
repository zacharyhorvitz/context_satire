In an August 2019 interview with The Washington Post, Donald Trump opened up about his relationship with his late brother and expressed regret over how he treated Fred Jr. and his struggle with alcoholism. Trump said Freddy's memory still shapes his life to this day, and had a huge impact on the trajectory of his own business career and life. In the interview Donald Trump said, "He was so handsome, and I saw what alcohol did to him even physicallyÂ ... and that had an impact on me, too."  On Tuesday, President Donald Trump --accompanied by his wife, Melania, and his daughter and son-in-law -- traveled to Pittsburgh to offer condolences to the victims of a shooting at a Jewish synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood. He did so despite urgings from the city's mayor to postpone his trip until the funerals for the 11 victims could be completed. And despite the fact that no members of Congress joined him on the trip. And then, on Wednesday morning, he tweeted this: "Melania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh. Trump's presidency has been marked by significant public concern about conflict of interest stemming from his diverse business ventures. In the lead up to his inauguration, Trump promised to remove himself from the day-to-day operations of his businesses. Trump placed his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. at the head of his businesses claiming they would not communicate with him regarding his interests. However, critics noted that this would not prevent him from having input into his businesses and knowing how to benefit himself, and Trump continued to receive quarterly updates on his businesses.
