 Americans have typically been optimists about the future, but when it comes to how things are going in the country, a new national survey suggests that may no longer be the case. A CNN/ORC International Poll released Thursday indicates that only 44% of Americans believe things will be going well in the country a year from now. That's down from last fall, when 55% were optimistic about the coming year, and from November, 2009, when 63% felt that way. Not surprisingly, Americans also have a gloomy view of current conditions.  Appearing Wednesday in a presidential debate in Michigan focused primarily on economic matters, Republican Herman Cain again faced down questions about the sexual harassment scandal that has engulfed his campaign and the Republican race for the White House. "Why should the American people hire a president if they feel there are character issues?" Cain was asked by one of the moderators, Maria Bartiromo of CNBC, in the early moments of the debate. The crowd at Oakland University in suburban Detroit loudly booed the question, but Cain maintained a straight face and denied that he has acted inappropriately around any woman. In brief, in 1779 the College of Philadelphia was directed by provost William Smith. One might have expected it to evolve into the "University of the State of Pennsylvania" but this did not occur. "Since the Revolutionary state legislature felt that the board of trustees led by Provost Smith contained too many suspected loyalist sympathizers, they created a new board of trustees." Thus, the University of the State of Pennsylvania was created de novo.
