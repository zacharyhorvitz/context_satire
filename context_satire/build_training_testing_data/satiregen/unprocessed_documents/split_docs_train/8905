Glynn treats prisoners of every race equally, never showing favoritism towards any specific ethnic group. (He is seen being forced to show favoritism to the Italian inmates at one point due to blackmail; similarly, he for a while took a very hard line against Latinos in the prison as a result of a Latino gang raping his daughter.) As Oz is racially divided by individual groups, several of the white inmates such as Vern Schillinger have often referred to Glynn as Oz's "Nigger Warden". Glynn states to Clayton Hughes, whom he views as a son, that he feels no sense of brotherhood toward any of the Black inmates in Oz, only towards Blacks who obey the law. Out of the election campaign, Glynn is brought more up to what has happened inside of Oz. Detective Johnny Basil turns himself in for the murder of Bruno Goergen, as his conscience kicks in and tell him to stop doing what he's doing to prove that he is not undercover. Two inmates then die, both residents of Em City and Glynn begins to get angered with Querns. McManus points out that Querns has empowered Adebisi and the Homeboys in Em City turning a blind eye to their behavior as long as order is maintained. Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film five out of five, lauding it as "a work of heart-hammering intensity and grandeur". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded it his first four-star rating of 2017 as "maybe the greatest war film ever", adding: "There's little doubt that  has, without sentimentality or sanctimony, raised  genre to the level of art...with the resonant force of an enduring screen classic." He also called it the first major Oscar contender of the year. Michael Medved awarded it four out of four and called Hardy's performance "outstanding", and the action "seamless", declaring: "This is not only the best WWII movie since Saving Private Ryan, it is very simply one of the greatest war movies ever made."
