Resident Evil Outbreak is an online game for the PlayStation 2, released in 2003, depicting a series of episodic storylines in Raccoon City set during the same time period as Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3. It was the first in the series and the first survival horror title to feature cooperative gameplay. It was followed by a sequel, Resident Evil Outbreak: File #2. Raccoon City is a metropolis located in the Arklay Mountains of the Midwestern United States that succumbed to the deadly T-virus outbreak and was consequently destroyed via a nuclear missile attack issued by the United States government. James Marcus (ジェームス・マーカス, Jēmusu Mākasu) is one of the primary antagonists in the Resident Evil Series. Years before the events of the first Resident Evil, he was one of the top virologist researchers of the Umbrella Corporation and a head of its personnel training facility, personally appointed by Ozwell E. Spencer to work with the Mother virus. In this capacity, Marcus played an integral role in developing the T-virus and the Tyrant and Nemesis programs, also conducting extensive research on leeches that led to the development of the G-virus, up until his sudden disappearance in 1988. Spencer betrayed him by sending Marcus' direct subordinates, Albert Wesker and William Birkin, to murder him and steal his research. Iran and Iraq fought the long Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s under basically the same leadership as that which existed at the time of Bush's speech, leading some to believe that the linking of the nations under the same banner was misguided. Others argued that each of the three nations in the "axis of evil" had some special characteristics which were obscured by grouping them together. Anne Applebaum wrote about the debate over North Korea's inclusion in the group.
