In "To Plea or Not to Plea", Melissa arrives at her apartment in London and finds Spencer seated at a table, with her suitcase half packed. Spencer tells her that she's sticking with her original plan to head back to Rosewood, to which Melissa comments she's barely had a chance to see her. She further adds that Veronica went out of her way to track down her friend that works at St. Andrew's, and when Spencer refuses another interview, Melissa comments that it's not like her to run away. Spencer further adds that there's a lot going on with her friends, and Toby. In "Burn This", Spencer asks her father if he can make sure Melissa contacts her because her sister hasn't been answering her calls. Peter divulges that Melissa left for London because the office needed her back, causing Spencer to ask why she'd leave right before the election. He tells her that she should stop worrying about Melissa and think about how she's going to help Veronica win the state senator elections. Later that day, Emily stumbles upon an auto shop that appears to be fixing the same car that almost ran her over. Through a flashback in "The Naked Truth", we learn that Ali's brother, Jason, once gave Melissa a ride home from Philadelphia and her father caught them kissing in his car. It is then divulged that Peter is Jason's biological father and a product of an affair he once shared with his mother, Jessica DiLaurentis. Veronica confirms that Melissa does not know about this.
