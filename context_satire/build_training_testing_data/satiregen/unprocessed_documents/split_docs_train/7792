Nieu-Bethesda (Afrikaans for New Bethesda) is a village in the Eastern Cape at the foot of the Sneeuberge, approximately 50 kilometres (31 mi) from Graaff Reinet. It was founded in 1875 as a church town, like many other Karoo villages, and attained municipal status in 1886. The name is of biblical origin (John 5:2-4) and means "place of flowing water". Bethesda is a hamlet in York Region, Ontario, Canada, in the town of Whitchurch–Stouffville. The hamlet is centred at the intersection of Warden Avenue and Bethesda Road in the south-eastern region of Whitchurch–Stouffville; it flourished around 1875.The community gained distinction with the formation of a private telephone company, the Bethesda and Stouffville Telephone Association in 1904, with 1188 users from Newmarket to Markham by 1930. The entire system was purchased by Bell Telephone in 1960. Bethesda is located in Ellicott City, Maryland within Howard County, Maryland, United States. The home is sometimes mistakenly referred to as "Dower House" because a small dower house exists on the property. A "dower" is a widow's share for life of her husband's estate, so a dower house is where a widowed mother would live when her son and his family inherited and moved into the main house. The foundation of the original house was found using ground penetrating radar to the west of the existing structure.
