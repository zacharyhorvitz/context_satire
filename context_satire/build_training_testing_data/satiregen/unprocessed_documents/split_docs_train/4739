 The chairman of the House Benghazi committee is telling other Republicans to "shut up" about Hillary Clinton. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, defended the panel's work ahead of Clinton's politically charged appearance this week. He said comments from top Republicans like House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy are wrong and that the panel isn't interested in denting the poll numbers of Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential front-runner who is set to testify publicly on Thursday. "I have told my own Republican colleagues and friends, shut up talking about things that you don't know anything about.  Members of the Select Committee on Benghazi from both political parties previewed their lines of attack or defense just hours ahead of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's testimony before the panel. Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez said Thursday that the panel has not been able to find closure regarding what happened in Libya because that was never the Republican committee members' intent. "As Kevin McCarthy himself stated, they've been able to drive her poll numbers down. That's not accidental.  Long-time Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin testified Friday in front of the House panel investigating the Benghazi attacks. Abedin, the vice chairwoman of Clinton's presidential campaign and a former top aide at the State Department, went behind closed doors for a transcribed interview -- a major difference from what Clinton herself is set to face next week in a public hearing scheduled for Thursday. After testifying, Abedin told reporters that she answered questions posed to her "to the best of my ability." "I came here today to be as helpful as I could," Abedin said, adding that she sought to "honor the service" of those who died in the attacks.
