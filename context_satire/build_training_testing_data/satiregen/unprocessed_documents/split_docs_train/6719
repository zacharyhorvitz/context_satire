Nana Komatsu has a habit of falling in love at first sight all the time, and depending on other people to help her. When her friends, and her then boyfriend, leave for Tokyo, she decides to join them a year later after having saved enough money at the age of twenty. Nana Oosaki, the other Nana, is the punk-styled lead vocalist of a band called Black Stones (BLAST for short). She had lived with her boyfriend, bassist Ren Honjou since she was 16, but when Ren is offered a chance to debut in Tokyo as a replacement member of a popular band called Trapnest, Nana chooses to continue on with BLAST and to cultivate her own career instead of following Ren, as she has too much ambition to be relegated to a rockstar's girlfriend. She eventually leaves for Tokyo at the age of twenty to start her musical career. In March 2012, Murphy revealed that the second season had been conceptualized around Jessica Lange, saying, "This will really be the Jessica Lange show so I'm very excited about it. We are designing this amazing new opposite of the Constance character for her. She and I have spoken about different things. She has a lot of ideas, and has a lot of input into her character.
