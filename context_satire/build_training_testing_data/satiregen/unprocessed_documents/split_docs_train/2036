In season 8, Frank copes with Monica's death by doing all of the meth she bequeathed to him, then having a midlife crisis where he decides to restart his life as a 21 year old, having realized that Monica was the trigger of his alcoholism and bad parenting. As a result, he becomes sober and starts going by Francis to disassociate from his past. He cleans up his hygiene up, gets a real job, makes amends with his family and friends, buys a car, and tries to be a more productive member of society. While his children believe Frank has lost it, he proves his change is genuine by protecting his family from an armed meth head who was Monica's partner, which earns him gratitude from Fiona. In season 5, in contrast to her previously moody behavior, Mandy is dressed demurely and is good natured. In episode 3, Mandy considers leaving with Kenyatta for Indiana to "clean port-a-potties". Ian and Lip try to convince her not to go. However, during sex, Lip tells Mandy she is "gorgeous, sweet, funny, very smart, and a good person". Francis "Frank" Gallagher (William H. Macy and, in flashbacks, Jacob DeMonte-Finn) aged 52, is the father of six children. He is a deadbeat alcoholic and drug addict who relies on his children to barely get by. He also swindles the state welfare system and has taught this type of opportunistic deceit to his children. Since Frank refuses to work and most of the children are underage, the family lives far below the federal poverty threshold for a family of their size.
