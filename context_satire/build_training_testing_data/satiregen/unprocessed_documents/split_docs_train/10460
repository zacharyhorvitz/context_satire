The track appeared in several music critics' year-end lists. Stereogum placed the song at number two on their year-end list, calling the lyrics "genius, the music a propulsive mirage" and the overall effect "overwhelming and tingly". Lindsay Zoladz from The Ringer also placed the song at number two on her list, describing it as "a precise distillation of the ways the internet shapes and warps how we experience life". Zoladz further called it a "great pop song in the spirit" of the Body Talk (2010) era of Robyn and felt "something liberating" about the track's conclusion.
