 Six members of the Newtown Strong team who ran the Boston Marathon on Monday are OK, according to a Facebook post from the group. "Members of the Newtown Strong team which ran in today's marathon are safe. All runners completed the race before the explosions happened," the post said. The runners ran the 26.2-mile event to honor the 26 people who were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14.  Three left dead including an 8-year-old boy and more than 150 people hospitalized after two explosions at the Boston Marathon on Monday. Just minutes before the explosions occurred Former Gov. Mitt Romney’s son Tagg was with his family on the marathon route. This morning he joins “Starting Point” to discuss the attack and its effect on other Bostonians.  Fox has removed from its web site a recent episode of "Family Guy," which showed mass deaths at the Boston Marathon. A doctored version of the clip, which made fun of Monday's terrorist attack at the marathon, has since circulated online. Fox Broadcasting refused to comment. But Seth MacFarlane, creator of the "Family Guy" cartoon, condemned the hoax episode in a Tuesday tweet.
