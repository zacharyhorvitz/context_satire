 To warm up the crowd before President Donald Trump took the stage for a campaign rally in Michigan on Thursday night, his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., laid into the proposed "Green New Deal" as typical of the pie-in-the-sky, price-is-no-concern vision Democrats have for the future of the country. "AOC Sucks! AOC Sucks!" chanted the crowd on cue.  New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said a chant from President Donald Trump's supporters mocking her was emblematic of Trump finding a female politician to attack. "You know this is part of a pattern that the right and the far-right and, frankly, the President is consistent with," Ocasio-Cortez told CNN in New York. "He doesn't have another woman, Hillary Clinton or whoever else, to vilify anymore so they need to find another woman to kind of prop up and become a lightning rod." At a rally in Michigan on Thursday, members of the crowd could be heard chanting "AOC sucks" at the mention of her name by Donald Trump Jr. Carlson concluded his July 9, 2019 Tucker Carlson Tonight episode with a 3-minute monologue about Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN); he criticized Omar for being ungrateful to the United States, where she had been granted asylum, and called her "living proof that the way we practice immigration has become dangerous to this country." His monologue was described by The Guardian as "scathing", "racially loaded", and "full of anti-immigrant rhetoric". Congresswoman Omar responded on Twitter, saying that "advertisers should not be underwriting this kind of dangerous, hateful rhetoric." In their July 10 article on the incident, The Daily Beast commented that, mainly because of "right-wing attacks that have then been amplified by members of Congress and the president", Omar has been receiving death threats since she was elected to Congress.
