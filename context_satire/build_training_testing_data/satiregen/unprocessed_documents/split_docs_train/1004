Main Street is a generic phrase used to denote a primary retail street of a village, town or small city in many parts of the world. It is usually a focal point for shops and retailers in the central business district, and is most often used in reference to retailing and socializing. The term is commonly used in Ireland, Scotland, the United States, Canada, and less often in Australia and New Zealand. In the non-Scottish regions of the United Kingdom, the common description is High Street though "Fore Street" or "Front Street" is commonplace in some parts. The first Great Clips salon opened under the name Super Clips near the University of Minnesota campus on September 22, 1982. Great Clips salons specialized in no-frills, low-priced haircuts and found immediate success with their first three salons, which opened over a span of three months.  Off a main street in Kabul, standing outside a high walled compound is an old Afghan security guard, manning the front gate. Walking towards him is a group of well-dressed students in gray and maroon uniforms -- almost looking out of place in this dusty, garbage-littered, rundown city. Inside are large trees surrounding a deep rose-colored two-storey building, and all you can hear is music. This is the Afghanistan National Institute of Music (ANIM), which has been up and running for the past two and a half years.
