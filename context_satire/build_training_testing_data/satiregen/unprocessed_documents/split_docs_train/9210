 In South Africa, Nelson Mandela's 95th birthday is being marked by celebrations, good deeds, and an exhibition of stunning new posters of the country's former president. Mandela himself will be spending the day in hospital in Pretoria, where he is said to be in a critical but stable condition, battling a lung infection. Since 2009, Mandela's birthday has been designated "Nelson Mandela International Day." The celebration encourages people around the globe to partake in 67 minutes of public service: one minute per year of service that the former statesman, also known as Madiba, has given to his country.  Former South African leader Nelson Mandela still is in critical condition at a Pretoria hospital but "shows sustained improvement," the office of South African President Jacob Zuma said Monday. Mandela, who turned 95 last week, has been hospitalized with a lung ailment since June. Zuma, who visited Mandela in the hospital on Monday, also said last week that Mandela was steadily improving, after weeks of describing his health as critical but stable. Mandela, a Nobel peace laureate, spent 27 years in prison for fighting against oppression of minorities in South Africa.  Thabo Mbeki, who succeeded Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president 14 years ago, says the ailing revered statesmen will pull through. "I know the doctors who are working with him are very good people, very good doctors and I am quite certain, I am quite certain that, one of these days, Madiba will go back home," Mbeki said over the weekend, calling Mandela by his clan name. Mandela, 94, is considered the founding father of South Africa's modern democracy. He has been hospitalized in Pretoria since June 8 for a recurring lung infection -- a legacy of his years of imprisonment under South Africa's now-defunct apartheid regime.
