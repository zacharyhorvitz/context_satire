The Chicago franchise focuses on the professional and private lives of the firefighters, police officers, emergency medical personnel, and legal professionals who serve the city of Chicago. A recurring and unifying theme of the four shows is Molly's, a small bar owned by three firefighters which has been frequented by characters from all four shows. Dick Wolf has stated that most episodes in the franchise will end with a scene at Molly's, saying that "it's a great note on the end of every show that connects all the shows". In "Payback", he and Voight got tip on who the witness was following from Voight's favor to the Ivory Tower, a junkie named Ruben who tried to break into Olinsky's car a while back. He gives Voight the witness's address, and Voight telling him to not get involved. Voight asks Olinsky about his retirement papers being filed. Olinsky then claims he's not retiring; he just wants to use the paperwork as a flare to see if Internal Affairs will make a move. Little is known about Atwater's background. His parents are either absent from his life or deceased and his younger siblings Jordan and Vanessa live with him as his "wards". His colleague Kim Burgess is one of his few colleagues whom they have regular contact with and it is implied that she has babysat Vanessa more than once. Like Joe Cruz from Chicago Fire, Atwater was raised in a gang-controlled neighborhood and had relatives and friends in prison but avoided a life of crime.
