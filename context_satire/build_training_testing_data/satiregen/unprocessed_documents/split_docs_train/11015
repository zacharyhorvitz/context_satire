 If Michael Cohen can show federal prosecutors credible evidence that President Donald Trump knew in advance about the infamous Trump Tower Russia meeting of June 9, 2016 -- as Cohen now reportedly claims -- the President's son could be facing perjury charges. It was Donald Jr. who approved the time, location and participants in a meeting that included a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and a Russian-American lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin. He also brought to the Trump Tower conference table the then-chairman of Trump's campaign, Paul Manafort, and brother-in-law Jared Kushner among others. The President has repeatedly denied being told about the meeting before it happened.  President Donald Trump on Friday denied his former personal attorney Michael Cohen's claim that he knew in advance about a highly controversial 2016 Trump Tower meeting, the latest public breach in the fraying relationship between the President and his former confidant. "(No,) I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr." Trump wrote as part of a series of tweets Friday morning. "Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?)." Sources told CNN that Cohen claims that then-candidate Trump had advance notice of the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower involving Donald Trump Jr. and is willing to assert that claim to special counsel Robert Mueller.  Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley on Monday rejected Democratic calls for the committee to bring Donald Trump Jr. back to testify again about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting following Michael Cohen's claims that Trump Jr. told his father about the meeting in advance. "If he misled the committee, he's lying to Congress. That's a crime," the Iowa Republican told CNN. "And that'd be up to the prosecutors, not me."
