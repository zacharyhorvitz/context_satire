 American allies woke up to Donald Trump's victory early Wednesday deeply unsettled, questioning whether the US will remain a stalwart partner and a stable pillar of the international order. Trump himself promised change and uncertainty in his first major foreign policy address in April, saying he would "shake the rust off America's foreign policy" and that the US would "have to be unpredictable, and we have to be unpredictable starting now." Early Wednesday, in his acceptance speech, he said he wanted to "tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone." French President Francois Hollande delivered an unusually bald response -- at a level of government where concerns are usually cloaked in diplomatic bon mots -- laying bare the risks international counterparts see in the wild card that is the US President-elect.  From the beginning, everyone underestimated Donald Trump. He pulled off a stunning victory after the most unprecedented of presidential campaigns. Trump channeled the fury of average Americans against Washington. He tapped into their anxiety about the present and the fear of the future.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Wednesday even though she "didn't want to see Donald Trump win," the Massachusetts Democrat and "those of us who supported Hillary Clinton will respect this result." In a statement, Warren brought up a focal point of Trump's campaign: his promise to rebuild the economy as an area for collaboration. "President-elect Trump promised to rebuild our economy for working people, and I offer to put aside our differences and work with him on that task," she wrote. "But the integrity of our democracy is more important than any individual election," Sen. Warren said, echoing President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's remarks from earlier today.
