 Robert Mueller is done. After a 22-month investigation, charges against 37 defendants, seven guilty pleas and one conviction at trial, the Justice Department announced Friday that the special counsel's office has wrapped up its probe into Russian election interference, possible Trump campaign collusion with Moscow and obstruction of justice. A senior Justice Department official told CNN there are no more indictments coming from special counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller submitted a confidential report to Attorney General William Barr Friday detailing the decisions his team made to prosecute or not prosecute those who were investigated, Barr said in a letter to lawmakers. The Barr letter is a four-page letter sent on March 24, 2019, from Attorney General William Barr to leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees detailing the purported "principal conclusions" of the Mueller Report of the Special Counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller into Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 United States presidential election, allegations of conspiracy or coordination between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, and allegations of obstruction of justice.  House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said Sunday the committee will call Attorney General William Barr to testify "in the near future." "In light of the very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department following the Special Counsel report, where Mueller did not exonerate the President, we will be calling Attorney General Barr in to testify before @HouseJudiciary in the near future," the New York Democrat tweeted. Barr submitted to Congress on Sunday his summary of the main conclusions from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. In the letter, Barr said Mueller did not find President Donald Trump's campaign or associates conspired with Russia.
