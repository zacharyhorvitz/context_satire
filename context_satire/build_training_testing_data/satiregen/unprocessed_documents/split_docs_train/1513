He meets with Amazon investors for a total of only six hours a year. Instead of using PowerPoints, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives. Starting in 1998, Bezos publishes an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers not competitors, take risks for market leadership, facilitate staff morale, build a company culture, and empower people. Bezos maintains the email address "jeff@amazon.com" as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company. Former employees, current employees, the media, and politicians have criticized Amazon for poor working conditions at the company. In 2011, it was publicized that workers had to carry out tasks in 100 °F (38 °C) heat  at the Breinigsville, Pennsylvania warehouse. As a result of these inhumane conditions, employees became extremely uncomfortable and suffered from dehydration and collapse. Loading-bay doors were not opened to allow in fresh air because of concerns over theft.  From a mid-level engineer to the CEO, Amazon employees are fighting back hard against accusations that the company treats its workers deplorably. CEO Jeff Bezos, in a widely distributed staff memo, rebutted a New York Times Amazon exposé that portrayed the company as a "brutal" place to work. He rebutted the claim that Amazon is a place where managers routinely weed out employees and backstabbing is encouraged. "The article doesn't describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day," Bezos wrote on Sunday.
