 The athletes have arrived, the venues are ready and expectation is palpable as the sporting world awaits the commencement of the 31st Olympic Games, the first ever Olympiad to be staged in South America. Although there is little by the way of sporting action Friday, there's still plenty happening in host city Rio de Janeiro. Here are five things to look out for on day zero of the 2016 Olympic Games. Opening ceremony Rio 2016 will officially get underway Friday when IOC president Thomas Bach opens the Games in the Maracana Stadium.  The Olympic Games began Friday with a cool opening ceremony that included samba, lasers, the country's famous supermodel and plenty of dancing. It was part history lesson, part celebration of culture, part pitch for peace and for the health of the planet. It's just too bad that Pele, the football legend, was too ill to be there. Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima, a former runner who led the marathon at the 2004 Games until he was attacked by a spectator, lit the Olympic cauldron.  Rebirth and regeneration. That was the message behind a vibrant Opening Ceremony that heralded the start of the Rio 2016 Olympics. From supermodel Gisele Bundchen's tribute to the "Girl from Ipanema" to the promise of an athletes' forest to be planted after the Games, Brazil's big night saluted the country's past and pointed towards a greener future. A day of protests against the hosting of the Games gave way to a night of pageantry at the Maracana Stadium, albeit on a budget one-tenth the size of the equivalent in London four years ago.
