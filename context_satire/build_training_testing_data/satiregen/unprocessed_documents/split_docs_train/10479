In the late 1980s, St. James became friendly with Michael Alig, although at first he and the other club personalities shunned the newcomer. Undeterred, Alig soon created his own scene by gathering up other creative personalities of the nightlife world; he used his flamboyant style, and engaged in self-promotion and innovative themed parties. St. James morphed from celebutante to Club Kid while helping Alig create the new scene. Alig and St. James threw many parties together, eventually setting up the Disco 2000 club night at the New York City club The Limelight. After some time Dr. Fowler decided to divide his property and the club had to look for a new home. The members explored the possibilities of the Disbrow Farm located far out in the rural northern end of New Rochelle. It comprised 180 acres of level land, which had been under cultivation for several years. After much discussion, the Pelham Country Club made the move to what would then be called the 'Wykagyl Golf Club'. In 1900, Dr. Charles Ripley Gillett and his brother bought clubs and balls, planted cans in the ground of a cow pasture and proceeded to teach themselves the game of golf, which had recently had been introduced into the United States from Scotland. Soon after, the first Pelham Country Club was formed. This club laid out a nine-hole course on the rolling meadows known as the 'Carson Place'. Dr. Edward P. Fowler of New York City bought the Carson place as a summer home.
