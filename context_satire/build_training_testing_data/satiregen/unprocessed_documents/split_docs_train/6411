 Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, are tearing up long-standing rules of engagement with the media as they try to bypass "frequent misreporting" by royal correspondents and tell their stories to handpicked outlets and directly to the public. In a statement accompanying the shock announcement late Wednesday that they would be stepping back from their duties as senior royals, the couple wrote that they will no longer participate in the Royal Rota system, the pool of British journalists that for decades has covered all royal events and shares information and photos with other media. Removing themselves from the pool would limit their engagement with what has become one of their biggest headaches â€” the British tabloids. But the move could backfire, especially as the extraordinary break with the Royal Family is only likely to spark even greater interest. Harvard has several fight songs, the most played of which, especially at football, are "Ten Thousand Men of Harvard" and "Harvardiana." While "Fair Harvard" is actually the alma mater, "Ten Thousand Men" is better known outside the university. The Harvard University Band performs these fight songs and other cheers at football and hockey games. These were parodied by Harvard alumnus Tom Lehrer in his song "Fight Fiercely, Harvard," which he composed while an undergraduate.  Our solar system resides in one of the Milky Way galaxy's spiral arms, and for the first time, astronomers have realized we're close to a giant wave-shaped gaseous structure that connects star nurseries. This wave -- now known as the "Radcliffe Wave" for the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study -- extends in crests that are 500 light-years both above and below the middle of our galaxy's disk. The long structure stretches for 9,000 light-years total and measure 400 light-years wide. It's the largest of its kind in our galaxy.
