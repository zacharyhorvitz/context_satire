Dawn and Mack make a pact to see a movie together. When a cool student Derek Moses tells them it's uncool to see a movie with parents, Dawn lies to Mack that she's sick. The quads convince their parents to go to another movie complex where their friends can't see them. Surprisingly, they find most of their friends, including Mack, at that complex. Cayey was founded on August 17, 1773, by Juan Mata VÃ¡zquez, who became its first mayor. It is said that Cayey derives its name from the Taino Indian word for "a place of waters". Its original name was "Cayey de Muesas" in honor of Miguel de Muesas, the then governor of Puerto Rico. The town is located in a valley nestled between Puerto Rico's Cordillera Central mountain range and the Sierra de Cayey at roughly the midpoint of routes PR-1 and PR-52. After being called too young by Josie and her friend, the quads try to prove them wrong by watching a zombie movie called Field of Brains; however, Tom and Anne tell the quads that the movie is too scary for them, but they ignore them. After watching the movie, they become very frightened and begin seeing symptoms that Tom and Anne are becoming zombies. Later, they brew up a cure and put it in Tom and Anne's shoes. Later, they learn that there are rational explanations for all the things they saw and later impress Josie and her friend by talking about the movie.
