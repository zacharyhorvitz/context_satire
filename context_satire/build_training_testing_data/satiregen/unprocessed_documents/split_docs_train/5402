The parent company of Long John Silver's and A&W, Yorkshire was acquired by Tricon Global and Tricon was renamed to Yum! Brands, Inc in 2002, but by January 2011, Yum! announced it was looking for a buyer for its Long John Silver's and A&W All-American Restaurants divisions, citing poor sales and a desire to transfer more of its focus to international expansion. Yum! was created on May 30, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo's fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies. Several years before changing its name to "Yum! Brands", Tricon Global was spun off in late 1997. Until early 2007, Pizza Hut's main advertising slogan was "Gather 'round the good stuff", and was "Now You're Eating!" from 2008 to 2009. From 2009 to 2012, the advertising slogan was "Your Favorites. Your Pizza Hut" From 2012 to 2016, the advertising slogan was "Make it great", a variation of the 1980sâ€“1995 slogan "Makin' it great!".
