 Republicans may be jubilant that revamped health care legislation finally passed the House on Thursday, but many of the professional associations that represent America's health care workers are clearly unhappy. The groups said they were "disappointed," "deeply disappointed" and "extremely disappointed" with legislation that is "unacceptable," "shameful," "harmful and irresponsible." Their reactions immediately followed the 217-213 House vote. The American Medical Association said in a statement that although change is needed in the health care system, people with pre-existing health conditions "face the possibility of going back to the time when insurers could charge them premiums that made access to coverage out of the question."  The fight to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is just getting started. President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan deserve significant credit for getting their alternative, the American Health Care Act, or AHCA, across the finish line. But the version of health reform that the Senate will send back in the coming weeks or months will likely look very different from the legislation the House passed Thursday. And that's a good thing.  In many ways, the health care industry has been a great friend to the U.S. economy. Its plentiful jobs helped lift the country out of the Great Recession and, partly due to the Affordable Care Act, it now employs one in nine Americans — up from one in 12 in 2000. As President Donald Trump seeks to fulfill his campaign pledge to create millions more jobs, the industry would seem a promising place to turn. But the business mogul also campaigned to repeal Obamacare and lower health care costs — a potentially serious job killer.
