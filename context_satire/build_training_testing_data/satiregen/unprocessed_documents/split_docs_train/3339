Last Christmas is a 2019 romantic comedy film directed by Paul Feig and written by Bryony Kimmings and Emma Thompson, who co-wrote the story with her husband, Greg Wise. Based on the song of the same name, and inspired by the music of George Michael, the film stars Emilia Clarke as a disillusioned Christmas store worker who forms a relationship with a mysterious man (Henry Golding) and begins to fall for him; Thompson and Michelle Yeoh also star. At a convenience store called Handy Quick, Cat shows Sam an ATM which gives away "free" money whenever a special code is entered. Cat takes advantage of the ATM's quirk, getting money from it regularly, not realizing it is wrong. Even Sam warns her of the consequences, but the girls use the money to buy stuff anyway. Yokvish, the store's clerk, eventually catches Cat in the act of emptying the ATM, and informs an approaching policeman who arrests Cat on the spot.
