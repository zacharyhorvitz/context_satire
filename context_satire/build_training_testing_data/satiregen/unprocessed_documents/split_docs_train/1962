 Democratic presidential candidates are vying to be seen as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's ally -- even if they don't ultimately win her endorsement. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren showcased her alliance with the freshman lawmaker from the Bronx on Thursday. The two penned a five-page letter -- and released a three-minute video explaining it -- pressing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over his work on Sears' board while his roommate from Yale gutted the department-store giant on its way to bankruptcy. Still six years short of the Constitution's minimum age requirement to be president herself, Ocasio-Cortez's massive social media following and ability to generate news headlines has made her a key player in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.  Joe Biden is set to shift into a new -- and riskier -- phase of his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. After entering the race three weeks ago as a stronger-than-expected front-runner, the former vice president is set to deliver a speech at his first major rally of the race Saturday in Philadelphia. Then, Biden and his aides have said, he'll begin rolling out policy proposals. And, he said, he will soon likely begin preparing for the Democratic presidential debates. As Washington does not have gubernatorial term limits, incumbent Democratic Governor Jay Inslee is eligible to run for re-election to a third term. Inslee initially declined the opportunity, choosing instead to launch a campaign for President of the United States in the 2020 election. However, he dropped out of that race in August 2019 and announced he would indeed seek a third term. Several other Democratic political figures had publicly considered campaigns themselves in the case that Inslee did not run but currently no Democrats are challenging him.
