Darfur ( dar-FOOR; Arabic: دار فور‎, romanized: Dār Fūr, lit. 'Realm of the Fur') is a region in western Sudan. Dār is an Arabic word meaning "home " – the region was named Dardaju (Arabic: دار داجو‎, romanized: Dār Dājū) while ruled by the Daju, who migrated from Meroë c. 350 AD, and it was then renamed Dartunjur (Arabic: دار تنجر‎, romanized: Dār Tunjur) when the Tunjur ruled the area. Darfur was an independent sultanate for several hundred years, incorporated into Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1916.
