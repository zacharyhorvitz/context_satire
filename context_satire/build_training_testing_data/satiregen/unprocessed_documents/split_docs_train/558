Qiao Feng is the charismatic chief of the Beggars' Sect who possesses strong leadership qualities and is perhaps the strongest/ most willed character in this novel. His internal energy is among the best (if not the best) and possesses the original "18 dragon subduing palms" which is considered the strongest version before refining it into a more orthodox version and ordering Xu Zhu to pass it on to the next leader so it wouldn't bring extreme chaos to the wulin world(he knows how powerful it can be and ultimately he realizes that sometimes he is also the victim of the skill because all the chaos it adds to the problems he already had) towards the end of the novel. Guo Jing possessed the refined version but was missing several alternate palm stances that were removed by Qiao. But still even that version was considered the most powerful skill for the next generations(proved by Guo Jing when he beat everyone in his prime day using it). Wang Feng was born in Beijing to a musician's family. Under his father's command, Wang started practicing violin when he was five years old. He attended the middle school attached to the Central Conservatory of Music at the age of eleven. Wang did not understand the purpose of playing violin, or why he had to stay home practising while other kids of his age could play outside.  The bodies of 18 children have been found after a landslide buried elementary school students and a villager in southwest China, state media said Friday. Rescuers found the bodies as they scoured through rubble at a village after the landslide struck the school and two houses in Yunnan province, state broadcaster CCTV reported. One person is still missing, CCTV reported. The students were studying Thursday during a public holiday to make up for classes disrupted by recent earthquakes.
