 Paul Ryan may have just ascended to House speaker -- but that essentially ends his hopes of ever being in the White House, says his predecessor, John Boehner. "I'm not sure," Boehner said when asked about Ryan's future White House chances by CNN's Dana Bash. "I think he would've liked to have been president, but I think he's figured out God had another plan for him to be speaker of the House." The now-former speaker also said he isn't planning a presidential run of his own.  Conservatives in the House are saying not so fast to the idea of Speaker Paul Ryan. On Tuesday night, the Wisconsin Republican laid out his vision to his GOP colleagues and said he would be willing to serve as speaker -- if the whole conference could unite behind him. But Wednesday morning, many of the conservatives that consistently fought outgoing House Speaker John Boehner and helped scuttle the bid to replace him by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy signaled they aren't ready to jump on the bandwagon for Ryan.

Rep. Paul Ryan told House Republicans on Tuesday he is willing to serve as speaker and will make a decision within the week -- but only if his conditions are met. Ryan laid out his guidelines in a closed-door session with the full House GOP conference after weeks of lobbying from senior members of his party for him to take on the difficult task of leading the divided conference -- a job Ryan repeatedly said he has never wanted. "I came to the conclusion that this is a very dire moment -- not just for Congress, not just for the Republican Party, but for our country. And I think our country is in desperate need of leadership," Ryan told reporters after addressing his colleagues.
