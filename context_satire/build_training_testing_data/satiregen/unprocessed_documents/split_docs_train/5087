 President Donald Trump received cheers and boos from a World Series crowd Sunday night as he was displayed on Nationals Park's video screen. The chilly reception, which came during a ballpark-wide salute to US service members, wasn't particularly surprising in predominantly liberal Washington, DC -- and at a time when Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry -- though it came on the same day that the President announced the US killed ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the world's most wanted terrorist. The President and first lady Melania Trump were sitting in a suite behind home plate at Nationals Park, joined by some Republican members of Congress, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, and Reps. Steve Scalise and Matt Gaetz, when they were shown on the big screen in right field during a salute to veterans. As a shot of US troops came on the screen during the Nationals' "Wave Your Caps" mid-inning segment, the stadium erupted in cheers before a shot of Trump appeared.  Democratic Sen. Chris Coons on Monday shunned chants of "lock him up" aimed at President Donald Trump by the crowd at World Series Game 5. "I have a hard time with the idea of a crowd on a globally televised sporting event chanting 'lock him up' about our President. I frankly think the office of the President deserves respect, even when the actions of our President at times don't," Coons told CNN's John Berman on "New Day." He continued: "I certainly hope that we won't hear 'lock him up' chants at Democratic rallies or at our convention.  President Donald Trump is a big sports fan. So it makes sense that he's planning to attend game five of the World Series on Sunday in Washington -- assuming the Nationals don't sweep the Houston Astros in four games the night before. But Trump won't be following in the footsteps of the last Republican president in throwing out the first pitch at a World Series game. Instead, he'll be sitting in the stands while one of his most prominent critics toes the rubber.
