Noah's perspective: Four months after the summer's end Noah and Helen are progressing through therapy and dealing with family life. Martin is struggling in his public school and wants to go to private school, which Noah cannot afford. Whitney is accused of having an eating disorder when Helen overhears her vomiting in the bathroom. In therapy, Helen is still struggling with the difficulties and distrust Noah's actions have caused and is reluctant to let Noah attend the Literary Festival event in Montauk where her father, Bruce (John Doman), is to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award as she needs to stay home for her burgeoning small store business, and  be there for Whitney. At the school, Noah brings up Anton at a faculty meeting calling him "brilliant" but expresses concerns about him and his home life. Noah later learns that Anton is the son of the principal, Janelle Wilson. Noah later apologizes to Janelle about the comments he made. In the classroom, Noah and the students discuss their next assignment: reading The Waste Land. Their son's death was not the last tragedy for Rick and Joanne. Both were especially hard-hit by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as Joanne's brother and Rick's closest friend, Billy Minardi, was working as a bond trader for Cantor Fitzgerald on the 105th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center when it was struck by American Airlines Flight 11. Since 2002, the University of Louisville has designated a December home game as the Billy Minardi Classic, and the university named a dorm on campus as "Billy Minardi Hall." Only a few months earlier, another brother-in-law of Rick, Don Vogt, was killed after being hit by a New York City cab.
