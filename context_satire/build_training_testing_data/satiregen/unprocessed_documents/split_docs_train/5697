It was first rumoured that Walsh was about to make a record deal with her band's record label, Fascination Records, although nothing has been confirmed. Soon after the rumour, Walsh confirmed on Suck My Pop, a programme that she co-hosts on the television channel Viva in the United Kingdom, that she will feature on English rapper Aggro Santos' upcoming single, "Like U Like". The track will be her first step away from Girls Aloud as a singer. Walsh was asked for OK! This inspires Linda to come to the conclusion that the reason she wanted Annie was so she could do at least one thing right and be a mother to her as she had fouled up her own life so many times. Days later, Susan calls Linda's mother to let her know of Linda's progress. This ends in failure as Linda's mother gives Susan the funeral home number. Linda then laments sadly on how she has tried to find some sort of forgiveness for all the bad choices she has made throughout her life and how she couldn't believe it when Susan told her that she was disowned by her parents and that they can live their lives without knowing their own daughter or even their own grandson while Susan herself is such a good person and mother. On the way to have a smoke, Linda collapses in the hallway and is immediately rushed to the hospital. On the way to the emergency room, Linda informs the doctors that she probably won't live through the ordeal and that when it's time for her to go let her go. Susan visits her and Linda vows to go to school and make something of herself like Susan did if she makes it but voices that she won't live to do so. Susan expresses hope that Linda does pull through as she has a lot to give.
