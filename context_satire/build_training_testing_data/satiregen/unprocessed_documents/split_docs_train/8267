Tripper is the debut album by the Danish group Efterklang. The name of the album according to member Thomas Humser refers to two things. One meaning is that "tripper" is the slang term for a traveler. It is also a Danish meaning for shuffling one's feet in anticipation of something good to happen. In 1731, royal cabinet secretary Georg Christian Jacobi acquired a piece of land from princess Sophia Hedwig on the coast north of Copenhagen and constructed a small country retreat at the site for his own use. The name Enrum is first recorded in 1733. In 1745, Jacobi sold the house to Michael Fabritius, a co-founder of the Danish Asia Company as well as Kurantbanken. After his death in 1845, his wife, Anna Maria de Longueville, increased the size of the estate through acquisition of new land. Enrum was in 1845 acquired by Count Christian Conrad Sophus Danneskiold-Samsøe, who also owned the Holmegård Estate at Næstved. He commissioned Johan Daniel Herholdt  to design a new house which was completed in 1864. Count Danneskiold-Samsøe spent his summers on the estate where the Danish Royal Family and the Russian tsar family were among his guests.
