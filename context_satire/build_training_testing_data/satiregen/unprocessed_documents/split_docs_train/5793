The nature of the contest fractured in the next few days. Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates, and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson, were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign. Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans. She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary, setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two FebruaryÂ 5 Super Tuesday states. The impact of Super Tuesday was lessened by Mitt Romney's convincing victories preceding Super Tuesday. Frontrunner Romney was able to increase his lead significantly, with wins in six states and winning over half the delegates at stake. However, Santorum's three wins, and a near-win in Ohio, allowed him to carry on as a candidate for another month.  Hillary Clinton saw Bernie Sanders' New Hampshire blowout and raised him one in South Carolina. Riding the strength of her support among African-Americans to a resounding victory in the Palmetto State, Clinton seized the momentum in the Democratic presidential race -- winning her third of four early-state contests just three days before the race goes national on Super Tuesday. Here are five takeaways from South Carolina's Democratic primary:  Clinton's going national It was a bumpy ride through the early states -- but Clinton's firewall of minority support held, helping her seal a close contest in Nevada and then turn South Carolina into her first dominant win of the 2016 race. Headed into Super Tuesday, the confidence Clinton's campaign had after October and November is back.
