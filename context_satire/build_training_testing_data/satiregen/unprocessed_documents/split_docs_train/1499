 Mexico's foreign minister on Tuesday added his voice to the chorus condemning the Trump administration's separation of children from their parents at the southern US border, calling the policy "cruel and inhumane." Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray referred to one case involving a 10-year-old girl with Down syndrome as "particularly painful." He said the girl and her brother were sent to a US facility in McAllen, Texas, while her mother went to one an hour away in Brownsville. The Mexican consulate in McAllen is working to get the girl released so she can be united with her father, the foreign minster said.  A 10-year-old Mexican girl with Down syndrome is among the thousands of children who have recently been separated from their parents at the southern US border, Mexico's foreign minister said. The girl and her brother were sent to a detention center in McAllen,Texas, and their mother was sent to a facility about an hour away in Brownsville after the family attempted to cross the border. Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said the Mexican consulate along with the girl's father, a legal US resident, are working to get the girl released. It's a "particularly painful case," Videgaray said.  Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan wouldn't say President Donald Trump's "zero tolerance" policy for illegal border crossings, which has led to children being separated from their parents, is humane Tuesday, saying only, "I think it's the law." When asked the question by CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room" Tuesday, Homan wouldn't say yes. "I think, I think it's the law," Homan said after a pause. When pressed, Homan hesitated and said, "I think it's the law and I'm in law enforcement and I must follow the law."
