 Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States on Friday, vowing to drain power from Washington elites and always put "America first" in its dealings with the world at a moment of transformative political change. He arrived at the White House for the first time as President just before 5 p.m. ET following a day of tradition marking the power shift in the nation's capital. In a time-honored ceremony on the flag-draped West Front of the Capitol earlier in the afternoon, Trump placed his left hand on a family Bible and another that belonged to Abraham Lincoln and promised to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.  President Donald Trump promised a new era guided by one principle -- "only America first" -- moments after being sworn in as the nation's 45th commander-in-chief. But Friday's transfer of power from President Barack Obama's Democratic administration to Trump's nationalist Republican presidency featured many more symbolic moments from the former and new presidents and their families. Here are memorable moments from Inauguration Day: Trump takes the oath of office At noon Friday, Trump placed his left hand on two Bibles -- one used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861 and one a gift from his mother when Trump graduated Sunday School in 1955 -- and pledged to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. With that, the nation had its 45th President.  It was not the Inauguration Day that Hillary Clinton imagined. When the skies finally opened up on Friday and rain began to fall over the US Capitol, Clinton's turn to stand before the thousands gathered on the Mall and take the oath of office as the 45th president never came. Instead, she remained seated with her husband, Bill Clinton, by her side. And she watched a man whom she believes is fundamentally unfit to hold the highest office of the land get sworn in as her next president.
