Dodge Brothers cars continued to rank second place in American sales in 1920. However, the same year, tragedy struck as John Dodge was felled by pneumonia in January. His brother Horace then died of cirrhosis in December of the same year (reportedly out of grief at the loss of his brother, to whom he was very close). With the loss of both founders, the Dodge Brothers Company passed into the hands of the brothers' widows, who promoted long-time employee Frederick Haynes to the company presidency.  A 27-year-old man pleaded guilty on Monday to assaulting a member of Congress for throwing water on Republican Rep. Steve King at an Iowa restaurant in March, according to the Justice Department. Blake Gibbins of Lafayette, Colorado, "admitted that on March 22, 2019, at the Mineral City Mill & Grill in Fort Dodge, Iowa, he approached a table where U.S. Congressman Steve King and others were seated and assaulted Congressman King by intentionally throwing a cup of water on him," the department wrote in a statement Monday. Gibbins made the admissions at his guilty plea hearing and in a plea agreement, according to the statement. In 1992, Dodge moved their performance orientation forward substantially with the Viper, which featured an aluminum V10 engine and composite sports roadster body. This was the first step in what was marketed as "The New Dodge", which was an aggressive advertising campaign with a litany of new models, with television ads narrated by Edward Herrmann that pointed out the innovations in the vehicles and challenged their competitors. Also,he would go on to serve as the brand's spokesperson for the rest of the decade.
