The series was cancelled in May 2011, and the conversation between Halpern and his father, in which the news is shared, was published on Halpern's Tumblr page. In his response to his son's revelation, Samuel Halpern stated that he liked the television series: "Well, I liked it . It was kind of shitty at first, but I thought it got a lot better. You know what show I like? The television show based on Halpern's debut book was called $#*! My Dad Says (pronounced "Bleep My Dad Says") with William Shatner in the title role as the colorful curmudgeon. The pilot, written by Halpern and Schumacker, was filmed in March 2010, CBS picked it up in May, and the show premiered on September 23, 2010. Halpern explained the series as "the dichotomy of this older guy who says whatever he wants and this younger guy who is tiptoeing through life," with the latter careful not to offend anyone for fear of losing jobs or friends. By 2009, Halpern was a full-time writer for Maxim magazine's online publication. Halpern returned to San Diego to live with his girlfriend of three years, but the relationship ended following the move and Halpern then moved back to the family home.
