Gibb met Scottish pop singer Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, tell him to stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never expected much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite the wrong way to describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". Gibb said he had "battled the booze" since the 1970s. John Lennon introduced him to his favourite drink, scotch and coke:  "If he had given me cyanide, I would have drunk the cyanide, I was so in awe of the man." With his neighbour Ringo Starr he would go out drinking. It got to the point where he became unreliable and prior to going onstage would have to feel his way along the wall to get there, according to Barry. Gibb recalled the first meeting with Lulu's parents, his future-in-laws, "I went up to Glasgow to meet Lu's parents, and I was told that Billy, who is younger than Lu, would be at the station to meet me. I got off the train and was walking along the platform when I saw him. I didn't need to speak, I knew it was Billy and I went up to him and said, 'You're Billy, aren't you? ', he said, 'You must be Maurice' and we had met".
