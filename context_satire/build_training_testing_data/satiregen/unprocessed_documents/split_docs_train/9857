Beginning in 1920, a team of farm boys, including Ray Weishaar, who became known as the "hog boys", consistently won races. The group had a live hog as their mascot. Following a win, they would put the hog on their Harley and take a victory lap. In 1983, the Motor Company formed a club for owners of its product, taking advantage of the long-standing nickname by turning "hog" into the acronym HOG, for Harley Owners Group. Harley-Davidson introduced the FLD Dyna Switchback in 2012. Designed to be reminiscent of the late 1950s Duo Glide models, the Switchback is the first Dyna platform motorcycle from Harley-Davidson to use an FL front end, and is marketed as a convertible model, with removable saddlebags and windscreen allowing the user to easily convert the bike for touring use. In 1993 the faired and bagged FXRT Sport Glide was discontinued and the FXRS Low Rider was displaced by the FXDL Dyna Low Rider, although the FXR, FXLR, FXRS-Conv Convertible and the FXRS-SP Low Rider Sport continued to be sold. The FXDWG Dyna Wide Glide was introduced in the same year. The Low Rider Sport was discontinued in 1994, and the Low Rider was discontinued after the 2009 model year.
