Late in November, Bull Hump, Dull Knife's son, borrowed a horse from Tangle Hair and left to see relatives who were living with the Sioux. The Army withdrew privileges and confined the Cheyenne to the barracks. The US Indian agent tried to negotiate with the Cheyenne about returning to the south, but they said they would rather die than return. While the US representatives did not accept the strength of the Cheyenne attitude then, later they realized its truth. Under the influence of the medicine man White Bull (also called Ice) and Grey Beard (also called Dark), the Cheyenne went into battle believing that strong spiritual medicine would prevent the soldiers' guns from firing. They were told that if they dipped their hands in a nearby spring, they had only to raise their hands to repel army bullets. Hands raised, the Cheyenne surrounded the advancing troops as they advanced near the Solomon River. Sumner ordered a cavalry charge and the troops charged with drawn sabers; the Cheyenne fled. The department began in 1906 as the Las Vegas Volunteer Fire Department. As the city expanded, so did the demands for a full-time department. In August 1942, the department added its first full-time employees, a chief and 12 firefighters. In 1999 a city ordinance changed the name of the department from Las Vegas Fire Department to Las Vegas Fire & Rescue Department.
