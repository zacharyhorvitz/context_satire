 Deval Patrick raised $2.2 million in the final six weeks of the fourth quarter, his campaign tells CNN, as the former Massachusetts governor mounts a longshot presidential campaign. It's a decent haul for a nascent campaign and the money will allow the governor to air an ad touting his candidacy on CNN in New Hampshire during Tuesday night's CNN debate, for which Patrick did not qualify. That haul comes as a super PAC is slated to spend at least $2 million on ads supporting Patrick in New Hampshire, a state central to his strategy. Patrick enters the new year with $1 million in the bank, according to his campaign, and is set to headline a host of top dollar fundraiser to add to that, including an event hosted by Marty Nesbitt, an American businessman and Barack Obama's 2008 campaign treasurer. In 2005, Patrick announced his candidacy for governor of Massachusetts. He was at first seen as a dark horse candidate, facing veteran politicians Thomas Reilly and Chris Gabrielli in the Democratic primary. Patrick secured the nomination in the September primary, winning 49% of the vote in the three-way race. In the general election, Patrick faced Republican Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey and Independent Massachusetts Turnpike Commission member Christy Mihos.  The New York Times editorial board on Sunday endorsed Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, a potentially meaningful boost for the two female senators left in the race with less than a month before the Iowa caucuses. "Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren right now are the Democrats best equipped to lead that debate," the editorial board wrote. "May the best woman win."
