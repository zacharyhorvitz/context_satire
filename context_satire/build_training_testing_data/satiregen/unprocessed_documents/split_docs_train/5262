Morrison in 1831 issued The Herald of Astrology, subsequently known as Zadkiel's Almanac. In this annual pamphlet, he published predictions of the chief events of the coming year. Morrison wrote with the signature Zadkiel Tao-Sze. Morrison wrote such articles as The New Principia, or true system of astronomy, in which the Earth is proved to be the stationary centre of the Solar System (1868) which made him a charlatan in the eyes of scientists. Morrison was the son of Richard Caleb Morrison who joined the Royal Navy in 1806 serving as a first class volunteer until 1810, master's mate until 1815 and resigned due to ill-health with the rank of lieutenant in 1829. He then devoted himself to the study of astrology which he termed as astro-meteorology. He became a member of the Meteorological Society's Council in 1840. In the middle of 2005, Korey Cooper took a break from performing, due to her pregnancy with their second child. Her rhythm guitar and keyboard roles were temporarily filled by two people: Andrea Winchell (who would later become the Coopers' nanny) on keys and Chris Marvin (lead singer/guitar of The Spark) on guitar.
