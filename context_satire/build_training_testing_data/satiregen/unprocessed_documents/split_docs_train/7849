Daisy and Lulu return from a shopping trip that they took to New Orleans. At the airport, Lulu accidentally picks up a suitcase that is identical to her suitcase, and it turns out to have a stolen $250,000 diamond necklace in it. When the thieves and their boss, Mr. Lipton (Robert Phalen), learn that Lulu and Daisy have the suitcase, they begin pursuing Lulu and Daisy, bent on using whatever means necessary to get the necklace back. Boss Hogg wants the necklace so that he can sell it to his crooked cousin, Big Dan Hogg (Marty Zagon), for $25,000—not realizing how much the necklace is really worth. The Duke family lives in Hazzard County, Georgia. Their patriarch is Jesse Duke, a farmer and former moonshiner who's very wise, and probably the most trusted person in six counties; his nephews, Bo and Luke, and his niece, Daisy, live on the Duke farm with him. Jesse raised Bo, Luke, and Daisy after their parents died in an auto accident. The Duke family had been making moonshine for generations. Boss Hogg is running a crooked casino in Hazzard County. When the state starts a gambling probe, Boss decides to cover for himself by framing the Dukes for possession of gambling devices. Just as he is about to celebrate his success, Boss accidentally sits on a syringe filled with truth serum—which Rosco collected along with other police gadgetry while away at a police convention in Atlanta—and inadvertently injects himself with it. The serum causes Boss to cross his partners by talking too much about the casino, and they will stop at nothing to silence him.
