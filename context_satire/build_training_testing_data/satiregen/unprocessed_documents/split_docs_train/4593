By January 2001, the band had acquired producer Chuck Dennie from By the Tree, and had recorded their first full-length independent album called Not What You Think. After that point they recruited another friend, bassist Travis Lawrence. In 2002, Ryan and Jenny were married, and moved to Dallas to work as full-time musicians. The band later changed its name to "Addison Road," after their sound technician's daughter named Addison. However, Andrew Greer of Christianity Today gave it three stars criticizing that "the lyrics are middle-of-the-road" material, however believing that the band "possesses enough musical range, including Jenny Simmons' formidable vocals, to distinguish themselves from the rest of the pop/rock crowd." At Christian Broadcasting Network, Jennifer E. Jones gave it three out of five noting that "This album isn’t ground-breaking, but for what it's worth, you'll find a song or two that will make you smile." Nathaniel Schexnayder gave it three stars writing that it was and improvement over their first offering calling it "more seasoned" but believing that it is easy to "notice the group’s contemporary slide, and write off the album as an unoriginal, unchallenging pop project." In addition, Schexnayder stating that "In truth though, Stories is a release that is easy to listen to and just a little bit too easy to forget", and this is why the album was "for those who are seeking a fun, but simple, encouraging, pop/rock album."
