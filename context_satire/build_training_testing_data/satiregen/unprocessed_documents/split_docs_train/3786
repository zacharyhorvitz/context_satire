In the summer of 2016, news broke that Breneman would be transferring to the University of Massachusetts for his final two years of eligibility. During the 2016 and 2017 seasons, Breneman led the country in receiving by a tight end and was named an All-American. In order to avoid spending a lot of time on mixing, the band and their production team devoted a week to experimenting with different sound setups until they found the perfect arrangement. The effort proved to be wasted, as the engineering team would end up spending more than two extremely stressful months searching for the right mix, and were only finished after that length of time because the deadline had arrived, not because they felt at all satisfied with the results. Breneman was named a John Mackey Award semi-finalist, the New England Player of the Year and a Campus Insiders All-American, among other awards. After contemplating declaring for the NFL Draft following his junior season, Breneman decided to stay in school for his final season.
