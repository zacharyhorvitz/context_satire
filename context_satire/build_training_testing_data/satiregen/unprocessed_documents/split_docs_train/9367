 Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló argued Saturday that residents of the US territory are treated like "second-class citizens" and said "we need to solve the century-old problem of colonialism in Puerto Rico." In addition to calling for more resources to help rebuild after Hurricane Maria, the governor told CNN's S.E. Cupp, "there's another thing we need: We need to solve the century-old problem of colonialism in Puerto Rico.  Progressive Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Sunday that many of the victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico blame government failure for the deaths of nearly 3,000 people on the island in the aftermath of the storm. "What we saw in Puerto Rico was a mass death of 3,000 people," Ocasio-Cortez said on CNN's "State of the Union." "It was the worst humanitarian crisis in modern American history, and many, many people impacted by this storm point to government inaction as the cause of death." The New York Democrat, who has said her grandfather was among those who went uncounted as fatalities due to the hurricane, said Sunday that government failure during the storm was part of a larger, "systemic issue."  One year after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico -- and one week after President Donald Trump denied the storm's death toll of nearly 3,000 -- the Trump administration is sending a delegation of senior administration officials to the island. Led by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, a cadre of 20 administration officials are meeting with Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló and other local officials "to discuss ongoing recovery efforts as we continue building a stronger, more resilient Puerto Rico," deputy White House press secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement. The group will visit the Joint Recovery Office in Guaynabo, where they will meet and thank federal personnel supporting Puerto Rico's recovery.
