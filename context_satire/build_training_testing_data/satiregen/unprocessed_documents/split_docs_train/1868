Cracker is an American crime drama series produced by Granada Entertainment based upon the British television crime drama of the same name created by Jimmy McGovern. That series ran on ABC from September 18, 1997, until January 24, 1998. An "innovative but disturbing" take on the standard police-detective genre, the Americanized Cracker consists of sixteen one-hour episodes set in Los Angeles. It stars Robert Pastorelli as criminal psychologist Gerry 'Fitz' Fitzgerald and a young Josh Hartnett. Crackers is a studio/compilation album by the British rock band Slade. It was released on 18 November 1985 and reached No. 34 in the UK charts. It was certified Gold by the BPI that same month. Georgia Cracker refers to the original American pioneer settlers of the Province of Georgia (later, the State of Georgia), and their descendants. In the late 19th century and the early part of the 20th century, Georgia ranchers came to be known as "Georgia Crackers" by Floridians when they drove their cattle down into the grassy flatlands of Central Florida to graze in the winter, stopping where the citrus groves began. In order to get the cattle's attention they became very adept at cracking a bullwhip. The term "cracker" was in use during Elizabethan times to describe braggarts.
