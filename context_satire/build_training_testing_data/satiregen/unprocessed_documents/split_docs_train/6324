 Amazon's go-it-alone delivery strategy has driven away one of its biggest partners. FedEx will end its ground delivery contract with Amazon. For years, Amazon has used FedEx's ground delivery service to help shuttle online orders to consumers. But Amazon is also rapidly bolstering its own delivery network, agitating established logistics businesses.  Amazon has grand plans to deliver packages to its customers via autonomous drones but first it needs to get clearance. The company has requested that federal regulators excuse it from following some current rules of flight, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The agency on Thursday published in the Federal Register a petition from Amazon that would allow the company to operate "a delivery system that will get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using UAS" â€” an acronym for unmanned aerial systems, better known as drones. Amazon is requesting permission to use its custom MK27 drone for deliveries before the FAA grants the aircraft a certificate of airworthiness, and an exemption from drone-specific rules, including a requirement that they only be operated when an operator can see it. For $6, Amazon Prime members can have box of "pantries" delivered to their homes. As people shop, Amazon quantifies the space each item takes up so that people can assess the number of boxes needed before check off and shipping.
