Born on 16 April 1953, in Wahroonga, Sydney, Garrett attended Gordon West Public School and then Barker College in Hornsby before studying politics at the Australian National University (ANU), where he was a resident at Burgmann College, and later law at the University of New South Wales. His father died while he was still at school. His mother died in a fire at the family home, during his period at university. About the same time he became a singer with the Australian rock band Midnight Oil in 1973, after responding to an advertisement placed by one of the band's founding members, Rob Hirst. The South Side is an area of the city of Chicago. It is the largest of the three Sides of the city that radiate from downtownâ€”the others being the North Side and the West Side. (While there is no East Side, because Lake Michigan runs along the city's eastern border, there is an East Side community area on the South Side, in the far southeastern section of the city.) The South Side is sometimes referred to as South Chicago, although that name can also refer to a specific community area on the South Side. A friend of the working man, he made his living as printer through the newsrooms of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution over the years. He won Mayor in 1899 and won again when he was eligible in 1904, but the next time he was eligible things didn't go so smoothly. Following the Atlanta race riot of 1906. he won the 1908 Democratic primary (in a virtually one party state) but was arrested for public intoxication less than a month before the December general election and was defeated by Robert Maddox. He served his third and fourth terms following Courtland Winn.
