In the show, Will cheats death, but is left with total amnesia of his life before – and Massey discussed the challenges of playing a character who does not know his own past or family: "It was almost like starting with a blank canvas again. Amnesia’s often associated with some pretty drastic personality changes, so it was a chance to completely recreate Will’s personality in some sense… and yet I also tried to stay faithful to the kind of things that might be hardwired into his body.” In the storyline, amnesiac Will is shocked to learn that he cheated on his husband, and hates thinking he is the type of person who would do that. Wanting to understand, he seeks out Paul to find out how it happened... and finds himself "super attracted" to the athletic young man. Amnesiac Will really likes that Paul accepts him as he is, without expectations of who he was before, and he spontaneously kisses Paul on two occasions. Chandler Massey spoke about the story's impact in a speech to the Human Rights Campaign Atlanta Gala of May 2018: "We received letters from young men and old men  all across the world that said they saw something of themselves in Will Horton. I received a letter from a mom in the Midwest, and she said that she had always known that her son was gay but they never talked about it, or they never even acknowledged it, and she said that seeing Will Horton come out of the closet gave them a roadmap to have that conversation for the very first time." Sonny sees them at it, and Will is "super embarrassed" and he seeks his grandma Marlena's advice "so she could make everything better". Will tells her he that he thinks he might be gay, and she says "Honey, I think it's okay. Remember that Lady Gaga song you played for me once where she said that sexuality is like the color of your eyes? It’s a thing that you’re born with?
