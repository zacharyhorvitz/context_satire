 The world comes to New York this week, accompanied by baggage full of crises. It's the 69th annual United Nations General Assembly special debate, and it has not been a peaceful year. The 120-plus presidents and prime ministers maneuvering through New York City traffic will be grappling with issues such as ISIS, Ebola and Ukraine in their public speeches and private diplomacy. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, "the world is facing multiple crises.  For a while, it seemed that the threat from ISIS was limited to sparsely populated desert regions in the Middle East. Through brutal tactics and persecution of minorities, the Sunni extremist group brought slaughter and chaos to large areas of Syria and Iraq. But its merciless efforts to establish its version of an Islamic caliphate unsettled the wider region, prompting U.S. airstrikes aimed at stemming its advance. The Islamic militant group has responded by beheading three of its Western hostages in recent weeks, ratcheting up the crisis.  The United States is doing what it must to "take the fight to terrorists," leading a coalition of Arab nations in a series of airstrikes against the so-called Islamic State terror group in Syria, U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday. At the same time, the United States took action -- on its own -- against another terrorist organization, the Khorasan Group. Obama described its members as "seasoned al Qaeda operatives in Syria." U.S. officials said the group was plotting attacks against the United States and other Western targets.
