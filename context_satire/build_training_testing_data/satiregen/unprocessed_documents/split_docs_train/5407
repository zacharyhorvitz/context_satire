 The majority of American adults use dietary supplements. That number has remained steady for about the past decade, according to a new study, despite an increase in the number of studies that show that many supplements, with some exceptions, produce mixed results at best or, at worst, have no real health benefits at all. The study appears in the latest edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Americans spent about $34.9 billion on supplements in 2013 alone, according to National Institutes of Health research.  Americans generally enjoy what they do for a living, but they are concerned about diminishing job security. So finds a new report from the Pew Research Center, in association with the Markle Foundation. The study looked at how the shifting economic landscape is reshaping work and society. The findings are based on interviews with 5,006 adults conducted in May and June and also Census data.  A confrontation on a Manhattan street has triggered the emergence of the hashtag #Thisis2016. In a season of heightened racial tension, the hashtag is being used to document racist moments Asian Americans have faced in the U.S. Michael Luo, a New York Times editor, started the trend Monday after he shared his own experience over the weekend. He told CNNMoney he has received "an avalanche" of responses. "It's resonating because Asian Americans have this feeling that racism against them is not taken as seriously as other groups," said Luo.
