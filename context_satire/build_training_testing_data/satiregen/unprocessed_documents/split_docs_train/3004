Alexandra "Alex" Danvers (portrayed by Chyler Leigh; season 1–present) is Kara's adoptive sister. A brilliant scientist with a past as a party girl, she was hired by Hank Henshaw at the D.E.O. after being arrested for drunk driving, in an effort to turn her life around and see potential in her. As Henshaw's protégée, Alex was personally trained by him in extensive combat, strategic tactics, and investigation after joining the DEO, eventually becoming his right-hand agent in the field. In April 2011, Kennedy wrote an article for The Boston Globe Magazine about her family life growing up and her father's influence on her. Kennedy revealed her close relationship with her father, and the role he played in helping her to wage her battle against lung cancer. Though McCartney had a strained relationship with Lennon, they briefly became close again in early 1974, and played music together on one occasion. In later years, the two grew apart. While McCartney would often phone Lennon, he was apprehensive about the reception he would receive. During one call, Lennon told him, "You're all pizza and fairytales!"
