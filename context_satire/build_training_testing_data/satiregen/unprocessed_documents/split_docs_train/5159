Owing to the extremely large number (730) of school districts, many of which are quite small, most of them are organized into 37 supervisory districts. Each of these has a Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES). Each BOCES provides services that are considered difficult for the member school districts to provide on their own, often including special classes for students with disabilities. As of 2008, the faculty of Scarsdale High School began replacing Advanced Placement classes with a locally devised curriculum, Advanced Topics, that is intended to be more difficult. The initial courses covered the visual arts and social studies. Michael V. McGill, superintendent, stated that Advanced Topics stresses factual content and critical thinking. Homes in the Edgemont School District cost less than their counterparts in the Scarsdale Union Free School District, due to the latter being more known for its excellent school system and closer to the Scarsdale Train Station. The Edgemont School District, however, has higher property taxes due to a Greenburgh tax.
