 In Highlands County, Florida, where the power went out for almost everyone, the days after Hurricane Irma are full of anguish. "It's just hot. I mean it's been miserable for everyone," resident Adam Keene said. For the fourth straight day, people in this south-central Florida county faced sweltering heat without power.  President Donald Trump returned on Thursday to the storm-swept American South, handing out food and meeting with survivors on the Gulf coast of Florida, where Hurricane Irma raged last weekend. In the Naples and Fort Myers area, Trump received updates on recovery efforts from state and local authorities and viewed damage caused by the monster storm. As he flew from city to city, Trump passed over flooded neighborhoods aboard Marine One, the presidential helicopter. Inside a torn-apart mobile home community here, Trump distributed meals alongside his wife, first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Pence's wife, Karen.  President Donald Trump plans to visit storm-stricken Florida on Thursday, the White House said, his third such trip to a weather devastated state after a spate of violent US weather. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, made the announcement during Tuesday's daily briefing. "The President's action during these times demonstrate why he's a true leader who can bring the country together and get things done for the American people," Sanders said. Shortly after, first lady Melania Trump tweeted that she would accompany her husband to Florida on Thursday.
