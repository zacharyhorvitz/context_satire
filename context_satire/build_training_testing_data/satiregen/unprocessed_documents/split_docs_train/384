After his partner is murdered in Singapore, Roy Kenner travels to Bombay in search of the killer, a man named Tom Jordan. He meets a fatherless young boy, Saji, and begins to fall in love with the boy's mother, Anasuya, then takes Saji under his wing when she is accidentally killed. After a final confrontation with Jordan atop a building, Kenner takes the boy home with him to America. His law school, Cumberland School of Law, continues to honor him with a Cordell Hull Speaker's Forum and the pictured Moot Court Room. By 1643 Melford Hall was in the hands of Robert Cordell, first of the Cordell baronets, the great-grandson of his uncle Robert Cordell (died 1548), a brewer in the City of London, and his wife Margaret Hodge.
