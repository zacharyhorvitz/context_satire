 Hurricane Harvey has dumped about 2 feet of rain along Texas' Gulf Coast, an amount that could double in some places before the storm is done battering the region. And when the waters finally recede, the extent of the damage will be revealed -- from soggy and broken keepsakes to waterlogged cars and wrecked homes and businesses. The total destruction that Harvey will bring is far from clear. AIR Worldwide, a risk modeling company, estimated Monday that insured losses from just the winds and storm surge could reach more than $2.3 billion.  There's no doubt that the Houston economy will take a hit from Hurricane Harvey. But a lot depends on how many city residents stick around  after the water recedes. The reason: Population levels affect the number of jobs available and, ultimately, the level of economic activity. Twelve years after Katrina, the population of New Orleans still hasn't recovered.  The Texas economy was just getting back on its feet, but Hurricane Harvey could change that. When the bottom dropped out of oil prices in 2016, the state took a big hit and unemployment soared. Things turned around this year, but the storm could deliver a blow to that recovery, according to experts. A lot depends on how much damage Harvey does to the extensive cluster of refinery and petrochemical factories in the region, which are all in the process of shutting down ahead of the storm.
