The Mayo Clinic is an American not-for-profit organization academic medical center based in Rochester, Minnesota, focused on integrated clinical practice, education, and research. It employs more than 4,500 physicians and scientists, along with another 58,400 administrative and allied health staff. The practice specializes in treating difficult cases through tertiary care and destination medicine. It is home to the top-ten ranked Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine in addition to many of the largest, best regarded residency education programs in the United States. In Anglo-America, the most common term for the jam- or jelly-filled pastry is "jelly doughnut". The name is somewhat misleading, since the jam or jelly used is specially made with less pectin, so that it does not "set" like jams and jellies manufactured for table use but has a consistency comparable to Bavarian cream. The cream or custard-filled varieties usually also feature chocolate icing and are sometimes called Bavarian cream or Boston cream doughnuts (the latter name from its resemblance to Boston cream pie). The Boston cream doughnut has been designated the official state doughnut of Massachusetts. The three main buildings at the site are the Davis Building, the Mayo Building (including the hospital) and the Cannaday Building. They are connected to two hotels, The Inn at Mayo Clinic and Marriott’s Courtyard Jacksonville Mayo Clinic/Beaches. Laboratory research is also conducted on Mayo’s campus. Mayo’s research is focused on cancer, neurological and neuro-degenerative diseases.
