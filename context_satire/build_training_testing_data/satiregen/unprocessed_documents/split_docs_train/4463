They were also different in work styles. Woodward's strength was in investigation, so he focused on investigating the Watergate scandal. He met the ‘Deep throat’ secretly to get as much information as possible. His writing was serious and matter-of-fact.  President Donald Trump's chief of staff John Kelly should resign and testify before Congress about his time in the White House, legendary investigative journalist Carl Bernstein said. Bernstein, now a CNN political analyst, defended his former colleague Bob Woodward's explosive new book "Fear: Trump in the White House" on CNN's "New Day" Wednesday morning, which includes reporting that Kelly called Trump an "idiot" and "unhinged." "(The book) is a reconstruction of meeting after meeting after meeting in which you begin to wonder why doesn't John Kelly, the chief of staff, go to the Congress of the United States in executive session, resign for the good of the country, go to the Congress and say 'I want to answer all of your questions about this president in full about what the context is, about what's in this book, et cetera, et cetera,' and then let's see how it holds up," Bernstein said. Having read the book, Bernstein said it includes scenes "described in great detail" that show how "principals, not disgruntled former employees" view their job in the White House as "protecting the country from the President of the United States."  President Donald Trump called journalist Bob Woodward on August 14, CNN has learned, apparently because the President was alarmed by reports that Woodward is publishing a new book about him. Woodward recorded the call with Trump's permission and CNN obtained a full transcript of the conversation. The Washington Post first reported on the 11-minute call. Trump has been complimentary of Woodward in the past, and initially his manner was friendly.
