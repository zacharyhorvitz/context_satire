A bomb is detonated in the United States Capitol, sending the White House into lockdown. Finnerty escorts the Speaker to an underground command center in the Pentagon, while Vice President Alvin Hammond (Michael Murphy) is taken aboard Air Force One. A team of mercenaries disguised as video technicians led by ex-Delta Force operative Emil Stenz (Jason Clarke) infiltrate the White House and overwhelm the Secret Service, taking the tour group hostage in the Blue Room and seizing the building. Cale escapes to find Emily, separated during the tour.  The U.S. Secret Service is proposing a "taller and stronger" White House fence following an increasing number of people attempting to breach the security encircling the executive mansion. The proposed new design of the fence incorporates "anti-climb features" and "intrusion detection technology," a Secret Service spokeswoman said in a statement. The new design features a fence that is 11 feet and seven inches tall. The statement did not say how much the new fence would cost. Flynn was an important link in the connections between Putin and Trump in the "Ukraine peace plan", an unofficial plan "organized outside regular diplomatic channelsÂ ... at the behest of top aides to President Putin". This plan, aimed at easing the sanctions imposed on Russia, progressed from Putin and his advisors to Ukrainian politician Andrey Artemenko, Felix Sater, Michael Cohen, and Flynn, where he would have then presented it to Trump. The New York Times reported that Sater delivered the plan "in a sealed envelope" to Cohen, who then passed it on to Flynn in February 2017, just before his resignation.
