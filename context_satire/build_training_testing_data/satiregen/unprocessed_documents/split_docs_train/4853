Daniel Craig's first James Bond film, Casino Royale, does not feature the "James Bond Theme" in its entirety until the very end of the movie during a climactic scene. In Casino Royale, the main notes of the song "You Know My Name" are played throughout the film as a substitute for the "James Bond Theme". A new recording of the classic theme, titled "The Name's Bondâ€¦James Bond", only plays during the end credits to signal the beginning of the character's new arc as the 21st century version of James Bond. Although that is the first time the theme is played in its entirety, the first bars of the song (the chord progression) appeared as a slow background music in seven moments throughout the movie: after Bond's conversation with M (during his flight), after winning the Aston Martin, when he makes his first appearance in a tuxedo (accompanied by a few bars of the bridge), after he has survived the poisoned martini, when he wins the final match at Casino Royale, when Bond is following Vesper Lynd, and when Bond speaks with M on the phone. A report on the launch of the film on 25 April 2019 stated that Rami Malek had joined the cast as the villain. By that time, Daniel Craig had made it clear that this would be his final role as Bond. This film will begin with Bond no longer on active service and living in Jamaica until Leiter requests his assistance in rescuing a kidnapped scientist. The final script was written Purvis and Wade with the involvement of Scott Z. Burns and Phoebe Waller-Bridge.  The past is new again for agent 007: The next James Bond film will be called "Spectre." Director Sam Mendes announced the name of the 24th official Bond film Thursday at England's Pinewood Studios. Austrian actor Christoph Waltz will join Daniel Craig in the cast. Craig makes his fourth appearance as the rugged British secret service agent.
