 There are a few things you can usually expect out of an NFL halftime show. A debate about gun control isn't one of them. But Sunday wasn't a normal day in the NFL. It was two days after Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher shot and killed his girlfriend and the mother of his child before killing himself outside the front door of the Chiefs' practice facility.  The show went on. One day after police say Kansas City Chiefs player Jovan Belcher fatally shot his girlfriend and then himself, the team faced off against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday, as scheduled. Immediately after the apparent murder-suicide, there had been some question as to whether the game would happen. It did, though a moment of silence was held before play got under way, and the mood at Arrowhead Stadium was somber.  We always want answers. NFL linebacker Jovan Belcher, 25, shot to death the mother of his child, and then shot himself in the head in the middle of the afternoon Saturday outside the team's Kansas City practice facility. The day before, a man killed his father's live-in girlfriend and then burst into a Wyoming college classroom where his father taught and killed him, police said. The man then ended his own life.
