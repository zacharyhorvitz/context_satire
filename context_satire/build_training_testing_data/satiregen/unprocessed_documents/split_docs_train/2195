In his 1995 memoir, A Good Life, former Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee singled out Woodward in the foreword. "It would be hard to overestimate the contributions to my newspaper and to my time as editor of that extraordinary reporter, Bob Woodwardâ€”surely the best of his generation at investigative reporting, the best I've ever seen.... And Woodward has maintained the same position on top of journalism's ladder ever since Watergate."  The Washington Post Company announced Monday it was selling its newspaper business, including the flagship Washington Post, to Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos for $250 million. Bezos, whose net worth has been estimated at over $25 billion, is acquiring the Post personally and not through Amazon.com. He is gaining control of the newspaper from the Graham family, which has led it for decades. The Post Company will change its name as part of the transaction, though a new name has yet to be announced.  The last couple of days have been a whirlwind for the newspaper industry, with both The Washington Post and The Boston Globe finding new owners. Is The Los Angeles Times next? The sale of the Post in particular came as a shock to many in the media industry. The venerable D.C. paper, long run by the Graham family, was sold along with several smaller titles to  Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos for $250 million.
