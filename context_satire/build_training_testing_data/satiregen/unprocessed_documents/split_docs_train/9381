NPR critic Bob Mondello adds that "despite working with a plot about implacable malice, the Coen Brothers don't ever overdo. You could even say they know the value of understatement: At one point they garner chills simply by having a character check the soles of his boots as he steps from a doorway into the sunlight. By that time, blood has pooled often enough in No Country for Old Men that they don't have to show you what he's checking for." In a May 2018 interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Harrelson mentioned his study of theology and that he had considered becoming a minister. He explained that he became disillusioned with the church during his studies at college: "I started to see how man-made the Bible was and then I started saying, 'I could put this whole thing on hold for a while...let's just put this whole idea on hold so I can have my twenties and thirties of extreme hedonism.'" He stated that he currently has a belief in God, which he attributed to reading Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda, whom he described as a "man of integrity". In 2017, he played the antagonist The Colonel in the science fiction film War for the Planet of the Apes. Also that year, he starred in The Glass Castle, an adaptation of Jeannette Walls's memoir about how she was raised by dysfunctional and nonconformist parents and then had her world turned upside down when they moved to New York to be near her. Brie Larson played Walls and Harrelson played her father. The comedic drama was directed by Destin Daniel Cretton.
