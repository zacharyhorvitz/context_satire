The play was originally to have been staged at Theater J, a Jewish theater in Washington, D.C. in May 2010, but was canceled after Wiesel made his objections known. After Ari Roth, artistic director of Theater J, had offered to submit the play to Wiesel's foundation for review, Margolin objected, viewing the offer as giving Wiesel veto power over the play's content. Margolin called the experience "painful" and said that she was "still scared to talk about it" because of fear of lawsuits, but she felt that she "didn't want to abandon this play". Though the character of Wiesel was formally excised from the play, the replacement character Solomon Galkin, described in the play's script as "80 years old, Holocaust survivor, poet, translator, treasurer of his synagogue", retained most of the dialogue that had originally been planned for the Wiesel character. Cargas was first introduced to the subject of the Holocaust when he read an excerpt from Elie Wiesel's biographical work Night in a magazine one evening. For the rest of his life after that initial intellectual encounter, much of his scholarly work revolved around the Holocaust and the relations between Jews and Catholics. His mission was to bring "historic truth to his Church" and to provoke Catholic leadership to acknowledge both its role in allowing the Holocaust to happen, as well as its inaction and silence during the war. In particular, he was horrified by the idea that almost "every Jew killed in the Holocaust was murdered by a baptized Christian." Elie Wiesel is well-known for his memoir Night that later spawned the trilogy of which Day is the final book. Wiesel has written more than fifty books and has won the Nobel Peace Prize. Soon after earning the Nobel Prize, Wiesel and his wife Marion founded The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity.
