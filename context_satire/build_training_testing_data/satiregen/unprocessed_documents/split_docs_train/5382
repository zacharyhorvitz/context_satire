On the July 18, 2016 episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Colbert is revealed to have been living with a now-retired Stewart in a remote cabin in a forest. In the skit, the real Colbert visited Stewart, asking him to explain how Donald Trump became the 2016 Republican nominee for president. Perplexed, Stewart turned to Colbert the character, who  briefly returned to television to deliver an edition of "The Word" explaining Trump's appeal, before turning the show back to "that other guy", the real Colbert. The Colbert Report (/koʊlˈbɛər rɪˌpɔːr/ kohl-BAIR rih-por) is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005, to December 18, 2014, for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a "well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor. Following Colbert's segment on the July 18 program, CBS's legal team was informed by Viacom that the character Stephen Colbert is their intellectual property and cannot appear on The Late Show. As a result, on the July 27, 2016 episode of The Late Show, the real Colbert announced that the character "will never be seen again". He then immediately introduced Stephen Colbert's "identical twin cousin" (a possible allusion to The Patty Duke Show), Stephen Colbert, as a new member of The Late Show team. Colbert stated the difference between him and the other Colbert is they have birthmarks of the opposite Olsen twins.
