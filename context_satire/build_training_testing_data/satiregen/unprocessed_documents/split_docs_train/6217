On October 26, 2018, MSU's board of directors voted to fully integrate the College of Law into the university, thereby converting it from a private to a public law school. Dean Lawrence Ponoroff said, "Since the original affiliation in 1995, the relationship between the university and the law college has grown increasingly closer and, at each stage, resounded in benefits to both institutions." This move was intended to facilitate collaboration between the law school and other divisions of MSU, opening up development in fields such as autonomous vehicles, the food industry, and health law. Additionally, this decision was stated to be a way for the law college to better leverage its close geographic connection with the Michigan State Capitol. In addition to faculty, Michigan State has around 6,000 administration and non-academic staff. This includes the university's governing board, the Board of Trustees. Elected by statewide referendum every two years, trustees have eight-year terms, with two of the eight elected every other year. As of 2007, the board is made up of three Republicans and five Democrats, and has a 4:4 gender balance. The University of Michigan (UM, U-M, U of M, or UMich), often simply referred to as Michigan, is a  public research university in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The university is Michigan's oldest; it was founded in 1817 in Detroit, as the Catholepistemiad, or University of Michigania, 20 years before the territory became a state. The school was moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 onto 40 acres (16 ha) of what is now known as Central Campus. Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the flagship university campus has expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than 34 million gross square feet (780 acres; 3.2 km2) spread out over a Central Campus and North Campus, two regional campuses in Flint and Dearborn, and a Center in Detroit.
