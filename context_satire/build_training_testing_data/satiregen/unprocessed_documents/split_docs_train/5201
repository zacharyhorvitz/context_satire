Drew and De Vries return to the U.S., discovering that, as Harry made some brilliant investiments in the world's stock markets when he was alive, earned a millionaire fortune that was inherited to Drew. As they check out the reach in Granby, Colorado for their future house, Witkowski arrives and tries convincing Drew to return to work. Drew immediately refuses. In the season four premiere "Rise" Beckett barely survives the assassination attempt on her and takes three months off to recuperate. In this time Castle, Ryan and Esposito were tracking the money of Montgomery, Raglan and McCallister, but the evidence was destroyed in a fire in 1998. Beckett doesn't want to believe this, and only after Castle has a long talk to her does Beckett decide to see her therapist again. Castle only talked so seriously to her about this because of a call he received  from a "mysterious man", who claimed to be an old friend of Montgomery and in possession of the evidence against the dragon and is now blackmailing him in order to keep Beckett safe. In "Hedge Fund Homeboys", for the first time, Beckett starts to soften up for Castle by joking with him about all the schools that he was kicked out of and now that he's become famous, they all claim him as an alumnus. Additionally, Beckett is starting to be able to 'read' Castle to know some of his 'looks'.
