In 1946-48 a Temporary Commission on the Need for a State University, chaired by Owen D. Young, Chairman of the General Electric Company, studied New York's existing higher education institutions. It was known New York's private institutions of higher education were highly discriminatory and failed to provide for many New Yorkers. Noting this need, the commission recommended the creation of a public state university system. In 1948 legislation was passed establishing SUNY on the foundation of the teacher-training schools established in the 19th century.  Before Christine signed a new two-bedroom apartment lease, the 30-something mother of four called a shelter for domestic violence victims a temporary "home." At the shelter, she was introduced to FreeFrom, a startup that's piloting entrepreneurship programs for domestic violence survivors. Christine is one of 30 women, from ages 25 to 55, participating in FreeForm's programs across Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland. Since enrolling in the program in May, Christine -- who spoke to CNN under a pseudonym -- now runs an essential oil business made of natural products for mothers and children.
