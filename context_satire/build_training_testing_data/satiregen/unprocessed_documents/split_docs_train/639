 A British teenager who joined ISIS in 2015 says she wants to return home. Shamima Begum, who left the UK with two of her classmates from east London when she was 15, was found in a refugee camp in northern Syria by UK newspaper The Times. Now 19, and nine months pregnant, Begum told the paper that she "just want(s) to come home to have my child." Begum said she had no regrets about coming to Syria, but told the paper that "the caliphate is over."  In a series of tweets, President Donald Trump has said European countries should take back and put on trial hundreds of ISIS fighters who have been captured in Syria. "Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing," the US President tweeted late Saturday night. He warned that as ISIS is "ready to fall," more than 800 prisoners could make their way to Europe. "The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them," Trump tweeted.  Thousands of civilians remain inside ISIS's last enclave in Syria, a commander with the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Friday. The commander, who is currently inside the small town of Baghouz Al-Fawqani in the country's east, told CNN a large number of civilians are still in the area under ISIS control. He added that civilians are leaving the ISIS camp through tunnels and buildings. "We are getting messages from the civilians coming out that many of the ISIS fighters want to surrender and as many as 200 to 300 ISIS fighters don't want to surrender and want to fight till the end," the commander told CNN's Ben Wedeman.
