 George Zimmerman showed little emotion as the verdict was read. But after months in which the weight of the world seemingly lay on his shoulder, a period in which he was called everything from a murderer to a racist to a pig-headed jerk, more emotion would be very understandable, if not expected. After all, he was a free man. Yet his story didn't end there.  A Florida judge on Tuesday set bail for George Zimmerman at $9,000 and ordered a number of conditions for his freedom -- including that he not possess weapons -- while he awaits trial on charges he pointed a shotgun at his girlfriend. He was released from the John E. Polk Correctional Facility on Tuesday afternoon. He didn't speak with the media. It was unclear where he was headed.  Archaeologists have uncovered rare prehistoric finds while digging at a construction site in Israel, including much of a 10,000-year-old house, a 6,000-year temple as well as axes. The findings provide a "broad picture" of human development over thousands of years -- from the time when people first started domesticating animals and plants to the early days of urban planning, the Israel Antiquities Authority said. The site will be open to the public Wednesday, it said. The discoveries, including a house that dates from the eighth millennium B.C., were unearthed at Eshtaol, about 17 miles west of Jerusalem, ahead of the widening of a highway.
