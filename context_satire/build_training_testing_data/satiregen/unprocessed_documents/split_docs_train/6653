Another incident involved a violation of procedure in which an armed security guard for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rode in the same elevator as President Barack Obama during a visit to that agency's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, to discuss U.S. response to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. The guard used his phone to record a video of Obama and refused to comply with a request to stop. The guard had been arrested multiple times in the past, but had never been convicted of a crime.  President Barack Obama told reporters at the White House that he will hold a news conference on Friday. Obama responded to a shouted question at an appearance on Thursday with the Greek prime minister that he would hold a news conference the next day. The president is scheduled to go on vacation next week with his family, while Congress is away for its summer break.  President Barack Obama faces a long list of issues when he steps to the podium in the White House East Room on Friday for a news conference. The last time he took questions from reporters was June 30, during his trip to Africa. Since then, the White House has embarked on a campaign-style tour pushing its economic agenda, while unforeseen issues like the recent unprecedented embassy closures because of a terror threat and the strained relationship with Russia over NSA leaker Edward Snowden have taken center stage. With all those as possible topics for reporters to press the president on -- here are some questions that could come up.
