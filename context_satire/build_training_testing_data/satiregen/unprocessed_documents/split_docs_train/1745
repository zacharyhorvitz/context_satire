From late 2012 until August 2013, a group of engineers from both Tesla and SpaceX worked on the conceptual modeling of Hyperloop. An early system design was published in the Tesla and SpaceX blogs which describes one potential design, function, pathway, and cost of a hyperloop system. According to the alpha design, pods would accelerate to cruising speed gradually using a linear electric motor and glide above their track on air bearings through tubes above ground on columns or below ground in tunnels to avoid the dangers of grade crossings. An ideal hyperloop system will be more energy-efficient, quiet, and autonomous than existing modes of mass transit. As a storm approaches, most of the community—after securing windows and equipment—take shelter in the pub. Grimes stays out, and alone with Balstrode confesses his ambitions: to make his fortune with a "good catch", buy a good home and marry Ellen Orford. Balstrode suggests "without your booty  will have you now", only to provoke Grimes's furious "No, not for pity!" Balstrode abandons Grimes to the storm, as the latter ruminates "What harbour shelters peace?"  Elon Musk is admitting he messed up — sort of. Days after the Tesla boss shocked Wall Street by completely dismissing critical questions from two analysts as "boring," Musk said on Friday it was "foolish of me" to ignore the queries. Musk's insults, and his refusal even to respond to legitimate questions, made for one of the weirdest corporate earnings conference calls in recent memory. The bizarre performance sent Tesla stock plunging, wiping $2.8 billion off its market value — and $632 million off Musk's personal stake.
