 Former US Rep. Beto O'Rourke is ready to "push the button" to launch his presidential campaign, with the announcement expected to first come on social media, a source familiar with his plans told CNN. Aware that the 2020 Democratic primary is quickly taking shape, O'Rourke is set to announce his candidacy this week, rather than launching an exploratory committee. He will also travel to eastern Iowa beginning Thursday with a meet-and-greet event in Burlington, Democratic sources in the state said. The three-day itinerary for his first visit to the early-voting state is intended "to allow space for him to meet voters," said another Iowa Democratic official, who spoke to O'Rourke's advisers.  On a balcony looking down on Sen. Bernie Sanders' rally here last week, two banners hung side by side: one for the University of Iowa Democrats and another for the Young Democratic Socialists of America, the event's co-hosts. To the students in the crowd, the juxtaposition was unremarkable. On campus, one University Democrat told CNN, the groups have "a pretty good relationship" and, at least when it comes to social issues, "we definitely overlap with them." But for the dedicated democratic socialists in the hall -- a handful of whom traveled two hours from Iowa State University in Ames to see Sanders -- the image was a marker of the group's new influence â€” and increasing mainstream credentials.  On a trip to Iowa last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo got a tip from his team: the chain supermarket Hy-Vee located on his way to speak at a local high school is a go-to lunch spot for National Guard members. So on a bitter-cold Monday afternoon, Pompeo and his wife, Susan, warmed up over local grub at the no-frills grocery store. They chatted with locals, including a few National Guard members. There were no news camera crews and no photos tweeted out by the Secretary or the State Department.
