On May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, who was at a restaurant with his wife, to inform him that Osama bin Laden had been killed. The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At the Ground Zero memorial, Bush read a letter that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to a widow who had lost five sons during the Civil War. Prior to the funeral the next day, Lt. Col. Strobl meets PFC Phelps's family for the first time, and makes a point of mentioning that PFC Phelps was treated with great care and dignity across his entire journey. He hands over PFC Phelps's personal effects, as well as a letter from PFC Phelps's platoon leader. He finally leaves them with the cross that was given to him by a flight attendant, saying that eventually he realized it was not really given to him, only that he was carrying it for them. With the father's voiceover reading the platoon leader's letter in the background, we see PFC Phelps receive a funeral with full military honors, and his divorced parents are each presented with a flag, "on behalf of the President, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and a grateful nation," honoring their son. After her husband's death, Zara remarried in 1969 to one of his Liberal Party colleagues, Jeff Bate. She was widowed a second time in 1984, and died in 1989. In a 1988 interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Zara stated that her husband Harold had carried on "dozens" of extramarital affairs. In his biography of Holt, Tom Frame wrote: "I have not included the names of women with whom Holt allegedly had a sexual relationship because I was unable to confirm or deny that most of these relationships took place  by their very nature they were always illicit and Holt was very discreet."
