Born on October 10, 1935, the first Mike was purchased from the Little Rock Zoo with money raised by collecting 25 cents from each LSU student for a total of $750. Originally named Sheik, the new mascot was renamed in honor of Mike Chambers, LSU's athletic trainer at the time, who was the person most responsible for bringing him to the school. (It was later discovered that "Sheik" may have been fond of his original name, because even years later, handlers could get him to roar just by calling "Sheik!") Mike assumed his duties as the living symbol of LSU only three days after arriving on campus on October 21, 1936. While still a teenager, Chambers' older brother would take him to the Redondo Beach ca pier where he would perform his moves for money. He claims to have earned hundreds of dollars through his street performances. To solve the problem of anonymity, Chambers' sister gave him a jacket that read "Mike aka Boogaloo Shrimp", his street dancing name. Chambers' dancing would increasingly draw the attention of promoters, and particularly  Adolpho "Shabba Doo" Quinones, who was seeking to form a new dance troupe after the breakup of his previous group, The Lockers. Police were given Chambers' name by patrons at Dorrian's Red Hand, who had seen him leaving with Levin. When authorities arrived to question Chambers at his home, he had fresh scratches on his face and arms, which he initially said were "cat scratches". He was taken in for questioning.
