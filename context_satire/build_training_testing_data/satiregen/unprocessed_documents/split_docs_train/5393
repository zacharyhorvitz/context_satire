Jeremiah Danvers (portrayed by Dean Cain) is a scientist and Alex's biological father and Kara's foster father, who offered his services to the DEO by working with Hank in order to protect Kara. Ten years earlier and under mysterious circumstances, he and Hank went to South America to capture J'onn J'onzz, with whom Jeremiah became friends after the alien saved him. When Hank caught up and saw them shake hands, he tried to kill J'onn, leading to a fight between Jeremiah and Hank while trying to keep Hank from killing J'onzz; Hank then stabbed Jeremiah, who later killed him in self-defense, collapsed on the ground, and was left for dead. He asked J'onzz to watch over his daughters. In 2011, Kara Swisher nearly lost her life when on a trip to Hong Kong she began to feel ill and went to the hospital urgently after finding out she was suffering from a stroke, which would be confirmed by the doctors who saved her. She wrote about her experience in a remembrance of Luke Perry, after a stroke led to his death in 2019. I love that she has all this power and has to learn what it is to be a superhero in the DCU," said Loeb. "It's one thing to try that with Manhunter (which is terrific), but when you have an icon like Supergirl trying to find her way and, at the same time, at a power level that we haven't even begun to exploreÂ ... it should make for a bitchin' good time.
