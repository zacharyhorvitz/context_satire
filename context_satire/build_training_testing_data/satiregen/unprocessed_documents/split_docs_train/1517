In the spring of 1967, the band started to fragment. Martynec left to form Kensington Market in May and was replaced by former Majestics keyboard player Jimmy Oskirko. The new lineup started to experiment more and played regularly at the Concord Tavern where the band performed a cover of The Beatles' "A Day in the Life". This version of the group also opened for Jose Feliciano at Massey Hall. During its first year, the band established a solid fan base on southern Ontario's dance circuit, billed either as E. G. Smith & The Power or as Grant Smith & The Power. Shortly after a June 27, 1967 show at the Broom and Stone in Scarborough, Toronto, Charlie Miller left the band. With the lineup reduced to a single drummer, Wayne Stone cut his teeth in the solo drummer chair at a week-long summer resort gig in Grand Bend, Ontario, after which the band headed to the United States, spending 1967's famous "Summer of Love" working clubs in the Boston area and in upstate New York. On the band's return to Toronto in early September, Jim Pauley left the band and was replaced by guitarist Jon Palma. The new line-up continued to play extensively in the Toronto area, although no other singles appeared. They were one of 14 local groups to play at a 14-hour pop show at the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on September 24, 1966. The following month, former member Jerry Shymanski joined Eddie Spencer & The Power, which evolved into Grant Smith & The Power.
