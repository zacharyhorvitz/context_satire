In some institutions called "Technical Schools" there is an extra grade, for those who want to graduate as "Middle technician" in a certain area. This education would allow them to be hired at a higher level, or get introduced more easily into a college career. Before that, there were no official middle school programs implemented and the equivalent years was simply called "High School" which ranged from First Year to Fourth Year. Prior to its formation in 1971, students from the Rocky Point area attending public school attended school in Port Jefferson, New York. It was Rocky Point Junior Senior High School, (7th-12th grade) until the opening of the Rocky Point Middle School in September 2002. The first graduating class in Rocky Point was 1975, because from 1971 to 1974 it was not yet considered a high school.
