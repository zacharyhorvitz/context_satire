 Elon Musk, who tweeted last week that he had "funding secured" to take Tesla private, says he was referring to conversations he had with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. In a blog post early Monday, the Tesla CEO wrote that the Saudi fund had approached him "multiple times" about taking the electric car company private. Musk said he left a July 31 meeting "with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving." Sovereign wealth funds are investment funds controlled by a national government.  Tesla isn't on board with CEO Elon Musk's plan to take the company private, at least not yet. The company's directors said Tuesday that they had formed a special committee of three independent board members to study the proposal. And they cautioned that the board has yet to endorse the idea of taking the electric car maker private. "The special committee has not yet received a formal proposal from Mr. Musk regarding any going private transaction nor has it reached any conclusion as to the advisability or feasibility of such a transaction," said the statement.  Elon Musk's latest big idea is daring even by his standards: He wants to turn Tesla into a private company. He stunned investors on Tuesday with a tweet saying he had already lined up the funding, and he told employees that it would relieve the electric car company of the "enormous pressure" of Wall Street's expectations. In a letter to Tesla workers that was posted on the company's blog, Musk called his idea the "best path forward." "As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders," he wrote.
