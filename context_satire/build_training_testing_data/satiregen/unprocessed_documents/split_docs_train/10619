From the beginning of his tenure, Murthy spoke about the importance of creating a culture of prevention in America, one that is grounded in physical activity, nutrition, and emotional well-being. As part of this effort, he issued Step It Up! The Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Promote Walking and Walkable Communities. For the one-year anniversary of the Call to Action, he led a two-week public- private partnership with Fitbit called the Step it Up Challenge that engaged over 600,000 people to increase their physical activity with an industry record-setting 60 billion steps. During his tenure, Murthy created initiatives to tackle our country’s most urgent public health issues. In releasing the first-ever Surgeon General’s Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health, Murthy worked with the nation's leading researchers to compile the latest scientific  data on addiction and issued a call to action to the nation to recognize addiction as a chronic illness, not a moral failing. He worked with Republican and Democratic elected officials and hundreds of partner organizations to bring attention to this critical issue and to expand access to prevention and treatment. He also released a public service announcement with the cast of Mom that doubled the number of people who called into a substance use hotline to ask for help. Additionally, he launched the TurnTheTide campaign and sent a personal letter to millions of health care professionals urging them to join a movement to tackle the opioid epidemic. The unprecedented letter sparked opioid-related initiatives in healthcare settings across the country. Responding to a growing chorus of questions from parents, teachers, and lawmakers, he also released the first Surgeon General’s Report on E-cigarettes Use Among Youth highlighting the health risks of e-cigarette use for youth.
