 Will the devastation of Superstorm Sandy tone down the hostile rhetoric of the presidential campaign? The answer Wednesday was yes, at least by President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney, who left it to surrogates and others to do the political dirty work. Obama avoided any overt political statements when he toured storm damage in New Jersey with Republican Gov. Chris Christie, a frequent critic who has praised the president's response to the disaster.  President Barack Obama is accusing Republican Mitt Romney of changing his promises and policies so thoroughly that he's dubs it "Romnesia," but the U.S. election campaign has itself changed dramatically and Obama is scrambling to recover. "Attacking me is not an agenda," Romney said this week, during the third and final presidential debate ahead of the November 6 vote. The most dramatic change in the race is the crucial one: with less than two weeks to go, Romney is leading or tied with Obama in national public opinion polls, after having trailed him for months. Map: World weighs in on U.S. election A closer look reveals a more complicated picture, but it isn't entirely comforting to Obama either.  President Barack Obama insists he's ahead but is running like the underdog, adopting a street-fighting posture and campaigning himself hoarse across the country. Republican challenger Mitt Romney seeks to make his election seem inevitable and calls Obama's campaign desperate. A role reversal by the candidates that occurred over the course of the three presidential debates is continuing in the final stage of the race, portending frenzied politicking until voters deliver the verdict on November 6. For Obama, that means more campaign swings like the two-day trip to eight states this week -- including his "all-nighter" on Air Force One, as well as events targeting younger audiences.
