 President Donald Trump will make his final pitch on tax reform to the American people Wednesday in a speech that will not "lean in on as many of the specifics as his prior tax reform speeches," according to two senior administration officials who briefed reporters Tuesday. The administration sees this as a higher-altitude speech, saying the President has already addressed specific rate brackets in previous speeches. Joined by about 120 people -- families and military personnel who have been invited -- the President will speak Wednesday afternoon from the Grand Foyer of the White House. Some young people will be among those invited, and the President will dedicate a "very significant portion" of his speech to the next generation that will be affected by tax reform. In 1920, Cleveland proper boasted a foreign-born population of 30% and, in 1870, that percentage was 42%. Although the foreign-born population of Cleveland today is not as big as it once was, the sense of identity remains strong among the city's various ethnic communities, as reflected in the Cleveland Cultural Gardens. Recent waves of immigration to Cleveland have brought new groups to the city, including additional numbers of Russians and other nationalities from the former Soviet Union, as well as Albanians, Ethiopians, and South Asians. In the 2010s, the immigrant population of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County began to see significant growth, becoming one of the fastest growing centers for immigration in the Great Lakes region. At the time of the founding of the Cleveland Clinic, there was a great deal of opposition to the whole idea of a comprehensive group medical practice, but Crile, Bunts and Lower were sufficiently well respected in Cleveland — all three were professors at one or more of Cleveland medical schools, and each of the three, at one time or other was elected president of the local Academy of Medicine — that they were able to bring their plans for the Clinic to fruition.
