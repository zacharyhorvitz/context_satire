 It takes eight to 10 years to take hold and once symptoms emerge, it can leave people permanently disabled and disfigured in its wake. With a signature symptom of legs and feet swollen to enormous proportions, this parasite continues to infect 120 million worldwide and put almost 1.4 billion people at risk of infection, 500 million of whom are in India. The disease is lymphatic filariasis -- commonly known as elephantiasis -- and its symptoms leave images in the mind you may never forget. It is caused by a parasitic worm that is transmitted between people by mosquitoes. The World health report 2002 described the amount of disease, disability and death in the world that could be attributed to a selected number of the most important risks to human health. It projected how much this burden could lowered in the next 20 years if the same risk factors were reduced.  A British military health care worker in Sierra Leone has tested positive for Ebola, a UK health agency said. Medical experts are assessing what to do next, including whether or not the evacuate the infected individual to the United Kingdom for treatment, according to a Public Health England spokesperson. An Ebola outbreak has devastated parts of West Africa, with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia being the hardest hit nations. The vast majority of the more than 24,000 confirmed, reportable and suspected cases, as well as the nearly 10,000 reported deaths, have been in those three countries, the World Health Organization reports.
