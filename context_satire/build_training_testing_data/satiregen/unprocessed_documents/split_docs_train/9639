The actor explained to Lisa Anthony from BIG! that it took him six weeks to grow stubble, so he had to refrain from shaving for the six-month period. He did not like having facial hair for the role and he eventually "got fed up with it". Harrison was unsure as to why he was selected to play Revhead, he added "I really don't know why BIG!, I really don't". Morris' casting was publicised on 7 August 1988, just more than week before his character's debut on-screen. Bateman was delighted with Morris' casting and hoped he would become the show's main star. He told a reporter from Sunday Mail TV Plus that "John is going to be a massive hit. He's a very good looking man and very nice performer and will be a bigger star than Kylie Minogue." Revhead reappears eighteen months later after learning of Julie's relationship with police officer Nick and tries to split them up. He then becomes involved with Karen and leads her off the rails by encouraging her to skip school and smoke dope with him. He leaves town for several months but returns and hides out in his old house, which is to be sold and asks Karen to keep quiet. Revhead reveals that he robbed a pharmacy in the city and left a security guard in a coma and is on the run.
