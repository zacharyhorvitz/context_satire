Always and Forever, Lara Jean is a 2017 novel by American author Jenny Han, first published by Simon & Schuster and released on May 2, 2017. It is the third and final installment of the To All the Boys I've Loved Before series, following To All the Boys I've Loved Before, released on April 15, 2014, and P.S. I Still Love You, released on May 26, 2015. The Triple Hoax was originally listed as the next book at the end of The Thirteenth Pearl. Grosset & Dunlap continued to list this until they lost a court case against the Syndicate and Simon & Schuster in May 1980. The book was later revised to eliminate The Triple Hoax. However, they later published this book — and the seven after that — in 2005, with the permission and collaboration of Simon & Schuster, in celebration of Nancy Drew's 75th anniversary. In the 1980s, Snyder also made an unsuccessful bid toward video publishing which was believed to have led to the company's success in the audio book business. Snyder was dismayed to realize that Simon & Schuster did not own the video rights to Jane Fonda's Workout Book, a huge bestseller at the time, and that the video company producing the VHS was making more money on the video. This prompted Snyder to ask editors to obtain video rights for every new book. Agents were often reluctant to give these up—which meant the S&S Video division never took off.
