 President Donald Trump defended the federal government's response to the disaster in Puerto Rico, and contended difficulty accessing food and water was due to shortcomings on local distribution. "We have delivered tremendous amounts of water, and then what you have to do is you have to have distribution of the water by the people on the island," Trump said at a news conference on Monday from the White House. Trump noted the military is on the ground helping with distribution efforts -- which he argued shouldn't be their job. "What we've done is we now actually have military distributing food, something that really they shouldn't have to be doing," Trump said.  The death toll from Hurricane Maria has risen to 48 in Puerto Rico, the territory's Department of Public Safety said Saturday. Puerto Ricans still face a daily struggle for food, water and other necessities while coping with the devastation to their homes and businesses more than three weeks after the powerful hurricane slammed ashore on the US commonwealth. Among the recent deaths was a patient unable to get to dialysis treatment on time, and another person complaining of chest pains died after bad road conditions delayed a trip to the hospital, the department said. The number of deaths may rise, with about 117 people unaccounted for after last month's hurricane.  The House of Representatives approved Thursday a $36.5 billion disaster aid package to help victims struggling to recover from a string of devastating hurricanes and wildfires. The bill passed â€Ž353-69. The measure heads to the Senate, which returns from a weeklong recess next week. While the Trump administration requested $29 billion in supplemental spending last week, it asked for additional resources Tuesday night, including $4.9 billion to specifically to fund a loan program that Puerto Rico can use to address basic functions like infrastructure needs.
