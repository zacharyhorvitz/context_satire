 Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin sought to press Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday to call for an FBI investigation into allegations that have rocked his confirmation process. Durbin began his exchange with Kavanaugh at Thursday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing by noting that Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who testified earlier Thursday about her sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh, has called for an FBI investigation. President Donald Trump has declined to have the FBI look into the matter, and Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee chairman, has said an FBI investigation would not be appropriate or definitive. At the hearing, Durbin called on Kavanaugh to demand one.  The White House would be open to having Deborah Ramirez, the second woman to publicly accuse Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. "Certainly we would be open to that and that process could take place on Thursday," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on ABC News' "Good Morning America" Tuesday morning. "The President's been clear: Let's let them speak," Sanders said. "But let's also let Brett Kavanaugh speak, and let's let him tell his side of the story before we allow allegations to determine his entire future."  South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham forcefully defended Brett Kavanaugh against an allegation of sexual assault during a tense Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday and accused Democrats of wanting to "destroy" the life of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Immediately following an aggressive line of questioning by Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, Graham said angrily, "What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020." The Republican from South Carolina then turned his attention back to Kavanaugh and asked: "Are you a gang rapist?" Kavanaugh replied: "No."
