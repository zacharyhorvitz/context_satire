 He's broken nearly every bone in his body in one of the most exacting all sports -- on the way setting records for jump racing that many predict will never be surpassed -- but Thursday saw Northern Ireland's Tony McCoy reach a very special milestone. The 18-time champion jockey made it 4,000 career winners when he rode Mountain Tunes to victory at a meeting at Towcester racecourse in central England. The extent of McCoy's longevity and domination of racing over the fences in Britain and Ireland can be gauged by the fact that his nearest challenger, Richard Johnson, is some 1500 wins adrift of him. Victory on the 6-4 favorite came in typical style, two lengths behind at the final fence before driving his mount home in the novice hurdle to beat Jamie Moore on Kris Spin by half a length.  Mark and Kristine Wathke knew they were going to die. Stuck in a foot of snow on a road somewhere outside Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, the couple from Wisconsin pulled all the clothes out of their suitcases and wore them, trying to keep warm in their car with temperatures dipping below zero. They rationed the bread and water they had with them, and ran the car's engine periodically to get some heat. There was no service for their cell phone. Mark (?-September 18, 1755) (sometimes called Mark Codman) was an African-American man enslaved by John Codman (1696-1755) of Massachusetts in the Boston area  before the American Revolutionary War. Though some texts refer to Mark as "Mark Codman", he was probably not referred to as such during his life as giving a slave the surname of his master was not commonly done with New England slaves. The contemporary documents from the investigation and trial only use Mark for his name.Mark was a slave to Codman for a few years before his execution. He was accused of burning down a building about 6 years before his death to try to gain freedom.
