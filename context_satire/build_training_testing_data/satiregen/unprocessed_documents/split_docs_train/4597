 Sen. Ted Cruz, Donald Trump's former chief rival for the GOP nomination, will speak at the Republican National Convention later this month, the Texas senator told reporters after the two met Thursday in Washington. Cruz told reporters Thursday that the real estate mogul offered his former primary rival a speaking slot during the meeting and he accepted. He added that he and Trump did not discuss an endorsement. "We had a positive and productive meeting this morning with Donald Trump.  Donald Trump won't allow himself to catch a break. Twice this month, the presumptive Republican nominee has seemed to act against his own political interests after tumultuous events -- the Orlando terror attack and the U.K.'s Brexit vote -- that should have offered him political openings. Trump's inconsistent and often self-congratulatory response to such crises misses opportunities to portray himself and his insurgent, populist campaign as delivering the right message for testing times. It's also luring Trump into a trap set by his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who says he lacks the temperament and knowledge needed of a commander-in-chief.  Donald Trump came to Capitol Hill Thursday with the hopes of unifying the party, but his heated exchange with one of his fiercest congressional critics overshadowed those efforts. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee told Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake he would work to defeat him if he didn't change his tune. Flake, who has slammed Trump for his positions on immigration and his racially charged criticism of a Latino judge, reminded Trump that he is not up for re-election until 2018, according to two sources familiar with what occurred. "It was a bit tense," Flake told CNN Thursday afternoon.
