 Foxconn says it is returning to its plan to make flat screen panels at a new plant in Wisconsin following an appeal from President Donald Trump. The Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer caused a storm this week when it said it was considering dropping plans to build the panels at the facility, even though it said it was still anticipating hiring 13,000 workers. The company has been promised $4 billion in state and local incentives to develop the Wisconsin facility. In a statement Friday, Foxconn said that after a call between Trump and its chairman, Terry Gao, the company has decided to stick with its manufacturing plans after all.  Foxconn says it is moving ahead with its construction plans in Wisconsin, despite uncertainty about what it might eventually build there. The company is now looking to create a technology hub rather than the kind of traditional factory it originally planned, according to a statement. But it does plan to have some kind of manufacturing at the site even if most of the workers it eventually employs there are involved in research and development rather than manufacturing. Within the next 18 months, it will construct a high-precision molding factory, as well as a system-integration assembly facility.  Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn may drop plans to build flat screen panels at a Wisconsin plant for which it was promised $4 billion in state and local tax dollars. But the company says it is going ahead with developing the Wisconsin property and still expects to hire up to 13,000 workers. The plant and its expensive incentive package has been controversial from the time it was announced in 2017. It was negotiated during the tenure of former Republican Governor Scott Walker, who lost his re-election bid last year.
