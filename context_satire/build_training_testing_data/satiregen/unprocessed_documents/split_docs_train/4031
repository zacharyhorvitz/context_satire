The Pi chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon ("Deke") was founded in 1853. It was the fourth social fraternity at Dartmouth College. Eight brothers of Delta Kappa Epsilon were famously involved in a 1949 murder of a fellow Dartmouth student. The men, after heavy drinking at three different fraternities, sought out a former member of the freshman football team. Membership to Phi Delta Theta is open to all qualified men without concern for race, religion, or ethnicity. Initial membership to the fraternity is contingent upon receiving an invitation to an interested individual by members of an active chapter. A pledge of Phi Delta Theta is called a Phikeia. The typical pledge period lasts a minimum of eight weeks, although occasionally it is shortened or lengthened to fit university requirements or by approval of the General Council. The Florida International University chapter was suspended for two years after a thorough investigation found the chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon had violated the University’s student code of conduct, following the release of screenshots depicting “inappropriate content” in the group’s TKE private chat, where the fraternity’s group chat revealed photos of nude women, which had been shared without their consent, and offensive statements including Holocaust memes, jokes about rape and pedophilia and conversations about drug sales. The fraternity also got in trouble for hosting a tailgate party where a minor was served alcohol. As a result Florida International University enacted a month-long suspension of all fraternities and sororities on campus, while the administration reformed the policies concerning Greek Life.
