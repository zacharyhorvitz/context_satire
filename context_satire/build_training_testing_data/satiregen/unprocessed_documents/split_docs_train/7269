 Former FBI Director James Comey counts himself among the many people questioning why special counsel Robert Mueller did not make a determination on whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice. "I'm not prejudging it -- I'm just saying it doesn't make sense on its face, and so I have a lot of questions," Comey said in an interview that aired Wednesday on NBC's "Nightly News." He said he felt both Mueller and Attorney General William Barr "are entitled to the benefit of the doubt," but that he was surprised and confused by the choice. Mueller, Comey's predecessor as head of the FBI, was appointed to lead a special counsel investigation in the wake of Comey's firing, and a portion of the probe was dedicated to investigating if Trump had committed obstruction of justice.  President Donald Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday that unlike Trump, he did not think special counsel Robert Mueller had acted honorably during his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. "I would have to disagree with my client on that," Giuliani said on CNN's "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer." Giuliani suggested the reason for the difference in their assessments of Mueller could be that the former New York mayor was "in the trenches more" than Trump. Giuliani said he had a "mixed view" of Mueller's approach.  Donald Trump seems to think he is in the clear where the special counsel investigation is concerned. So why isn't he happier? Maybe because he already misses Robert Mueller. In his summation of the Mueller report findings, Attorney General William Barr said investigators did "not establish that the President was involved" in any crime related to Russian interference, and that there was insufficient evidence to support a prosecution of the President for obstruction of justice.
