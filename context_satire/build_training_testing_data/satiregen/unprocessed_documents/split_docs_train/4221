At InStyle Min created the InStyle Weddings and InStyle Makeover publications. As editor-in-chief at Us Weekly from 2002 to 2009, she was influential in creating popular culture trends and an industry for celebrity gossip. Min also created a more celebrity-friendly editorial style and placed more emphasis on reality TV stars. Min was appointed to lead The Hollywood Reporter in 2010 as part of a turnaround effort, as the publication was doing poorly. According to The New York Times, Min turned Us Weekly into one of the magazine industry's "major success stories". Public interest in celebrity news was growing, as was the magazine's circulation. In her role at Us Weekly, Min had a significant impact on popular culture and was influential in creating an industry for celebrity gossip. For example, Us Weekly was largely responsible for the popularity of the reality TV show about a couple with eight children, Jon & Kate Plus 8, after it featured John and Kate on the cover of eight sequential issues. In 2010, Beckman purchased THR from Guggenheim Partners and Pluribus Capital, and recruited Janice Min, the former editor-in-chief of Us Weekly, to "eviscerate" the existing daily trade paper and reinvent it as a glossy, large-format weekly magazine. The Hollywood Reporter relaunched with a weekly print edition and a revamped website that enabled it to break news. Eight months after its initial report, The New York Times took note of the many scoops THR had generated, adding that the new glossy format seemed to be succeeding with its "rarefied demographic", stating, "They managed to change the subject by going weekly... The large photos, lush paper stock and great design are a kind of narcotic here."
