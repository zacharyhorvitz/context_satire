 Ben Carson is calling on the five Republican presidential candidates to all gather and bury their hatchets before Thursday night's debate in Detroit. In a statement, Carson, a long-shot in a race dominated by Donald Trump, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, said that "this race has taken a turn for the worse, to the point of embarrassment on the world stage." He blamed the race's negativity -- which in recent days has featured Trump mocking Rubio's perspiration and Rubio joking about the size of Trump's fingers -- on the media. "If we are to defeat our Democratic opponent in the general election this November, we must reach an agreement together with each other that we will not succumb to the media's desire for a fight on the stage in Detroit," Carson said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.  Size matters. The GOP debate in Detroit Thursday night had been underway for just seven minutes when this point was made crystal clear. Republican debate turns dirty As the number of candidates still in the race has shrunk, tonight carried the promise of learning more about the remaining four. Instead, the personal insults began flying right away, most notably between Marco Rubio and Donald Trump.  On Thursday night, the five remaining Republican presidential candidates faced off at the CNN debate in Texas -- the final debate before Super Tuesday. As always, what was spoken was important, but body language really said it all. The ultimate Republican power couple -- former President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara -- made a cameo.
