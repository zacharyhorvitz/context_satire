Criticism of the game was primarily targeted towards the game's design, which reviewers felt followed too closely to the original arcade game. Stephen Poole of GameSpot argued that Hasbro " some of the old video game conventions unchanged" was "where Frogger disappoints" in his review of the PC version. The game's tendency to bring the player back to the starting point of the level once a frog was collected (as in the original) Poole complained "turned challenges into frustrations" because "you wind up covering the same ground over and over again", and ultimately concluded that "the 'new and improved' Frogger probably won't convert anyone who didn't care for the old one." A reviewer for Game Revolution agreed, arguing "the nature of the game with its time limits" makes it "impossible" to play a level for a lengthy amount of time before dying. Frogger: The Great Quest is a platform game released in 2001 by Konami for the PlayStation 2. It was ported to Microsoft Windows the following year and was dedicated in memory of its fallen voice actor, Steve Sheppard-Brodie, who was the voice of Lumpy the Toad, Count Blah the Vampire, and The Magical General of Light and Industry. It is the first game in the series developed by Konami, and the first since Hasbro Interactive released Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge in 2000. It introduced a new look, being the first in the series to be set in a 3-D platform environment. Frogger (branded and commonly referred to as Frogger: He's Back!) is an action video game remake of the classic 1981 arcade game of the same name. It was developed by SCE Cambridge Studio and published by Hasbro Interactive in November 1997. The game is an expansion of the original arcade game, sporting levels with large maps, an updated set of graphics rendered in 3D, and additional gameplay moves.
