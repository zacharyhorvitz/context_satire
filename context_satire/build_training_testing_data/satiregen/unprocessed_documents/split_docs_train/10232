 Four Americans were detained in Saudi Arabia last week on suspected terror offenses, bringing the total number of Americans in Saudi jails to nine, according to an online list of inmates posted by the Saudi Interior Ministry. Four U.S. citizens were detained January 25 and four others were detained in November and December, according to the site, which describes their cases as under investigation. A ninth American, imprisoned since 2007, was convicted, according to the ministry, which did not say what the conviction was for or the length of the sentence. The case is subject to appeal.  A Saudi Arabian court has overturned the death penalty for Palestinian poet Ashraf Fayadh, but upheld his guilty verdict on a charge of apostasy. The court, instead, sentenced Fayadh to eight years in prison and 800 lashes, a statement from his lawyer said. Fayadh was initially sentenced to death by a court in the southwestern Saudi city of Abha in November on a series of blasphemy charges related to his poetry, causing an international outcry. Fayadh will be lashed 800 times over 16 sessions, serve eight years in prison and must publicly declare his repentance in the media, said his lawyer Abdulrahman al-Lahim.  Thousands of Saudis may be forced to abandon their dream of studying overseas because of the oil price crash. With its budget under enormous pressure, Saudi Arabia is having to cut back the generous scholarship program that supported 200,000 students abroad in 2015. The government has been forced to tighten the rules of the $6 billion King Abdullah Scholarship Fund, limiting it to those attending one of the top 100 universities globally, or studying a program rated in the top 50 in its field. The government did not specify the scale of the cuts, but said the new conditions are part of its efforts to save money.
