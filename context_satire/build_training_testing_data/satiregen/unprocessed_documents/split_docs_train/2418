In an article for The Times published on 27 November 2012, he advocated a system of independent regulation, in place of the discredited system of self-regulation, and rejected statutory regulation of the press: "We must  in a way that keeps Parliament and the press apart." Harding also wrote: "The failure of News International to get to grips with what had happened at one of its newspapers suggested that the company had succumbed to that most dangerous delusion of the powerful, namely that it could play by its own set of rules." Coming from this corporate source, Roy Greenslade thought Harding's suggestion was a "significant innovation". He went with a friend to the theater building to wait as he auditioned for a show. While he waited the director asked him if he wanted to audition. He landed a role and from that moment on lived, ate and drank the theater. Over the next five years he went to every theater in Atlanta and auditioned for almost everything that came along. Harding left The Times at the end of 2012 after it had become apparent that he no longer had the support of Rupert Murdoch, or the board. It was reported in The Daily Telegraph that Murdoch had objected to the way The Times had covered the News International phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World, and also that Harding appeared to be an obstacle to the company's intention to merge the daily and Sunday titles into a seven-day operation. It was also reported at the time that Murdoch considered Harding an "ineffective manager".
