Historian Richard Wade has summarized the claims that scholars have made for the importance of the city in American history. The cities were the focal points for the growth of the West, especially those along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The cities, especially Boston, were the seed beds of the American Revolution. Rivalry between cities, such as between Baltimore and Philadelphia, or between Chicago and St. Louis, stimulated economic innovations and growth, especially regarding the railroads. East St. Louis is a city in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States within Greater St. Louis. It is located directly across the Mississippi River from Downtown St. Louis and the Gateway Arch National Park. East St. Louis is in what is defined as the Metro-East region of Southern Illinois. Once a bustling industrial center, like many cities in the Rust Belt, East St. Louis has been severely affected by loss of jobs due to industrial restructuring during the second half of the 20th century. The following is a partial list of United States cities and towns in which a majority (over 50%) of the population is Asian American or Asian, according to data from the 2010 Census for California and New Jersey and 2000 Census for other states. This list does not include cities in which, according to the 2000 Census and 2010 Census, merely a plurality (as opposed to a majority) of the residents are Asian American. The list below is organized by state and, within each state, by population size. The percentage of each city's population that is Asian American is listed in parentheses next to the city's name.
