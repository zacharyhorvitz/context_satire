In Time received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 36% of 163 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.2 out of 10. The website's consensus reads, "In Time's intriguing premise and appealing cast are easily overpowered by the blunt, heavy-handed storytelling." Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 53 based on 36 reviews. Many of the elements of In Time can be found in the 1987 short film The Price of Life, made by Chanticleer Films. Its basic premise and storyline are so similar that In Time has been called an unacknowledged remake of the earlier film. The Price of Life was a 38-minute short film (story by Stephen Tolkin and Michel Monteaux) in which a time account is physically linked to every infant at birth, with death automatic when the balance drops to zero. An elite upper-class is portrayed as living hundreds of years or more.  The Phoenix Saga in the X-Men comics of the 1970s is rightly considered a classic of the genre, which explains why filmmakers keep returning to it. Yet the hope for a truly definitive take on the story, "Dark Phoenix," proves a tepid addition to the "X-Men" cinematic series, while possessing just enough merit to prevent entirely going down in flames. Grading on a curve of recent X-Men movies, place "Dark Phoenix" well behind the "X-Men" editions subtitled "First Class" and "Days of Future Past" but ahead of "Apocalypse," the latter representing the nadir of the mutant heroes. Notably, "Phoenix" shares a weakness with that most recent film -- namely, an utterly mediocre villain.
