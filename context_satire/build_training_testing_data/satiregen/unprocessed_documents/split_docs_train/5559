Researchers at the Pew Research Center annually comb through publicly available sources of information and publications. Each annual report looks at events that took place about 18 months to two years before its publication. The Pew Research Center is  a nonpartisan American think tank (referring to itself as a "fact tank") based in Washington, D.C. It provides information on social issues, public opinion, and demographic trends shaping the United States and the world. It also conducts public opinion polling, demographic research, media content analysis, and other empirical social science research. The Pew Research Center does not take policy positions, and is a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts.  Secretary of State John Kerry made history last month by becoming the first sitting cabinet official to visit Hiroshima, where he paid his respects to the victims of the atomic bomb dropped by the United States on the Japanese city at the end of World War II. Kerry's visit was rich in symbolism, but the real question it triggered is whether President Obama will himself make a trip to Hiroshima when he travels to Japan in May. Now we have our answer. News reports indicate that Obama is indeed  planning such a trip.
