In 1997, writer Gilbert Ralston sued Warner Bros. over the upcoming feature film based on the series. Ralston helped create the original television series The Wild Wild West and scripted the pilot episode "The Night of the Inferno". In a deposition, Ralston explained that in 1964 he had been approached by producer Michael Garrison who "said he had an idea for a series, good commercial idea, and wanted to know if I could glue the idea of a western hero and a James Bond-type together in the same show". Ralston said he then created the Civil War characters, the format, the story outline and nine drafts of the script that was the basis for the television series.  The routine fast-food transactions at a Syracuse, New York, drive-through are a lot warmer these days. Taco Bell customers are getting hand-written notes along with their burritos and gorditas, simply because one worker there, Kelly Stewart, is tired of hearing about bad news in the world. For the past month and a half of this harsh winter, the 27-year-old has been writing inspirational messages. She hands the notes out with customer meals at the drive-thru and the front counter. In 2017, media outlets reported that Ryckert married Bianca Mondo after winning a Taco Bell competition, the Love and Tacos contest, to become the first couple to be married at the fast-food restaurant chain's new in-house wedding chapel in its Las Vegas flagship Taco Bell Cantina. Both are said to be fans of Taco Bell, with Ryckert noted as once spending 90 dollars ordering everything off of the Taco Bell menu. Listeners of The Giant Beastcast informed Ryckert of the competition which had entrants submitting their entries via social media. Ryckert learned that he had won while in Orlando, Florida for WrestleMania 33.
