A Grammy Award (stylized as GRAMMY, originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an award presented by The Recording Academy to recognize achievements in the music industry. The trophy depicts a gilded gramophone. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. The Grammys are the second of the Big Three major music awards held annually (between the American Music Awards in the Fall, and the Billboard Music Awards in the Summer).  Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, the two surviving members of the Beatles, will get back together to play the star-studded "The Night That Changed America: A Grammys Salute to The Beatles," Starr said Monday. "To celebrate the 50 years since we landed in New York in February (1964), they're putting on a big show on Monday and we'll be doing it there," he told "Access Hollywood" on Monday at a David Lynch Foundation event. Starr was being honored by the Lynch Foundation with its Lifetime of Peace and Love Award. The Recording Academy, which oversees the Grammy Awards, had already said that McCartney and Starr would both be performing at the Grammys Sunday night -- though the question of whether they'll be performing together is still unconfirmed.  One of the more intriguing pop controversies of 2013 was the friendly fire exchanged over the perceived similarities between Katy Perry's "Roar" and Sara Bareilles' "Brave." This Sunday's Grammy Awards just might bring some resolution to that argument â€” or at least declare a "winner": Both tracks are nominated for best pop solo performance, alongside Bruno Mars' "When I Was Your Man," Justin Timberlake's "Mirrors," and Lorde's "Royals." If Sunday represents an end to the controversy, that will suit Bareilles just fine. "I was surprised and to be honest disappointed at how vicious people were," Bareilles tells EW.
