Keller was born and raised in Albuquerque, with his two siblings. His father was a founder of Union Savings Bank and his mother was a public school teacher and homemaker. He was raised as a Roman Catholic and following his graduation from Saint Pius X High School, he attended the University of Notre Dame. Growing up Keller struggled with dyslexia, though he did not discover he suffered from the learning disability until he was in graduate school. Keller played quarterback for the Duke City Gladiators for their 2018 season opener. A heavy metal enthusiast, Keller was profiled as the “#MetalMayor” by the New York Times; on a podcast with Robb Flynn, he named Chaos A.D. by Sepultura as his favourite album of all time. Tim is also an advocate for Dyslexia awareness after being diagnosed and re-learning various reading and processing skills as an adult. He lives in Albuquerque with his wife Liz and their two children, Jack and Maya. In January 2017 Keller announced his intention to run in that year's Albuquerque mayoral election to fight for a safe, inclusive and innovative city. He stated that he would pursue public financing for his campaign by initially raising thousands of five-dollar donations, and pledged to expand the city's Police Department from around 850 officers to 1,200 if elected. Of the final eight candidates to make the Mayoral ballot, Keller was the only one to receive public financing, collecting nearly 6,000 five-dollar donations from the community, an impressive organizing feat. Keller would receive roughly $380,000 from the city to run his campaign, while his opponents would have no cap to the amount of money they could raise.
