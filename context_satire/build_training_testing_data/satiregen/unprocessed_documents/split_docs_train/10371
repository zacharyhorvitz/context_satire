 The East Coast is on edge. Hurricane Joaquin is the reason why. On Thursday, it lashed the Bahamas as a Category 4 storm with 130 mph winds. It's what is expected to come next that has the United States worried: a stronger storm and a sharp turn north.  A deluge roared over the East Coast on Saturday, causing blackouts and evacuations and threatening all-time rainfall records in South Carolina and the southern Appalachians. Three people died on Friday and Saturday in traffic incidents in South Carolina, and a car passenger died in North Carolina on Thursday when a tree fell on Interstate 95, officials said. The deaths were blamed on the weather. The potentially historic precipitation will last all 48 hours of the weekend, due to a 1-2 punch from Hurricane Joaquin over the open Atlantic and a second weather system: Joaquin drenches the Northeast and a separate low-pressure rainmaker dumps on the Southeast.  Joaquin strengthened into a major hurricane on Wednesday night, the U.S. National Hurricane Center announced. The Category 3 storm is poised to pound the Bahamas with heavy rain and dangerous storm surges. And the storm's movement later this week could have flooding implications for an already drenched eastern United States. While forecasters are having a hard time figuring where Joaquin is headed, they believe the storm will continue to strengthen over the next day or so.
