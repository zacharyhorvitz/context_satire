 Jeb Bush's New Hampshire strategy is working out fine -- just not for him. But for John Kasich, it's a different story. The Ohio governor is on the rise, adopting elements of the Bush playbook and threatening to elbow his rival out of the role of establishment conservative with genuine general election appeal. Should he build on a fast start in the Granite State and improve his so far limited appeal elsewhere, it's becoming clear that Kasich could emerge as a viable rival to Bush for the affections of the GOP elites.  Let the air wars begin. Right to Rise, the super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's presidential campaign, is laying down $24 million for an ad buy that begins Tuesday in Iowa and New Hampshire, according to a source familiar with buy. The major purchase comes as the political arm of the outside group Club for Growth announced ads taking on Donald Trump's record on fiscal issues.  Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Friday embraced his last name more than he has at any point in his presidential campaign to date -- saying he is a Bush, and that's why he'd be a good leader on foreign policy. Speaking at the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference in Michigan, Bush got into a riff attacking Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. "Name a country in the world where our relationship is better today than the day that Hillary of Clinton became secretary of state," Bush instructed the crowd.
