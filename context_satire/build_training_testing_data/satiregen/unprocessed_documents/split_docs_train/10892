The Lesser-Known Candidates Forum is a quadrennial event during the United States presidential election season that takes place at the St. Anselm College New Hampshire Institute of Politics since 1972. Occurring prior to the New Hampshire primary, it allows for lesser-known presidential candidates of the Democratic and Republican parties to voice their political positions. Since the 1950s, the college has played an important role in the "first in the nation" New Hampshire primary, and has served as the national stage for many future presidents, candidates, and supporters. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon each delivered important policy speeches there. The college has also been home to several national presidential debates which have attracted extensive media attention. Marc Ambinder, political editor of The Atlantic, described the role Saint Anselm plays in national politics by saying, "no one runs for president without speaking at St. A's New Hampshire Institute of Politics." U.S. News & World Report also ranked the college as the single, most popular location in New Hampshire for presidential candidates to visit. For over the past forty years, the New Hampshire Institute of Politics (NHIOP) has played host to hundreds of presidential aspirants that have delivered policy speeches at Saint Anselm College. It was founded on the basis that "educated and engaged citizens are vital for a healthy democracy."
