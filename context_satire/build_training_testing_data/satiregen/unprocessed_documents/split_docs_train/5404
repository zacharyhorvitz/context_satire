Graham has never been married and has no children. He helped to raise his sister, Darline Graham Nordone, after the deaths of his mother and father, which occurred within fifteen months of each other, leaving the two without parents when Graham was 22 and she was 13. Experiencing the early deaths of his parents, Graham says, made him mature more quickly, and Nordone, who introduced her brother at his formal announcement of his candidacy for the 2016 presidential race, said she hoped to be with him on the campaign trail frequently to show voters his softer side. "He's kind of like a brother, a father and a mother rolled into one," she said.  Sen. Lindsey Graham says Donald Trump is a "complete idiot" and if the two face off in the Republican primary in Graham's home state of South Carolina, "I'll beat his brains out." Graham, the South Carolina senator, attacked Trump in a Tuesday morning interview on CNN. Trump had taunted Graham earlier in the day, highlighting a poll of South Carolina GOP primary voters that showed the real estate mogul leading the pack with 30% support and Graham much further back at 4%. "Congrats," Trump sarcastically tweeted at Graham, noting that those four percentage points are "far better than zero nationally."  Donald Trump must rule out a third-party bid before October if he wants to compete in South Carolina's Republican primary, a crucial test in the nominating contest. Trump has repeatedly refused to rule out a third-party candidacy, noting that he could use the threat of an independent bid as leverage, but he cannot appear on the South Carolina primary ballot unless he pledges to support the GOP nominee in the general election. Trump said Tuesday when asked about the rule by reporters in Iowa that his campaign is "looking into it." "We certainly have plenty of time," he said.
