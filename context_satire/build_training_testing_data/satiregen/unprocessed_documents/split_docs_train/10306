 Hours of searching mountainous terrain on foot and from the air have so far failed to locate a U.S. military helicopter that went missing in Nepal as it helped with relief efforts in the earthquake-ravaged nation. The UH-1 Huey helicopter had six U.S. Marines and two Nepali service members aboard when it lost contact Tuesday evening, Pentagon officials said. Radio transmissions indicated its crew was having some type of fuel problem before it went missing near Charikot, an area roughly 45 miles east of Kathmandu, the capital, the Pentagon has said. The helicopter was assisting with disaster relief in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that struck the Himalayan nation on April 25, killing thousands of people. The hijackers crashed the aircraft into the western side of the Pentagon at 09:37 EDT. Many people witnessed the crash, and news sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact severely damaged an area of the Pentagon and caused a large fire. A portion of the building collapsed; firefighters spent days working to fully extinguish the blaze.  A U.S. military helicopter with eight people on board has gone missing in Nepal as Marine personnel worked to help people in the earthquake-ravaged country. Americans and Nepalis are searching for the Marine helicopter that lost contact Tuesday evening near Charikot, an area roughly 45 miles east of Kathmandu, the capital, Pentagon officials said. The UH-1 Huey helicopter had six U.S. Marines and two Nepalis aboard at the time, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said. Radio transmissions indicated its crew was having some type of fuel problem before it went missing, said Warren, who added the U.S. government is "hopeful" the aircraft didn't crash but doesn't know.
