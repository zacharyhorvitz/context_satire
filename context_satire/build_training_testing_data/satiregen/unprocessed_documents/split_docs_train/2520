In response to claims leveled at SeaWorld and other marine parks by the movie The Cove which accuses them of obtaining dolphins taken in drive hunts, SeaWorld spokesperson Fred Jacobs stated that, "We think we're being unfairly criticized for something we're opposed to." It is illegal to bring drive hunt animals into the United States. He adds that, "SeaWorld opposes the dolphin hunts documented in The Cove. We do not purchase any animals from these hunts.  The "Blackfish" controversy that torpedoed SeaWorld's Orlando concert series has now sunk some shows at Busch Gardens Tampa. "We regret to announce that the Beach Boys and Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo have canceled their performances at Bands, Brew & BBQ this year, but we respect their decision," a Busch Gardens Tampa spokesman said Thursday. "We're disappointed that there is a media controversy enacted by animal activists and based on misinformation." Busch Gardens Tampa is owned by SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment, which has been targeted by animal rights activists since the airing of the documentary "Blackfish" on CNN last October. In 2013, SeaWorld's treatment of killer whales in captivity was the basis of the movie Blackfish, which documents the history of Tilikum, a killer whale captured by SeaLand of the Pacific, later transported to SeaWorld Orlando who has been involved in the deaths of three people. In the aftermath of the release of the film, Martina McBride, 38 Special, REO Speedwagon, Cheap Trick, Heart, Barenaked Ladies, Trisha Yearwood and Willie Nelson canceled scheduled concerts at SeaWorld parks. SeaWorld disputes the accuracy of the film, calling it “propaganda” and “emotionally manipulative”. It has spent $15 million on an advertising campaign countering the allegations and emphasizing its contributions to the study of whales and their conservation.
