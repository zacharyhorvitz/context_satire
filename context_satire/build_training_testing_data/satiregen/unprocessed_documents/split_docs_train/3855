 At the Democratic National Convention Tuesday, San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro was the first Latino ever to give the keynote speech at the convention. He's a rising star in the Democratic Party, and his speech hit Mitt Romney as hard as a man of privilege who doesn't understand the struggles of average Americans. He was introduced by his identical twin brother, Texas state representative and U.S. Congressional candidate, Joaquin Castro. Both Castros talk to Soledad O'Brien on "Starting Point" this morning about the importance of the Latino vote.  A young rising star. A keynote speech on the Democratic Party's biggest stage. Is it 2004 again? San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro gave the most significant speech of his political career on Tuesday night when he became the first Latino to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention.  Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is behind enemy lines tonight. The co-chair of the Obama Campaign and chairman of the Democratic National Convention is on hand at the Republican National Convention to rebut the message from the GOP. He talks with John Berman about his role at the convention in the midst of Tropical Storm Isaac. Villaraigosa says he’s in Tampa to challenge the Republican platform “in a way that is respectful of the other party.”  “We’re to compare and contrast, but we’re also here together, working together, to make sure that people are safe," he says.
