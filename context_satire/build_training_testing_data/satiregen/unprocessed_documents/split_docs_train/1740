The local police contacted the Portland Police task force investigating the kidnapping and murder of Lee Iseli. Dodd was brought to the Camas Police station, where the Portland task force lead detectives C.W. Jensen and Dave Trimble interviewed him. He was then taken to the Clark County jail in Vancouver where Jensen and Trimble continued their interrogation over the course of three days. The boyfriend of the boy's mother, William "Ray" Graves, came to the theater lobby and was told that the boy had nearly been abducted. Graves went outside the theater in the direction where Dodd was last seen. Dodd's car had broken down a short distance away from the theater and he was attempting to start the motor. In order not to raise Dodd's suspicion and to stall for time, Graves offered to help him. At the age of 13, Dodd began exposing himself to children in his neighborhood. His father eventually told an Oregon newspaper that he was aware of the boy's behavior but largely ignored it, since he felt his son was otherwise "a well-behaved child who never had problems with drugs, drinking, or smoking." By the time he entered high school, Dodd had progressed to molestation, beginning with his younger cousins, and then neighborhood children he offered to babysit, as well as the children of a woman his father was dating. At the age of 15, Dodd was arrested for indecent exposure, but police released him with a recommendation of juvenile counseling.
