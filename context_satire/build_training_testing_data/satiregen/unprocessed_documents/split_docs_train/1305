True Bruin Welcome begins the fall quarter to introduce new students to clubs and activities. The week includes the Day of Service for all freshmen, the Enormous Activities Fair, and the Sports Fair. At the end of move-in and the beginning of True Bruin Welcome, UCLA holds Bruin Bash, which includes a concert, dance and movie pre-release. Bruin Bash was created as a replacement for Black Sunday, a large-scale day of partying including all fraternities in North Westwood Village. California and UCLA have met annually on the football field since 1939. Because UCLA was founded as the southern branch of the University of California, the series takes on the quality of a sibling rivalry. The series was dominated early by Cal, followed by dominance by UCLA in the 1950s until 80s, and has become more evenly matched recently.  The White House kicked off "Made in America Week" on Monday and it didn't take long for the administration to come under fire for criticism that products made by President Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump's eponymous brands are made elsewhere. The first daughter, who serves as a White House adviser, took a formal leave of absence from the brand in January, but kept her ownership stake and moved the assets into a trust. The President transferred his business holdings into a trust run by his sons, and did not sell his stake. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that while President Donald Trump is looking to create an environment to make more products domestically through tax and regulatory reform, he conceded that "Made in America" may not be achievable for all industries.
