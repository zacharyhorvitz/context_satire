Partners for Healthy Pets (PHP) was founded by AAHA and the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) to address the widespread decline in preventive care visits to the veterinarian. The group is composed of more than 20 leading veterinary associations and animal health companies and is committed to combating the increasing prevalence of serious diseases and the declining health of pets. Research has shown that even though the pet population is increasing, visits to veterinary hospitals have declined every year for nearly a decade. Partners for Healthy Pets works to ensure that pets receive the preventive healthcare they deserve through regular visits to a veterinarian. The revenue by the nonprofit was $147M in 2013 and in that fiscal year , it paid its CEO more than $1M. Hospitals pay the Joint Commission up to $37,000 in fees annually to maintain their accreditation status. Inspections cost approximately $18,000 every three years. These costs are shadowed by the ties of the Joint Commission to industry. The AMA has also supported changes in medical malpractice law to limit damage awards, which, it contends, makes it difficult for patients to find appropriate medical care. In many states, high risk specialists have moved to other states that have enacted reform. For example, in 2004, all neurosurgeons had relocated out of the entire southern half of Illinois. The main legislative emphasis in multiple states has been to effect caps on the amount that patients can receive for pain and suffering.
