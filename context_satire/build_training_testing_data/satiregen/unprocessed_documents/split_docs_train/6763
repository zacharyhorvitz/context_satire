Francis chose not to live in the official papal residence in the Apostolic Palace, but to remain in the Vatican guest house, in a suite in which he can receive visitors and hold meetings. He is the first pope since Pope Pius X to live outside the papal apartments. Francis still appears at the window of the Apostolic Palace for the Sunday Angelus. At his first audience on 16 March 2013, Pope Francis told journalists that he had chosen the name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, and had done so because he was especially concerned for the well-being of the poor. He explained that, as it was becoming clear during the conclave voting that he would be elected the new bishop of Rome, the Brazilian Cardinal Cláudio Hummes had embraced him and whispered, "Don't forget the poor", which had made Bergoglio think of the saint. Bergoglio had previously expressed his admiration for St. Francis, explaining that “He brought to Christianity an idea of poverty against the luxury, pride, vanity of the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the time. He changed history." Many such choices of Francis have drawn notice in the press: his choice of living in the Vatican guesthouse rather than in the Apostolic Palace, his standing, rather than sitting in the papal throne, while receiving the accustomed congratulations from his fellow cardinals, no pontifical gold pectoral cross but the one he used in Argentina, saying a simple "good evening" before his first papal Urbi et Orbi message ("to the city and world"), riding home to Casa Santa Marta not in the papal limousine but with his fellow bishops and cardinals in the last minibus, and emphasizing that his fundamental role is to be Bishop of Rome.
