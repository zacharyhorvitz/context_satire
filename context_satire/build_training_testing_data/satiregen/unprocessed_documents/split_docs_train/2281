Grepper was a product developer from Portland, Oregon. He first tried to raise funding for the product in November 2013 but fell short of the $125,000 goal and failed to secure any funding. He launched a second campaign on July 8, 2014, and critics attribute the success of the second Kickstarter campaign to the timing. The Coolest received extensive press coverage when it topped the funding goals of the Pebble watch, and ended the campaign in August with $13,285,226 and 62,642 backers making it the most funded Kickstarter campaign of 2014. Igarashi conceived the game after his departure from Konami in 2014, prompted by numerous fan requests for him to make another Metroidvania-type game. He used the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to demonstrate to potential funding agencies of the demand for the game in 2015, which successfully raised more than US$5.5 million from backers, making it one of the most funded video game campaigns on the platform. A retro-style companion game, Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon, was developed by Inti Creates and released in May 2018. The Coolest Cooler was a multi-function cooler that was initially funded through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter. Currently, it is one of the largest disasters in Kickstarter history. In the summer of 2014, Ryan Grepper raised over $13 million, making it the most funded Kickstarter campaign of 2014. Crowdfunders were offered the product at a discounted rate but there are still problems with orders being fulfilled.
