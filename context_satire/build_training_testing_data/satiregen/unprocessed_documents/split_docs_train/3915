 Two signs of the times: another mass shooting and more Twitter outrage. This time, though, the barbs over social media came from the medical community in response to a tweet from the National Rifle Association. The piling-on began after the NRA tweeted on Wednesday a link to an article from its Institute of Legislative Action. The article, titled "Surprise: Physician Group Rehashes Same Tired Gun Control Policies," was promoted with these words: "Someone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane. In 2006, the NSRA founded the National Association of Target Shooting Sports working group in association with the National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom and Clay Pigeon Shooting Association, to explore the practicalities and benefits of a merger between the bodies.
