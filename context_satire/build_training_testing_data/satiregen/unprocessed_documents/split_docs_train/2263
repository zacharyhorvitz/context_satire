 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are now in a tight race in Virginia, with voters largely disappointed in both candidates, according to a new poll released Thursday. The survey from the University of Mary Washington's Center for Leadership and Media Studies found Clinton with 40% support among likely voters in the commonwealth, while Trump trailed with 37%, within the poll's margin of error. Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson garnered 8%, comparable to where he has been polling nationally. Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin has 3% and Green Party candidate Jill Stein has 1%. Although Johnson had focused the majority of his campaign activities on the New Hampshire primary, he announced on November 29, 2011 that he would no longer campaign there due to his inability to gain traction with less than a month until the primary. There was speculation in the media that he might run as a Libertarian Party candidate instead. Johnson acknowledged that he was considering such a move. In December, Politico reported that Johnson would quit the Republican primaries and announce his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination at a December 28 press conference.  Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is leading Republican nominee Donald Trump by two points with likely voters in the most recent CNN Poll of Polls released Thursday. The analysis shows Clinton has 43% of support from likely voters, Trump had 41% support, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson had 9% and Green Party candidate Jill Stein had 3%. The Poll of Polls averages results from the five most recent publicly released national polls that meets CNN's standards for publication. All of the polls included the four-way match-ups with the third party candidates.
