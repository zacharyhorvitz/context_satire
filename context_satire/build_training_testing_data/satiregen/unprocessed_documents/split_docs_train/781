On November 16, 2015, six days before Survivor Series, Reid's sister WWE Divas Champion Charlotte signed a contract to face Paige at the event. Charlotte proclaimed she was doing this for Reid as a tribute to him. Paige then mocked her by saying that "Your little baby brother, he didn't have much fight in him, did he?" It was later revealed that WWE did not ask permission from the Flair family to reference Reid's death, and had given no prior warning to his parents. Reid was born in St. Louis, Missouri, into a show business family. His mother, Bertha Westbrook (1868–1939), was an actress and his father, James Halleck "Hal" Reid (1862–1920), worked successfully in a variety of theatrical jobs, mainly as playwright and actor, traveling the country. As a boy, Wallace Reid was performing on stage at an early age, but acting was put on hold while he obtained an education at Freehold Military School in Freehold Township, New Jersey. Reid graduated from Perkiomen Seminary in Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1909. Reid was born in Searchlight, Nevada, the third of four sons of the Harry Vincent Reid, a rock miner, and Inez Orena (Jaynes) Reid, a laundress. At the time, Searchlight was a small impoverished town. His father committed suicide in 1972 when he was 58; Harry was 32 years old. His paternal grandmother was an English immigrant from Darlaston, Staffordshire.
