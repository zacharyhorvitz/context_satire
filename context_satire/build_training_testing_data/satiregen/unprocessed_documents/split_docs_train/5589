Albert Arnold Gore Sr. (December 26, 1907 – December 5, 1998), known to some as Al Gore before the fame of his son, was an American politician who served as a U.S. Representative and a U.S. Senator for the Democratic Party from Tennessee. He was the father of Albert A. Gore Jr., the 45th Vice President of the United States (1993–2001). Al Gore is a United States politician and environmentalist. He is the former Vice President of the United States (1993–2001), the 2000 Democratic Party presidential nominee, and the co-recipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He has been involved with the environmental activist movement for a number of decades, and has had full participation since he left the vice-presidency in 2001. Gore would later poke fun at the controversy on the Late Show with David Letterman when he read Letterman's Top 10 List, which for this show was called, "Top Ten Rejected Gore - Lieberman Campaign Slogans." Number nine on the list was: "Remember, America, I gave you the Internet, and I can take it away!" A few years later, on June 6, 2005, Gore was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award "for three decades of contributions to the Internet" at the Webby Awards.
