 Sen. Marco Rubio is firing back at Donald Trump as "insecure" and "touchy" after the mogul has spent the past two days going after his Republican presidential opponent. Trump slammed the Florida senator during an interview Thursday with CNN, calling the 44-year-old just a "kid." It followed a lengthy attack on Rubio that Trump delivered the previous day in South Carolina. Later on Thursday, Rubio told a Kentucky sports radio station that Trump lashes out at his opponents when his front-runner status appears in jeopardy.  Marco Rubio has missed more votes than virtually any other senator this year. He has avoided the back-and-forth shouting matches with Donald Trump and other fellow Republican presidential nominees. And he hasn't made a splash with major campaign rallies that fill arenas. Yet he is now in the top tier of candidates, according to the most recent CNN/ORC poll.  Sen. Marco Rubio says he wants no part of Donald Trump's "freak show," as the Republican presidential hopeful continues to throw jabs at the front-runner. The two candidates have battled through sound bites for the past week, after essentially staying muted on each other for most of the campaign. As Rubio has enjoyed a marked boost in the polls since his performance in the second debate, Trump has gone after Rubio with insults including calling him a "kid" and dinging his voting record this year. The Florida senator has willingly dished it back at Trump, calling him unserious and "touchy."
