 A new administration in Washington is something like a new high school freshman class. They arrive full of energy and ambition, but in a short time the system reveals who is who, and the sorting begins. In the case of the Trump administration, the "troublemaking" kids -- Stephen Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, Michael Flynn and others -- formed a clique with the President that made life hard for everyone, including him. But now they are gone, and he has found new friends named Sen. Charles "Chuck" Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who may help him to apply himself to the work at hand.  White House chief of staff John Kelly has been omnipresent during President Donald Trump's first appearance at the United Nations General Assembly this week, a multiple-day foray into the complicated world of international politics. Two months into his job, Kelly spent this week escorting Trump through the maze of halls and navigating the sea of diplomats seeking to chat, even looking on during the President's first UN speech. In a White House where proximity is power, Kelly's public positioning speaks volumes. The message has already been heard back in Washington.  For a few minutes on Thursday morning it appeared that Donald Trump -- the man who launched his presidential campaign by deriding immigrants and bathed in chants of "build the wall" at campaign rallies -- was open to a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States. Then the President spoke for himself. In a series of statements to reporters on Thursday, the White House appeared to be debating itself over what the President would agree to on immigration reform, whether any deal hinged on funding for a wall along the US-Mexico border and what exactly constituted amnesty. Trump kicked off the internal -- yet public -- debate as he left the White House for a trip to Florida to inspect damage wrought by Hurricane Irma.
