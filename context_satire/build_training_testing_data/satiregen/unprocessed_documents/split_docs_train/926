 Amazon's latest service wants you to feel comfortable letting delivery people into your home to drop off your packages. The concept may sound a bit alarming, but the company says the service, called  Amazon Key, for Amazon Prime members, is not only convenient but secure. Amazon Key is a two-part service with the Cloud Cam security camera and a compatible door lock. Users can let Amazon couriers into their homes while they are away and can keep watch through an app to make sure the drivers don't do anything besides deliver a package and leave.  Alexa, is it a good idea to let strangers into my house? Amazon thinks so. The company says it has a safe way for you to allow delivery drivers inside your home, even when you're not there. The service is called Amazon Key and launches November 8 for Prime members. On July 15, 2015, in honor of the website's 20th anniversary, Amazon first held Prime Day. The event features a large number of sales and promotions that are exclusively available to Amazon Prime subscribers, with Amazon promoting that the first edition would feature "more deals than Black Friday". The inaugural Prime Day faced criticism over the quality of the discounts offered, with many of them being tied to items not in high demand. Some users jokingly described the event as a "yard sale", and Walmart also countered the event with a promotional blog post arguing that customers "shouldn't have to pay $100 to find great deals".
