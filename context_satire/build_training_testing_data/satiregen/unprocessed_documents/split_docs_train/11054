 (CNN) -- An Army veteran who neighbors say played in a far right punk band was the lone shooter in the rampage at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that killed six people and wounded four, according to information from law enforcement authorities. Wade Michael Page, 40, was shot to death by police responding to the Sunday morning attack in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek, the community's chief of police told reporters Monday.

One of the heroes on Sunday was the president of the temple Satwant Kaleka, who passed away after trying to tackle the gunman and getting shot.
