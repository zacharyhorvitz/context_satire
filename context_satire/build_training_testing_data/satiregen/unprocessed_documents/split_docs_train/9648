Contagious and infectious diseases have been largely overcome, and the average length of life of man has increased to fifty-eight years. The great causes of death in middle and later life are diseases of heart, blood vessels and kidneys, diseases of the nervous system, and cancer. The progress that is being made would suggest that within the measure of time for this forecast the average life time of civilized man would be raised to the biblical term of three-score and ten. The three main buildings at the site are the Davis Building, the Mayo Building (including the hospital) and the Cannaday Building. They are connected to two hotels, The Inn at Mayo Clinic and Marriott’s Courtyard Jacksonville Mayo Clinic/Beaches. Laboratory research is also conducted on Mayo’s campus. Mayo’s research is focused on cancer, neurological and neuro-degenerative diseases.  We've all been there: After struggling over a problem for hours, we rest our eyes for a few minutes and suddenly the answer is lying before us, clear as day. This common phenomenon has contributed to the idea of the so-called power nap, a quick snatch of rest that stops short of deep sleep yet somehow manages to refresh and stimulate. Although there is much about the power nap that remains a mystery, researchers have begun to uncover the brain processes behind the little miracles it produces. The latest research, presented Wednesday at an annual meeting of neuroscientists, may help explain the mental spark that sometimes occurs during a nap.
