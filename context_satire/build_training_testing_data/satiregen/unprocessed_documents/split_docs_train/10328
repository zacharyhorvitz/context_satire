In a February 2010 interview, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie called the show "negative for New Jersey" because most of the cast members are not from the state. According to Christie, the program "takes a bunch of New Yorkers and drops them at the Jersey Shore and tries to make America feel like this is the real New Jersey". Governor Christie took action against the series by trying to encourage people to experience the real Jersey Shore for themselves rather than watch it through MTV: "I can tell people: They want to know what New Jersey really is? I welcome them to come to New Jersey any time." The show became a pop culture phenomenon, with classes and conferences at universities about the show, and journalists listing it as one of the most notable shows of the time. The Shore franchise spawned several international adaptations in other countries. Four of the Jersey Shore cast members received spin-off shows on MTV, with the most successful being Snooki & JWOWW . Most of the cast would go on to appear in other reality programs or receive their own shows on various networks. Marybeth Hicks, author of the parenting book Bringing Up Geeks, criticized Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi for stating she would change the world by installing tanning beds in every person's house during her appearance on The Jay Leno Show. Hicks has believed Polizzi could influence tweens into using tanning beds. "It's disconcerting that  could have any sort of influence or be a role model ... or advocate something like tanning beds that could cause cancer," she said. Hicks also criticized MTV for glorifying behaviors that she claims are dangerous, such as drinking and casual sex, for the purpose of garnering higher ratings, and believed that parents are to possess knowledge of that the show has been promoting unsafe behavior.
