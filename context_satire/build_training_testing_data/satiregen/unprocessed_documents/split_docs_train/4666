 Senators couldn't muster enough bipartisan support to pass a series of gun control measures Monday, the latest in a long string of failed attempts at enacting tighter curbs on firearms in the United States. Spurred by the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, senators from each party introduced the measures they said would have strengthened background checks and prevented suspected terrorists from obtaining weapons. But tough election year politics, paired with disputes over the effectiveness of each party's ideas, proved too powerful to break the longstanding partisan gridlock that's surrounded gun issues for years. The result was expected.  Kim Kardashian on Tuesday slammed the Senate for failing to pass gun control measures following last week's mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. "The fact that anyone can so easily access guns is so scary & after all of the devastating loss the Senate should have not failed us!!!" the reality TV star tweeted. After renewed calls for action to curb the availability of firearms from Democratic and some Republican senators last week, all four proposed gun control measures failed to pass the Senate Monday night.  Women may soon be required to register for the military draft. The Senate overwhelmingly passed a $602 billion defense bill Tuesday that included an amendment that would require women to register for the draft -- also known as the selective service -- for the first time in history. The National Defense Authorization Act passed 85-13, although some Republican senators protested against the inclusion of the provision pertaining to women and the draft. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, slammed the measure last week during a Senate session, calling it "a radical departure" from American history.
