Toys "R" Us announced that Brandon would succeed Antonio Urcelay as CEO on June 2, 2015. Brandon was chosen for his track record of leading two private companies to their IPOs. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Brandon acknowledged that the owners of Toys R Us (Bain Capital and Vornado Realty Trust) would seek to exit the business, but emphasized the necessity of improving the company's performance: "The focus now is on execution, performance and growth. … The company needs to put itself in a position where it can compete globally."  Linda Kaplan Thaler wasn't entirely sure how her Toys "R" Us jingle would go over at first. It was the early 1980s and she was a junior copywriter at the J. Walter Thompson ad agency, which was tasked with inventing a catchy tune for the toy company. The song that Thaler whipped up used a slogan — "I'm a Toys 'R' Us Kid" — co-created by James Patterson, the future crime novelist who at the time was a colleague of hers. "I didn't know if it was good enough," Thaler said.  Toys "R" Us is closing its doors after 70 years in business. It marks the end for a company that sold toys, bikes, video games and birthday presents to millions of American kids. For half a century, Geoffrey the mascot giraffe invited children to its giant playhouses. Legions of adults who came of age in the 1980s and 1990s can probably still whistle the jingle: "I'm a Toys 'R' Us kid."
