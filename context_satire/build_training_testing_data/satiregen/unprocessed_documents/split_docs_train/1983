 Jill Biden is taking on Democratic criticism of her husband, particularly Bernie Sanders' recent comments that the former vice president has too much "baggage" in his political record that he argues makes it difficult to generate excitement and energy needed to defeat President Donald Trump. "That's ridiculous," Biden told CNN when asked about Sanders' comments during an extensive interview with CNN on a two-day swing through New Hampshire. "Joe has been under attack because he's doing so well. And I don't like it that Democrats attack other Democrats.  Less than four weeks from the Iowa caucuses, former Vice President Joe Biden in many ways appears to be in a stronger position now than he was when he entered the 2020 presidential race. Biden has defied perceptions that he is a weak front-runner, retaining his strength with non-white voters and ranking consistently as the candidate likely voters believe has the best chance to defeat President Donald Trump. Predictions that his age, penchant for gaffes and lengthy record would be his undoing have not come true. Now, a confluence of events in the lead-up to the first primary votes being cast are playing to Biden's strengths. Biden chose veteran Democratic lawyer and aide Ron Klain to be his chief of staff, and Time Washington bureau chief Jay Carney to be his director of communications. Biden intended to eliminate some of the explicit roles assumed by the vice presidency of his predecessor, Dick Cheney, who had established himself as an autonomous power center. Otherwise, Biden said he would not emulate any previous vice presidency, but would instead seek to provide advice and counsel on every critical decision Obama would make. Biden said he was closely involved in all the cabinet appointments that were made during the transition.
