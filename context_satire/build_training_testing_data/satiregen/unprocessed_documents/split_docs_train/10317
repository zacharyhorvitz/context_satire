Lindblad strived to bring legitimacy to Swedish music and succeeded in doing so, even though his music was often criticized by the Swedish press for being too harmonically bold. It was not until Ludwig Spohr of Kassel praised Lindblad that the Swedish critics started to appreciate Lindblad. Towards the end of his life, he abstained from composing large works, and spent much of his time composing for friends and fellow musicians who shared a “contemporary Swedish taste.” He died at the age of 77 in Linköping on August 23, 1878. Lindblad's collaborative relationship with Jenny Lind brought many triumphs. For instance, Lindblad brought Jenny Lind to meet the famous opera composer, Giacomo Meyerbeer, while she was studying voice in Paris, precipitating her rise in popularity in Germany and Britain. Lindblad also introduced Lind to Mendelssohn. The fondness of Lindblad and Lind for each other gradually became romantic; and eventually Lindblad's wife Sophie offered to leave him so that he could marry Lind. Forever (stylised as FOREVER) is the debut studio album by Swedish DJ and record producer Alesso. It was released on 22 May 2015 by Def Jam Recordings. Alesso has said of the album, "It's been an indescribable journey to get this album together. I'm so proud of it, it's very personal to me, it's a dream to me that this has come together and I do what I love every single day.
