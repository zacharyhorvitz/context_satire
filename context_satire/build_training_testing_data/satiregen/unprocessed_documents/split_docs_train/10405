John has said that he took risks with unprotected sex during the 1980s and considers himself lucky to have avoided contracting HIV. In 1986, he joined with Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight and Stevie Wonder to record the single "That's What Friends Are For", with profits donated to the American Foundation for AIDS Research. The song won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. In April 1990, John performed his 1968 ballad "Skyline Pigeon" at the funeral of Ryan White, a teenage haemophiliac he had befriended. The term bitch can refer to a person or thing that is very difficult, as in "Life's a bitch" or "He sure got the bitch end of that deal". It is common for insults to lose intensity as their meaning broadens ("bastard" is another example). In the film The Women (1939), Joan Crawford could only allude to the word:  "And by the way, there's a name for you ladies, but it isn't used in high society - outside of a kennel." At the time, use of the actual word would have been censored by the Hays Office. The first track (and second single released from)  on the 1974 album Caribou, "The Bitch Is Back," with music by Elton John and lyrics by Bernie Taupin, was certified Gold on 13 September 1995 by the Recording Industry Association of America, despite limited airplay because of reluctance to broadcast the word "bitch." The song's title and repeated refrain was a direct quote of Feibelman, who said "the bitch is back" whenever John was in a bad mood. (p83)(p169)
