Papa John’s is an American pizza restaurant franchise. It runs the fourth largest pizza delivery restaurant chain in the United States, with headquarters in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, a suburb of Louisville. Restaurants on Talabat benefit from an online ordering presence and are the alternative to telephone orders and pickup options. Talabat users have access to thousands of restaurants according to the user’s location and the restaurants in the area while filtering by cuisine, ratings, delivery time, minimum order value, payment options or restaurant name. Placed orders are sent to the restaurant’s point of sale machines, processed and then delivered to the customer’s address. The service is free to users without any charges. In January 2002, Papa John's became the first national pizza chain to make online ordering available to all of its U.S. customers. Most other national chains later added online ordering to their services. On July 10, 2004, Papa John's controlled an estimated 6.6% of the market, according to Technomic.
