Hemsworth trained in acting at the National Institute of Dramatic Art. In 2001, he started his career on the Australian soap opera Neighbours as Nathan Tyson. Mainly a television actor, Hemsworth has appeared in TV series such as The Saddle Club, Blue Heelers, Last Man Standing, All Saints, and Satisfaction. In 2012, he starred in the 6-part miniseries Bikie Wars: Brothers in Arms as Gregory "Shadow" Campbell. Hemsworth reprised his role as Thor in Thor: Ragnarok, released on 3 November 2017 in the U.S., and again in both the third and fourth Avengers films, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame in 2018 and 2019 respectively. All three films were critical and commercial success, with Thor: Ragnarok widely described as saving the Thor franchise. Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com positively compared Hemsworth's performance to Cary Grant: "Hemsworth's charisma holds  together whenever it threatens to spin apart".
