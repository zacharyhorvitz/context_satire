 Like many things in life, it's going to get worse before it gets better. That lardy layer of humid, sticky heat oozing over the Northeast and Midwest is getting hotter and spreading out Thursday. But cooling rain will wash it away in some places in the evening. The worst of it started out on the National Weather Service map as bright orange spots over parts of New England and Michigan this week.  The heat began to fade Wednesday afternoon across the Northeast after posting near triple-digit marks from Maryland to Vermont, with another brutal day in store on Thursday. The hot, humid air that's bear-hugged the region drove temperatures up to 96 in New York and Philadelphia, 92 in Boston and  94 as far north as Burlington, Vermont. That mass --  which even the normally staid National Weather Service described as "oppressive" in one advisory -- is expected to hang over the region through Friday. The combination of heat and humidity is expected to drive the heat index, a measurement of how hot it feels to your body, into the triple digits again Thursday.  High temperatures forced Amtrak to keep the brake on rail speed in the Northeast on Friday, while a cold front bearing thunderstorms hinted at some relief from the Great Lakes to northern New England. Amtrak said the speed restrictions were necessary along rail lines between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, because of extreme heat that can distort tracks. Highs in the high 90s were forecast for Philadelphia on Friday. The National Weather Service said there was a slight risk of severe thunderstorms, damaging winds and hail from northern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin east to Maine.
