Gomez also worked with recording team Stargate, who handled "Sober" and "Same Old Love", the latter of which was co-written by British singer Charli XCX. XCX and Gomez weren't in the physical presence of each other during the session, though XCX's manager was present throughout. Gomez was drawn to the track and she believed "Same Old Love" represented her strained relationship with her father and how it reflected on her subsequent romantic relationships. The song's recording sessions took place at Westlake Studios in Los Angeles, and Dreamlab Studios in Studio City, California. For You received a generally mixed to positive reception upon its release. AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars, writing "Gomez might not be a belter or have the electric personality of some of her contemporaries; what she does possess is style, a winning voice, and lots of good songs -- as For You proves again and again." AXS gave the album a score of three and a half, claiming that "Instead of just packaging her hits, Gomez's For You is layered with elements of her personality. The album reflects Selena's highs and lows from the past five years in the industry and serves as closure to her time with Hollywood Records. In January 2012, Gomez announced that the band was on hiatus and that they would not release a new album in 2012. This was later reaffirmed as Gomez announced on her Facebook page that she was taking a break from music in order to focus on her acting career, writing "My band and I are going our separate ways for a while. This year is all about films and acting and I want my band to play music wherever with whoever. We will be back, but it will be a good while."
