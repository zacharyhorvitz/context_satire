For the first two seasons, and most of the third season, Wade is never seen outside his room, until the episode "Team Impossible". When Team Impossible overloads his computer system with a power spike, this angers him so much that he personally arrives on scene, and vents on the three members of the team. In the fourth season, Wade ventures out of his room to give Kim new inventions, and on at least one occasion, to return Kim's battle suit to her after repairs and upgrades were made to it. A running gag throughout the series is that Wade has secretly placed a tracking microchip on Ron, although he tries to avoid answering when questioned about this. Mount Rushmore National Memorial is centered on a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills in Keystone, South Dakota, United States. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture's design and oversaw the project's execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son Lincoln Borglum. The sculpture features the 60-foot (18 m) heads of Presidents George Washington (1732–1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), and Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865), as recommended by Borglum. The four presidents were chosen to represent the nation's birth, growth, development, and preservation, respectively. Joss is Kim, Jim, and Tim's cousin on their father's side and the daughter of "Slim" Possible. She makes only a single in person appearance in the show, but is notable within the franchise in that she is the only Possible family member, other than Kim's mother, whose name is not an allusion to the word "impossible" (it might be an allusion to "just possible"); it is never stated whether Cousin Larry was a Possible or not.
