 In choosing Tim Kaine as her running mate, Hillary Clinton has selected a no-frills politician widely seen as a "safe" choice. Kaine would be the first to say it, calling himself "boring" during a recent interview. But the Virginia senator is not without his quirks. He is one of only 20 people in U.S. history to hold office as a mayor, governor and senator.  Hillary Clinton is poised to reveal her vice presidential candidate Friday in a message to supporters, people close to the search say, and is planning to make her first appearance with her running mate at a campaign rally in Miami on Saturday. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia has emerged as a leading contender after a methodical search, several Democrats close to the campaign say, receiving spirited backing from President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton. In selecting the battleground of Florida to make her public announcement, Clinton is hoping to seize the spotlight from Republicans after their convention in Cleveland. She is set to visit Orlando and Tampa on Friday, but her new partner is not expected to join her until Saturday at a rally here at Florida International University, where the student body is more than half Hispanic.  Tim Kaine took the stage alongside Hillary Clinton in Miami Saturday and offered his first greeting to voters as a vice presidential nominee -- in Spanish. "Bienvenidos a todos," the Virginia senator said, a phrase that translates to "welcome to everyone." Clinton and Kaine's first joint appearance as running mates at a campaign rally here marked the official unveiling of the Democratic ticket. The duo will face off against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov.
