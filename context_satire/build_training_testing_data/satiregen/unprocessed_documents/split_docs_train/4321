Over the next century the library grew to become the largest in America, but on January 24, 1764, a major fire destroyed almost all of Harvard's books and scientific instruments. All of the books in the library at the time of the fire were completely burned. The books that had been loaned out when the fire occurred were the only portion of the collection that remained. Books and donations were offered by friends of the college to replace its collections.  The family of the controversial Harvard professor who commissioned photos of slaves say the university should give the photos to their descendants. Forty-three direct descendants of Prof. Louis Agassiz signed a letter in support of the family of the enslaved man, Renty, and his daughter Delia, whose photos were commissioned by Agassiz in the 1850s. Earlier this year, Tamara Lanier, a descendant of Renty, had filed suit against Harvard asking that the university turn over the images of Renty and to pay unspecified damages. The suit claims the photos of Renty and Delia were taken a few years after Harvard had recruited Agassiz, who espoused a theory that Africans and African-Americans were inferior to whites.  At the end of World War I, leaders of the victorious allies—the United States, Britain, France and Italy—arrived in Paris to begin the Herculean task of ending the First World War and trying, as best they could, to prevent another. As we approach the centenary on June 28 of the signing of The Treaty of Versailles in the glittering Hall of Mirrors of the palace of a succession of French kings, we must try not to make the same catastrophic mistakes again. Now, at least, we have a roadmap. But one that too many of our leaders today seem  determined to ignore at every turn.
