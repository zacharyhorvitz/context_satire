Bergman was soon accepted without having to modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick. :6 "He let her have her way", notes a story in Life magazine. Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and "instructed them to lay off". He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's "synthetic razzle-dazzle". After leaving Harvard, Berman joined ABC News in a junior office post, rising to become Chief Writer for Peter Jennings, the long-term newscaster of ABC World News Tonight. After the inauguration of President George W. Bush, Berman was assigned to cover the White House. After six months, he asked to be reassigned to New York. On his first week in the job, the towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed in the September 11 attacks. Bergman received another Best Actress nomination for Joan of Arc (1948), an independent film based on the Maxwell Anderson play Joan of Lorraine, produced by Walter Wanger, and initially released through RKO. Bergman had championed the role since her arrival in Hollywood, which was one of the reasons she had played it on the Broadway stage in Anderson's play. The film was not a big hit with the public, partly because of the scandal of Bergman's affair with Italian film director Roberto Rossellini, which broke while the film was still in theatres. Even worse, it received disastrous reviews, and, although nominated for several Academy Awards, did not receive a Best Picture nomination.
