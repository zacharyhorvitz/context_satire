 Since Sen. Cory Booker issued a call this week for maintaining a diverse field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, grassroots donors have answered in a big way. The New Jersey Democrat raised more than $1 million dollars between Tuesday -- when Sen. Kamala Harris of California dropped out of the race -- through Friday, his campaign said. His campaign added that Wednesday was his best online fundraising day of the entire campaign. That money came not only from Booker loyalists, but from many new supporters.  The word "love" has been central to Cory Booker's presidential campaign â€” but talk to his team today, and the word "fighting" comes up a lot. Fighting to make the debate stage. Fighting for diversity in the Democratic primary. Fighting against a tide of spending by two billionaire candidates.  Democratic presidential candidate Deval Patrick's campaign is expressing frustration that the former Massachusetts governor will not be listed on Michigan's Democratic primary ballot, while former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who announced his presidential candidacy around the same time as Patrick last month, will be included. "Despite the fact that Governor Patrick declared his candidacy before Michael Bloomberg, the Governor isn't being given the same opportunity to compete and will not be on the ballot as a candidate for President on Michigan's primary Election Day in 2020 unless our campaign collects an onerous number of signatures by Friday -- a barrier no other candidate has had to overcome," Patrick campaign manager Abe Rakov said. But a state party source tells CNN that Patrick will not be listed for a simple reason: His campaign didn't ask. The unforced error reflects the unseen logistical challenges of mounting a last-minute presidential campaign and building an organization on the fly.
