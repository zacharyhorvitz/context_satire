 Sen. Susan Collins, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, argued that President Donald Trump was not immune to an investigation into his financial dealings by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller. "The President can't set red lines for Bob Mueller," the Republican from Maine told CNN's Dana Bash in an exclusive joint interview that also featured Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. "Well said," Murkowski added. CNN reported Thursday that Mueller and his team are now looking into Trump and his associates' financial ties to Russia as they investigate the 2016 presidential election and whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.  President Donald Trump has a lot to say about the ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian meddling into the 2016 campaign. He's called it a "phony Russian Witch Hunt" and the "Russia hoax" story. Trump's lawyers have been building what amounts to an opposition research file on Robert Mueller, the head of the special counsel investigation, and the rest of his team. By contrast, Mueller and his investigators have been totally silent.  Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller has issued grand jury subpoenas related to Donald Trump Jr.'s 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower, according to a person familiar with the matter. The subpoena seeks both documents and testimony from people involved in the meeting, CNN has learned. That meeting has drawn scrutiny since an email exchange beforehand indicated the Russians offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Mueller's grand jury activity was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
