 Colombia's Medellin once had a bad reputation -- so bad, that some locals darkly nicknamed it "machine gun city." The hometown of infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar became a hotbed of crime in the 1990s and early 2000s, plagued by thousands of murders. Its sprawling suburbs were particularly dangerous, cut off from the wealthier city center by steep hills. Over the past decade, however, city authorities have found a way to connect these neighborhoods with the rest of the city, and the world -- by building libraries. Center City includes the central business district and central neighborhoods of Philadelphia, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It comprises the area that made up the City of Philadelphia prior to the Act of Consolidation, 1854 which extended the city borders to be coterminous with Philadelphia County. Greater Center City has grown into the second-most densely populated downtown area in the United States, after Midtown Manhattan in New York City, with an estimated 193,000 residents in 2018.  Hundreds of cities are vying to be Amazon's second home. But a history of controversial legislation could hold some of them back. Amazon says 238 cities and regions across North America put in bids to become its second headquarters, the company's largest expansion outside Seattle. The winner gets tens of thousands of jobs and a lift for the local economy.
