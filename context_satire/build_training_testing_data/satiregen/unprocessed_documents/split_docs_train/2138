 Seven days after a horrific shooting claimed the lives of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the front pages of some of the nation's largest newspapers are still featuring stories about gun control and school safety. Victims' family members and survivors in Parkland, Florida, are still being interviewed, nearly by the hour, on television.

The Florida state House on Tuesday rejected a ban on many semiautomatic guns and large capacity magazines as dozens of survivors of last week's school shooting headed to the state Capitol to turn their grief into political action. Lawmakers voted down a motion to consider the ban during a session that opened with a prayer for the 17 people killed by a former student last Wednesday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. The vote in the Republican-dominated body was 36-71. Stoneman Douglas students in the gallery of the Capitol during the vote appeared stunned.  The last 24 hours have featured a more intense -- and, generally speaking, more honest -- national conversation about guns and culture than in, at least, the last five years. From CNN's terrific -- yes, I am biased but it was really good --   town hall in Sunrise, Florida, on Wednesday night to a series of tweets and comments from President Donald Trump Thursday morning, the past day has been a crash course in what's possible (and impossible) in the current gun debate.
