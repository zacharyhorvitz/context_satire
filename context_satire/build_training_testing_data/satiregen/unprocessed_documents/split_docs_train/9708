 President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani said Wednesday that special counsel Robert Mueller could still try to seek additional answers from Trump on questions of potential obstruction of justice, but he signaled they will fight any questions they believe violate executive privilege. "It's not on the table, but could be put back on the table," Giuliani told CNN of obstruction questions. Trump submitted written responses to the special counsel's office on Tuesday to respond to questions surrounding collusion between Russian officials and Trump's team during the campaign. But Giuliani made clear the process isn't over and the President's legal team is willing to answer follow up questions from Mueller's team. Trump said in July 2016 that his father, Donald Trump, had made "hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal donations" to the Eric Trump Foundation in the past, although the Eric Trump Foundation's tax records don't explicitly show such donations. When The Washington Post followed up for evidence, Trump appeared to backtrack and refused to give details.  We know that President Donald Trump and lawyers submitted their written responses to special counsel Robert Mueller's questions this week. And now, thanks to the one and only Dana Bash, we know how Trump answered two of the most critical questions of the investigation. Those questions are these: 1) Did Roger Stone tell Trump about WikiLeaks and its plans to release emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chair John Podesta? 2) Did Trump know in advance of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Russian officials and his top campaign brass -- including his son, Don Jr., and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner?
