 The United States just offered a rare glimpse into the inner workings of Huawei, the Chinese telecoms company at the heart of the escalating clash between Washington and Beijing over technology. In indictments released late Monday, US prosecutors accuse Huawei's employees, executives and even its founder of repeatedly lying to government officials and business partners for the Chinese company's benefit. The documents outline in detail an alleged scheme to pay employees to steal trade secrets. Huawei said in a statement that it is disappointed to learn of the charges brought against the company.  Measles, the highly contagious and previously eliminated viral illness, has been spreading in communities across the United States in recent weeks, with Washington declaring a state of emergency last week and New York reporting in 2018 its second largest outbreak over the past two decades. As the cases increase in these communities, we sit down with Dr. Julia S.

Tonight, Trump is delivering his address in the wake of the longest government shutdown in US history.
