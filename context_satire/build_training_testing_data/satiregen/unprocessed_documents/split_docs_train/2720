 Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will face off in CNN's Democratic presidential debate in Brooklyn Thursday night as they spar ahead of a critical contest in New York -- a state where both candidates have deep roots. The April 19 primary here will come as Clinton -- whose campaign has been dogged by Sanders' unexpected endurance -- is on an urgent mission to widen her delegate lead and lock up her party's nomination. Next week's contest will serve as one of Sanders' last opportunities to change the dynamics of the Democratic race. And in turn, it will offer Clinton a crucial opening to once and for all shake the pervasive narrative that her rival -- even as he lags behind in the delegate count -- continues to enjoy real momentum; tens of thousands of Sanders supporters rallied in Washington Square Park in Manhattan Wednesday night.  The Democratic presidential primary may be getting serious, but Bernie Sanders took on a more humorous tone Thursday night when he played "Ya Bernt" with late night host Seth Meyers. The game is a campaign-inspired derivative of NBC's "Late Night with Seth Meyers"' usual segment "Ya Burnt," and this time the Vermont independent senator issued some advice to big banks and, yes, couples. "The big banks? You're not too big to fail -- you fail!  With Hillary Clinton way ahead in the delegate count as well as in the most recent polls for the New York primary, it is becoming a near certainty that she will be the Democratic Party nominee. But Bernie Sanders refuses to give up. He is a man with a message -- promising more for the middle, less for the top -- and he took the fight to Hillary on the debate stage Thursday night with gusto. Brooklyn was a particularly symbolic backdrop for the Bernie vs. Hillary battle.
