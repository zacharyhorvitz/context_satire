Recently Dockers as a company have gone away from their basic khaki pants and tried to become a more diversified brand. They have overhauled their corporate structure and product assortment in a strategy to try to revitalize their core competency, the khaki pant. According to Jim Calhoun, former  president of Dockers, “The brand is going back to focusing on what we do best: khaki pants for men." Dockers is trying to boost the selling of khaki pants, as it is a declining product among consumers. The blue and gold in Visa's logo were chosen to represent the blue sky and gold-colored hills of California, where the Bank of America was founded. In 1984, most Visa cards around the world began to feature a hologram of a dove on its face, generally under the last four digits of the Visa number. This was implemented as a security feature – true holograms would appear three-dimensional and the image would change as the card was turned. At the same time, the Visa logo, which had previously covered the whole card face, was reduced in size to a strip on the card's right incorporating the hologram. This allowed issuing banks to customize the appearance of the card.
