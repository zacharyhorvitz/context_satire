Stenberg left office as Attorney General in 2003 and returned to work in the private sector as of counsel at Erickson and Sederstrom, the same firm where his former boss, Charles Thone, is a partner. In January 2012, after incumbent Democratic Senator Ben Nelson announced his retirement, Fischer officially announced she would run for the U.S. Senate. The Republican primary campaign was expected to shape up as a battle between Attorney General Jon Bruning and State Treasurer Don Stenberg; Fischer and three less well-known candidates were also on the ballot. Don Stenberg (born September 30, 1948) is a politician from the state of Nebraska in the Midwestern United States, who served as Nebraska's state treasurer from 2011 to 2019. He previously served as Attorney General of Nebraska from 1991 to 2003 and also served as legal counsel to Governor Charles Thone from 1979 to 1983. He has run unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor of Nebraska in 1978, Attorney General in 1986 and for the United States Senate in 1996, 2000, 2006 and 2012. Stenberg is a member of the Republican Party.
