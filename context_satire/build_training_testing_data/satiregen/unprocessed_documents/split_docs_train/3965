 Dangerous cold and treacherous driving conditions left millions of Americans along the Eastern Seaboard stuck at home Wednesday. And, try as we might, we couldn't get any glimmers of hope from the CNN weather department's forecast for what's ahead. The storm system that dumped record-breaking piles of snow -- including 18-inch snowdrifts in Plymouth, Massachusetts --  is moving off the coast, and remaining blizzard warnings are expiring. But the freezing weather is going to stick around. In the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries were never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.  A fire swept through an apartment complex for the elderly in the small Quebec town of L'Isle-Verte early Thursday, killing at least five and leaving roughly 30 others unaccounted for, police said. Frigid temperatures have made search efforts difficult, police Lt. Guy Lapointe said  hours after the fire began. Water used to fight the blaze has frozen into ice, he said, trapping pockets of fire, and possibly victims, in the collapsed three-story building.
