MyBudget is an Australian company based in the financial services industry. The company focuses on providing budget management service to its clients. MyBudget was first founded in 1999 and its headquarters are in Adelaide, Australia on Frome Street. The company was founded by Tammy Barton (then May), who went on to win various awards in Australia following the success of the company. Barton handed in a written transfer request in January 2006, which the club rejected. The following day, they also rejected a verbal offer for Barton from Middlesbrough, with Stuart Pearce stating that a deal could still be made to keep him at the club. During the following week, Barton said that he had been "a little bit impetuous" in making such a request and agreed to begin negotiations on a new contract at City. He was rewarded with a new four-year deal, which he signed on 25 July, ending speculation about his future. Barton started MyBudget as a home-based business in Adelaide in 1999 at the age of 22 after working at a debt collection agency where she witnessed the damaging effects of financial stress on people. The business has since grown into a national company that employs more than 250 staff in 15 offices across Australia. During that time, the company has delivered its money management services to more than 65,000 clients.
