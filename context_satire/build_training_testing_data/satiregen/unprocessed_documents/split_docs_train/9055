 White House aides who steeled themselves for what President Donald Trump would say when he finally addressed the sexual assault allegation against his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh were quietly stunned when Trump said the process should be followed and the accuser should be heard. In recent days, Trump has bragged about the positive coverage he's received for his response, according to multiple sources. That response has contributed to him continuing to say Christine Blasey Ford should come forward with her story, they said. As of Thursday, officials felt confident Kavanaugh was back on track toward confirmation.  Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York knocked the GOP's handling of accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying Wednesday that the scheduled hearing for Monday would be a "sham." "They are trying to create a sham hearing on Monday," Gillibrand told CNN's Jim Acosta on "The Situation Room." Gillibrand said that without first deferring to an FBI investigation into the allegations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford against Kavanaugh and requesting corroborating witnesses to testify, the Senate Judiciary Committee's approach would amount to a "he said-she said" that was unfair to Ford. In a letter from her attorneys on Tuesday, Ford called for an FBI investigation into her allegations before she would testify to Congress.  Sexual assault allegations levied against President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee have spurred intensive conversations at the White House over how to proceed, officials and advisers said on Monday. Judge Brett Kavanaugh was seen arriving to the West Wing just past 10 a.m. ET on Monday, swiftly ducking into the building after stepping from a black SUV. His arrival coincided with a new statement, released by the White House, in which the federal judge again denied the allegations of sexual assault.
