The Dog (also known as Storyville: The Great Sex Addict Heist) is a 2013 documentary film co-written and co-directed by Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren, about the real life story of bisexual bank robber John Wojtowicz that inspired the 1975 Al Pacino movie Dog Day Afternoon about his August 1972 attempted heist and 14-hour televised hostage situation in Brooklyn to pay for his lover's sex-reassignment surgery.
