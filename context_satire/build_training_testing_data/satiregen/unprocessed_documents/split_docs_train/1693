According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2013, Brownsville Area High School reported an enrollment of 519 pupils in grades 9th through 12th, with 302 pupils eligible for a federal free or reduced price lunch due to the family meeting the federal poverty level. In 2013, the School employed 36 teachers yielding a student-teacher ratio of 14:1. According to a report by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 100% of its teachers were rated "Highly Qualified" under No Child Left Behind. Built in 1961 near the Redstone football field, that building was salvaged and the new high school in Brownsville was built in 2006. The Brownsville Area School Board elected to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. In November 2017, Geyer announced that he would be leaving The Grill Team.
