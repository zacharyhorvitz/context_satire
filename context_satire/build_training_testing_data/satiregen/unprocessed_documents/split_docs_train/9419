 As likely Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney aims his firepower at President Barack Obama, he still has to protect his flank from rival Rick Santorum in a primary battle that Romney has all but won. The former Massachusetts governor painted that picture while campaigning Thursday in Pennsylvania ahead of the state's April 24 primary. Asked if Santorum, the ex-senator from Pennsylvania, would win in his home state, Romney said, "I think everybody expects someone to win their home state. Newt Gingrich won his state. On April 10, Santorum announced the suspension of his campaign. Following this announcement, The Newt 2012 campaign used a new slogan referring to Gingrich as "the last conservative standing". Despite this, on April 19, Gingrich told Republicans in New York that he would work to help Romney win the general election if Romney secured the nomination.  Consistently defiant rivals are doing little to hamper Mitt Romney's momentum ahead of nominating contests on Tuesday in what is shaping up to be more of a general election fight between the former Massachusetts governor and President Barack Obama's re-election team. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich on Sunday insisted they will stay in the race until a candidate reaches 1,144 delegates -- the necessary threshold to win the Republican presidential nomination -- while acknowledging Romney currently has the advantage. Santorum cited the Democratic nomination fight in 2008 and Mike Huckabee's Republican presidential bid in 2008 to push back against the narrative the former Pennsylvania senator is hurting the party. "Four years ago, everyone said, 'Oh, we got to wrap this thing up' and we did, and John McCain was the nominee and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton went in the summer and pounded it out," Santorum said on "Fox News Sunday."
