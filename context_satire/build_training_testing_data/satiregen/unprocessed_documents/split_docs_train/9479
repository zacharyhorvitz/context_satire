In August 2017, a majority stake in MoviePass was sold to the analytics firm Helios and Matheson. At the same time, the company announced that it would lower its price for an unlimited plan allowing one film per-day, to $9.95 per month. Lowe explained that "after years of studying and analysis we found that people want to go to the movies more often, but the pricing keeps going up, and that prevents them from going more. We're making it more affordable for people."  MoviePass isn't finished making changes. The troubled movie subscription service told customers Thursday that it will limit the films and showtimes that are available each day. The restrictions are part of the company's transition to a new plan that allows customers to see only three movies a month. Previously, MoviePass offered a movie every day.  MoviePass says it has finally nailed down its business model. CEO Mitch Lowe says its latest offer — 3 movies a month for $10 — will make the company sustainable. It has been burning through tens of millions of dollars each month paying for its movie-a-day program. "It is really tough to launch a business that shoots up like a rocket ship, but hasn't completely got the business model right," Lowe told CNNMoney's Christine Romans on "Markets Now."
