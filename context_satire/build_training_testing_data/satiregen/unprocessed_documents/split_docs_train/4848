In 1887, the LDS Church was legally dissolved in the United States by the Edmundsâ€“Tucker Act because of the church's practice of polygamy. In the United States, the church continues to operate as an unincorporated entity. Common informal names for the church include the LDS Church, the Latter-day Saints, and the Mormons. The term Mormon Church is in common use, but the church began discouraging its use in the late 20th century.  The election of a pope from Latin America shows the emerging influence of the region in the Catholic church and the world, church officials and world leaders said Wednesday. "His selection ... speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world," U.S. President Barack Obama said. Obama said he looked forward to working with the pope to advance peace and dignity for people, regardless of their faiths. "The election of a pope from the 'new world' is an occasion of genuinely historic proportions," Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in a statement.  More than 140 Catholic cardinals met Monday at the Vatican, where the process of selecting a new pope edged toward beginning. The cardinals met twice during the day, in the morning and in the evening. After the evening session, most left by car, though some departed on foot. Few spoke as they left the meeting.
