 Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina met Wednesday with community leaders in Ferguson, Missouri, aides told CNN, and is now returning to his home state to help deal with fallout from the shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer in North Charleston. Scott, who is also African-American, was in the St. Louis area attending a political fundraiser, aides said, when news of the shooting broke on Tuesday. Before flying back to South Carolina, aides said he met with clergy and community leaders in Missouri, hoping to get suggestions for how a police officer's use of lethal force can impact a community. The South Carolina Republican is expected to meet with the family of Walter Scott, who was killed in the shooting, as early as this evening when he returns to South Carolina.  A South Carolina officer has been charged with murder after a video surfaced that appears to show him shooting an unarmed man who was running away. Michael Slager, an officer with the North Charleston Police Department, was arrested Tuesday, according to a statement from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, or SLED. If found guilty of murder, he could face up to life in prison or death. The shooting took place Saturday morning after a traffic stop, SLED said.  The officer charged with murder in the shooting death of an unarmed black man in South Carolina has been fired as anger continues to build around his case. A video shows Officer Michael Slager, who is white, firing eight shots at 50-year-old Walter Scott as Scott has his back to him and is running away. Scott, who was unarmed, was struck five times.
