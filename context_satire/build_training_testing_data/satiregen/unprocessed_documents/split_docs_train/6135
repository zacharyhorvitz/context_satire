Giamatti received his second Golden Globe win for Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy for his role in the 2010 film, Barney's Version. Giamatti starred as the lead in the comedy-drama film Win Win, which earned positive reviews from critics. The same year he had small roles in Ironclad, The Hangover Part II and The Ides of March. In 1997, Giamatti landed in his first high-profile role as Kenny "Pig Vomit" Rushton in the film adaptation of Howard Stern's Private Parts. Stern praised Giamatti's performance often on his radio program, calling for him to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 1998, Giamatti appeared in a number of supporting roles in the big-budget films, The Truman Show, Saving Private Ryan and The Negotiator. In 1999, he played Bob Zmuda and Tony Clifton in Miloš Forman's Andy Kaufman biopic, Man on the Moon. Will O'Brien of TV Squad thought "Company of Thieves" was, for the most part, a good one, despite a disappointing performance by Rudolf Martin. Jason Van Horn of IGN, however, was less than impressed, suggesting that the episode just wasn't interesting – that the Lucian Alliance was an enemy no one cares about and that Paul Emerson wasn't enough of a character within the show for his death to have had any meaningful impact.
