The Tom Bradyâ€“Peyton Manning rivalry is a series of games that took place between 2001 and 2016, involving two quarterbacks in the National Football League (NFL): Tom Brady and Peyton Manning. Brady has played for the New England Patriots since 2000, when he was the 199th selection in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. After Drew Bledsoe was injured in week 2 of the 2001 season, Tom Brady got his first career start against Peyton Manning's Colts, winning the game 44-13. Brady has been the Patriots' starting quarterback since, with the exception of 2008, when he tore his ACL in the opening game, as well as in 2016, when Brady was suspended for the first 4 games due to his involvement in the Deflategate scandal.
