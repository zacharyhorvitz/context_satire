ARC Records made special trips to Ireland in hopes of discovering new Irish talent in hopes of duplicating the success of the Abbey Tavern Singers. The popularity of "We're Off To Dublin in the Green" inspired several cover versions, not all of which were appreciated by the Abbey Tavern Singers. Since its inception, the Lord's Taverners has developed into a membership charity. For the first fifteen years, the NPFA was the sole beneficiary of the Lord's Taverners, with the money all going to cricket projects, mostly for the installation of artificial pitches. "We've all got professional and sporting interests in common. So why not start a club, based at the beloved old tavern here. We can talk about our work and watch the cricket. And we can try to put a few bob back into the game at the same time."
