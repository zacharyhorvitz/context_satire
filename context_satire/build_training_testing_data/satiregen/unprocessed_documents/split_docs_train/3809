Through extensive promoting, including distributing tapes on consignment to local stores and giving away free samplers of his music, Kid Rock developed a following among an audience which DJ Uncle Kracker described as "white kids who dropped acid and liked listening to gangsta rap"; this following included local rapper Joe C, who had been attending Kid Rock concerts as a fan, but upon meeting Kid Rock, was invited to perform on stage as Kid Rock's hype man. The three main buildings at the site are the Davis Building, the Mayo Building (including the hospital) and the Cannaday Building. They are connected to two hotels, The Inn at Mayo Clinic and Marriott’s Courtyard Jacksonville Mayo Clinic/Beaches. Laboratory research is also conducted on Mayo’s campus. Mayo’s research is focused on cancer, neurological and neuro-degenerative diseases. This led to the creation of the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) in 1915. MFMER was established as a department of the University of Minnesota with a $1.5 million donation to offer graduate programs at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. During the same time period, the Mayo brothers created the Mayo Properties Association which converted the Mayo Clinic into a non-profit association practice. Mayo Properties Association later became the Mayo Foundation.
