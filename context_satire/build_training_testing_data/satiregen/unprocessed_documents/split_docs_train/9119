In 2010 Kimora launched her contemporary KLS fashion collection, which retailed to department stores like Macy’s. In tandem, the designer and creative director launched Kouture by Kimora, a brand of under $40 clothes exclusively for Macy’s. "I wanted to do something that spoke to a different market for Macy's. It sits in a different section. Kimora has a long history of philanthropy establishing and sponsoring programs at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) in NYC and the Fashion Institute for Design and Merchandising (FIDM) in LA. Kimora personally donated one million dollars of her own money to students pursuing careers in fashion. Speaking to FIT students in 2014, Kimora said, “I’m from St. Louis, Missouri, for those of you that may not know, and growing up in St. Louis, the fashion industry always felt so far away, like millions of miles away,” she said. “I always knew that I wanted to be a part of it, but I never really imagined how to make that happen for myself, and I imagine that’s the case for maybe a lot of you.” As a marketing strategy, the Zale brothers instituted a credit plan whereby customers could pay "a penny down and a dollar a week," making jewelry and other merchandise affordable for the average working American. The success of this credit policy led to the company expanding to a total of 12 stores in Oklahoma and Texas by 1941. Zales Jewelers moved its headquarters from Wichita Falls to Dallas in 1946. In 1998, online shopping was opened at www.zales.com.
