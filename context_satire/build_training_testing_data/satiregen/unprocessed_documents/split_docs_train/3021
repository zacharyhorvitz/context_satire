It was established at the request of the United Nations General Assembly who called on the Economic and Social Council to create the Commission, as well as the Commission for Asia and the Far East, in order to "give effective aid to countries devastated by war." The United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC; French: Conseil Ã©conomique et social des Nations unies, CESNU) is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations, responsible for coordinating the economic and  social fields of the organisation, specifically in regards to the 15 specialised agencies, the eight functional commissions and the five regional commissions under its jurisdiction. The Council serves as the central forum for discussing international economic and social issues and formulating policy recommendations addressed to member states and the United Nations system. A number of non-governmental organisations have been granted consultative status to the Council to participate in the work of the United Nations. It holds one four-week session each year in July, and since 1998, it has also held an annual meeting in April with finance ministers heading key committees of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is one of the five regional commissions under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It was established in order to increase economic activity in Asia and the Far East, as well as to foster economic relations between the region and other areas of the world.
