 Netflix is riding high right now. With a rise in subscriptions and its stock price, its footprint in the entertainment industry is vast, big names are flocking to make deals with it, and competitors are lining up to compete with it -- or barring that, bulking up to combat it. There's room to wonder, however, if the streaming service's strategy is beginning to yield diminishing returns -- and specifically, whether the sheer volume of its original programming is growing beyond what Netflix can effectively market. If the service once showcased new programs, today one is as apt to stumble upon them as much out of serendipity as by virtue of its promotional efforts. Jeffrey Todd Garlin (born June 5, 1962) is an American comedian and actor. He plays Jeff Greene on the HBO show Curb Your Enthusiasm, Mort Meyers on Arrested Development for Fox and Netflix and Murray Goldberg, the patriarch of the eponymous family in the ABC sitcom The Goldbergs. He has also appeared in ParaNorman, Wall-E, Toy Story 3 and Safety Not Guaranteed, among other films and has hosted his own podcast on Earwolf since 2013.  The cremated remains of notorious cult leader Charles Manson were scattered on a California hillside following a Christian funeral on Saturday, nearly four months after his death. The burial came one week after Manson's grandson, Jason Freeman, won the right to his grandfather's body after a court battle that began shortly after Manson's death on November 19. The family "acted like ninjas" to keep the funeral in Porterville, California, from gaining attention, Freeman said. About 20 people attended, he said, describing them as his grandfather's best friends from before and during Manson's 46-year incarceration.
