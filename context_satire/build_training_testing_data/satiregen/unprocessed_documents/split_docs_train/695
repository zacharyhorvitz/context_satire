 The proverbial elephant of the GOP primary season, Donald Trump, won't be in the room on Monday night as most of his rivals answer questions at a Republican presidential forum in New Hampshire. Trump's absence is the result of his annoyance with the sponsor and could make the New Hampshire event significantly different from the GOP debate being sponsored by Fox News later this week where Trump will be center stage. At a forum, candidates are questioned one at a time. At a debate, they can challenge each other.  Facebook is asking its users to recommend questions to ask Republican presidential candidates at the debate it is co-hosting with Fox News on Thursday, and Donald Trump was more than happy to help out. Trump, who will stand at the center of the stage in Cleveland, Ohio, offered his own question for the other candidates in a 12-second video posted Monday. "I'd like to ask all of the candidates -- that is, politicians and really not negotiators, people that don't negotiate jobs and lots of other things -- how are you going to make America great again?" Trump said.  There were 17 Republican candidates here tonight, but the first GOP presidential debate of the 2016 season overwhelmingly revolved around one man: Donald Trump. The billionaire real estate mogul delivered an unforgettably explosive performance Thursday night. He repeatedly attacked his rivals on stage, jousted with the moderators, drew jeers and laughter from the audience with his typically colorful language and, true to form, refused to apologize for anything. The nine candidates flanking Trump at the prime-time debate appeared emboldened at times by Trump's bluster and, at other moments, amused by the conduct of the GOP's current frontrunner.
