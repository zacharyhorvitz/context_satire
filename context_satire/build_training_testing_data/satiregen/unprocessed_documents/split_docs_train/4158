 Now the real Boston Marathon trial can begin. A federal jury's decision to convict Dzhokhar Tsarnaev of 30 charges related to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings was the most anticlimactic of anticlimaxes. The 21-year-old's lawyers admitted from the beginning that their client had participated in the horrific terrorist attack, which both scarred and strengthened this city. The outcome of this first phase may have been preordained, but nearly two years after the bombing, the trial has held Boston and the region in thrall — more so than I might have imagined.  A call by the Boston Globe to spare convicted marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from the death penalty has sparked an outcry from some as well as impassioned agreement by others. "Get sparky ready," wrote Sunday@1 after the Globe's editorial was published Wednesday. It was one of more than 100 comments in response to the Globe's editorial. Tzarnaev, 21, was convicted on Wednesday of 30 counts for the 2013 bombing that killed four people, maimed others and both traumatized and infuriated Bostonians.  Guilty across the board. But will he face death? After deliberating for 11½ hours, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on Wednesday of all 30 counts he faced in the Boston Marathon bombing trial. Seventeen of the 30 counts were capital charges, meaning he is eligible for the death penalty.
