Before Peter was born, his mother Thelma went to Mexico City to have an abortion. However, she gave birth during the procedure, and smuggled him home to Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent his childhood. Peter was raised by Francis and Thelma Griffin in the Roman Catholic faith. However, in "Peter's Two Dads", he discovers that his biological father is an Irishman named Mickey McFinnigan. Peter is best friends with his anthropomorphic dog, Brian. In earlier seasons, Brian often served as a voice of reason for Peter, helping him out with issues. Brian is extremely grateful to Peter for picking him up as a stray, shown during a flashback in the episode, "Brian: Portrait of a Dog". His gratitude was affirmed in, "New Kidney in Town", where Brian is prepared to give up both his kidneys (and his life), so that Peter could undergo a kidney transplant (although he did not have to do it thanks to another donor being found). Elisabeth Kübler-Ross died on August 24, 2004. Her last book, co-written with David Kessler, “On Grief and Grieving,” was completed one month before her death. It is her final legacy, one that brings her life’s work full circle. David Kessler worked closely with Elisabeth for ten years and was with her as she was dying.
