The fifth film was written, and may have been produced. Frankie Thomas believes that he and Granville made five films, not four. In addition, Harriet Adams wrote to Mildred Wirt, the ghostwriter of the books at the time, in August 1939 that "three have been shown in this area, and I have just heard that a fifth is in production." The series debuted to positive reviews, with praise going towards its noir-themed tone. Comics blog Readingwithaflightring.com declared it, “the best 'modern' approach to updating a franchise like this that I’ve seen. It works on every level and still fully embraces the heart of who they are." Aintitcool.com reviewer Lyz Reblin stated, “The strength of the series thus far is Ms. Drew, who was absent for most of the first issue. When the series came back for a third season, Nancy Drew was dropped from the series, with it now focusing completely on the Hardy Boys. But soon after the change, ABC cancelled the series.
