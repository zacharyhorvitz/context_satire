The German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Schäferhund, German pronunciation: ) is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany. In the English language, the breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog (sometimes abbreviated as GSD).

A German man in his 70s is missing and 1,600 people have been evacuated because of flash floods in France, according to authorities.

Divers and a helicopter have been deployed to search for the missing man, Souliman said. In southeastern France, 1,600 people were evacuated because of a "violent" storm, according to a government statement Thursday.
