 It took virtually no time at all. As soon as the government shutdown took effect at midnight, Americans of all stripes found their lives affected, and for some, their livelihoods threatened. Federal workers who have already suffered through furloughs suddenly found themselves at home, unsure of their financial futures. Rob Merritt, a defense worker, feared he might have to file for bankruptcy -- his only solace Tuesday coming after learning he'd been spared being furloughed for at least a week, though he very much remains in limbo beyond that, CNN Money reported.  The government shutdown is "extremely damaging" to U.S. intelligence operations, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday. Clapper noted that he has worked in the intelligence field for 50 years, and "never seen anything like this." The shutdown "seriously damages our ability to protect the safety and security of this nation," he told a Senate panel. The law allows intelligence agencies to hold on to the employees needed to protect against "imminent threat to life or property," he noted. Prominent Founding Fathers writing in The Federalist Papers felt that elections were essential to liberty, that a bond between the people and the representatives was particularly essential, and that "frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured". In 2009, however, few Americans were familiar with leaders of Congress. The percentage of Americans eligible to vote who did, in fact, vote was 63% in 1960, but has been falling since, although there was a slight upward trend in the 2008 election. Public opinion polls asking people if they approve of the job Congress is doing have, in the last few decades, hovered around 25% with some variation.
