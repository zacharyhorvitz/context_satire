Will Tracy, an associate editor at The Onion, told the New York Times in 2010 that the Office of the Vice President had sent the Onion staff an email with the message "Keep it up. He really likes it." Tracy commented, "Apparently he's a fan." Biden's office denied being aware of any communication between the Vice President and The Onion. Eric Metaxas discussed the character with Biden at the 2012 National Prayer Breakfast. Metaxas, who was the event's keynote speaker, was making small talk with Biden before his speech and asked the vice president if he was aware of the Onion pieces. According to Metaxas, Biden replied "yes, he had seen them, and he didn't mind them at all, because they were so obviously about someone who was completely different from what he was really like. ... Then he added, as a kind of Q.E.D.  A male suspect wearing a backpack scaled the White House fence Tuesday and "took off at a full sprint," but was chased down and arrested, a spokesman for the U.S. Secret Service said. The president and the first lady were not in the White House at the time, and a search of the suspect's bag revealed that he was not armed, said Secret Service spokesman Max Millen. The fence-jumper, who has not yet been identified, complied with officers' commands to stop, was taken into custody and will be charged with unlawful entry, Millen said. It is not uncommon for people to scale a fence at the White House, only to come to a similar fate.
