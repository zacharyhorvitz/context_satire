 On Monday, the NASA Mars InSight lander survived the "seven minutes of terror" during entry, descent and landing to safely arrive on Mars and took up permanent residence on the Red Planet. Unlike the rovers already on the Martian surface, InSight will stay put during its planned two-year mission. What will the stationary craft do until November 24, 2020? InSight has already been busy.  After scoring a touchdown, NFL players often celebrate in the end zone with elaborate spectacles. Why should it be any different for NASA engineers? After the InSight lander's successful touchdown Monday on the surface of Mars, mission control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, erupted in wild cheers. Then a pair of engineers broke out with an intricate handshake that set the internet on fire. After leaving R.P.I Kobie took a career at NASA in their Jet Propulsion Laboratory, working on trips from Mars to planet Earth. Kobie Boykins is a senior mechanical engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Boykins has now been working at NASA for 22 years and enjoys working in the laboratory as of 1996. He worked with his team to design the solar array systems for the Mars exploration rovers Spirit and Opportunity, and designed the actuators on the Mars rover Curiosity, the name of both wings.
