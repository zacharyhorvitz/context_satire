A 2000 The New York Times article about the end of the dot-com bubble noted, "The saying around San Francisco Web shops these days, as companies run out of money, is 'Just keep drinking the Kool-Aid,' a tasteless reference to the Jonestown massacre." Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4 out of 5, saying "One of the best things about "Drink the Kool-Aid" is how some of the most horrifying subtext is played out in the most mundane of settings, a boring city council meeting with gaping apes or a quaint kitchen table set for two. American Horror Story: Cult ends the episode on a terrifyingly ambiguous note, Ally's ascension in Kai's attentions.

The Kool-Aid Man, an anthropomorphic pitcher filled with Kool-Aid, is the mascot of Kool-Aid. The character was introduced shortly after General Foods acquired the brand in the 1950s.
