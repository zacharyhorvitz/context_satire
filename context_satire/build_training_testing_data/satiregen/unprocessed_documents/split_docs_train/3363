 All over the country, bills are being filed that treat transgender people like pawns in a chess game. North Carolina has passed the most extreme anti-LGBT law in recent history, forbidding transgender people to use restrooms that correspond to the gender they live as every day. Meanwhile, a bill that would have made it legal for some groups to deny employment or services to LGBT people just narrowly escaped becoming law in Georgia, while in 31 additional states, transgender people lack explicit protections from discrimination. That discrimination is a reality that's too common for too many Americans, including myself as a transgender man.  Three out of every four Americans believe the media has given too much coverage to Donald Trump, a new survey from the Pew Research Center says. Asked how news organizations have been covering the presidential candidates, 75% of respondents said too much coverage had been given to Trump. Only 4% said that the reality television star had been given too little. The finding comes two weeks after a New York Times study found that Trump had earned close to $2 billion worth of free media attention during the 2016 campaign, eclipsing the total value of media attention given to all of his Republican competitors combined.  After keeping a tight hold on their wallets in the aftermath of the Great Recession, Americans are spending once again. The typical household shelled out $36,800 in 2014, according to a study published Wednesday by the Pew Charitable Trusts. That's up nearly 14% from 2004 and more than 25% since 1996. Much of the increase came after 2012, signaling that Americans are moving past the twin economic and housing collapses of the last decade.
