In mid-August, UniquePhones announced an unlocking service for iPhone, only to retract the service the following week after receiving a phone call from a lawyer representing AT&T. On August 24, 2007, George Hotz, a 17-year-old hacker from Glen Rock, New Jersey, broke the lock that ties iPhone to AT&T's wireless network. He confirmed that he unlocked the phone and was using it on T-Mobile's network. The hack opened up a realm of possibilities for overseas customers because iPhone was only sold in the United States at the time. After the announcement of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device. At a bar, Deb Clarington, a camera operator for the local  news, sees an attractive man, Ryan Waverly. Although she is initially too insecure to approach him, her friend Ruby talks her into it. While awkwardly hitting on him, Deb is interrupted by Ryan's fiance, who breaks up with him when he refuses to accept a high-paying job at his father's company. The next thing Deb knows, she wakes in Ryan's bed with a hangover.
