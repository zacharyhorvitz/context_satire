A July 2, 2018 article in the Collegiate Times reviewed the master plan for Virginia Tech's campus to change significantly in the coming years. The article indicates that the university plans for the Duck Pond to replace the Drillfield as the campus' center. This finding was confirmed by President Sands on July 10, tweeting that "While the Duck Pond is becoming somewhat more central with respect to the flow of people (and ducks), the Drillfield will always be the cultural and historical center of campus, as well as the physical place that reminds all of us what it means to be a Hokie." The AAGJSSCTEJUVA is perhaps the most secret secret society at the University of Virginia with its roots dating back to the late 1940s. In addition to the group's full name being secret, the exact mission of The AAGJSSCTEJUVA has yet to be uncovered. However, a manifesto from November 7, 2000 revealed that the group has historically harbored ambitions to destroy the McIntire School of Commerce and obliterate corporate power at UVA. Additionally, a recent leak in the Society's archives revealed that The AAGJSSCTEJUVA's major communications and activities have historically been initiated by an amorphous figure known as "The Simulator." The University being the first at which students could specialize in the field of Astronomy, Jefferson toyed with the idea of painting the interior of the Dome Room with images of the night sky to aid the students in their learning. He went so far as to begin designing a new mechanism with which students would be able to "float" through the air and study heavenly bodies from closer different viewpoints. They would also be equipped with a control to move the stars around the Dome. The idea was eventually abandoned but would have been the first planetarium in the United States.
