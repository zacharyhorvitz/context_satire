The fight with the Thor clone rages on as Justice tells Ragnarok that he had worked with the REAL Thor and that Ragnarok is unworthy of that name. After Ragnarok knocks out Rage and Slapstick, Debrii has the Scarlet Spiders hack into Ragnarok. However, Ragnarok kills Michael the Scarlet Spider. Ragnarok is about to vanquish Von Blitzschlag with pure physical force, when the crafty Baron dismisses the notion as futile. In this branch of the legend, the young Mordred later joins Arthur's fellowship of the Round Table after Merlin's downfall. Known for his lustful habits (including even attempted rapes in the French romance Claris et Laris), he is involved in the adventures of his brothers and some of his fellow knights such as Brunor, becoming the killer of Lamorak as well as a friend and companion yet eventually a bitter enemy of Lancelot. His turning point toward evil is hearing an old priest's prophecy for him and Lancelot, revealing his true parentage and predicting their roles in the ruin of the kingdom (the angry Mordred kills the priest before he could warn Arthur). In this narrative, Mordred overthrows Arthur's rule when the latter is engaged in the war against Lancelot. Ragnarok moves on a crash course for Area Zero, and Zero makes his way there to find Weil survived. Weil reveals that he was human, made into a bionic-reploid hybrid by the same people who exiled Omega and himself into space at the end of the Elf Wars. His new body is incapable of aging or dying, as it constantly repairs and upgrades itself. Believing he can survive the impact of the crash and personally oversee the destruction of Area Zero, Weil fuses with the Ragnarok core, and later the remnants of the station itself, and attacks Zero as the final boss.
