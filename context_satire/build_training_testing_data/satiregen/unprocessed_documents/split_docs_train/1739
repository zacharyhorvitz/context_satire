The latest fighters in the opioid addiction epidemic aren't addicts-turned-activists, cops or even addiction counselors. They are health insurance companies. Cigna, which insures about 14 million Americans, has become the latest major health insurance company to take measures to combat the staggering opioid addiction numbers and deaths, targeting what many feel is feeding the problem: overprescribing of prescription painkillers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone and morphine.
