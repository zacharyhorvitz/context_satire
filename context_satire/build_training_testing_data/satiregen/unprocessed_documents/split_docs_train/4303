Moore's self-titled album's third and final single, "Cry," was released on November 4, 2001, to help promote the film. Commenting on the film, she said: "It was my first movie and I know people say it may be cliche and it's a tearjerker or it's cheesy, but for me, it's the thing I'm most proud of." Episode 2: Nick runs onto the sidewalk and Mandy's boyfriend gets out of his car to look for him. He eventually gives up, only to see Nick in a car with his brothers, Joe and Kevin, who drive by laughing. Later that night, Mandy and her boyfriend are at the homecoming dance and are announced as homecoming King and Queen. The Jonases are also there. Moore began starring in a number of local productions, and performing the National Anthem at a number of events in Orlando. She was only twelve years old when she went to the Stagedoor Manor performing arts camp, where other celebrities including actress Natalie Portman had been to. Production director Konnie Kittrell said about Moore "She was a quiet, sweet girl", and said that she earned a number of solos, but "She wasn't a spotlight seeker."
