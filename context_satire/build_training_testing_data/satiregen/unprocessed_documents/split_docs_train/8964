 David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, profited from shares they had in a Panamanian-based trust set up by his late father, the British Prime Minister told CNN affiliate ITV News in an exclusive interview. Cameron, who told ITV he has nothing to hide, said he and his wife had 5,000 shares of Blairmore Investment Trust that they sold in January 2010 for about Â£30,000 (about $42,200 in U.S. dollars at current exchange rates). "I paid (UK) income tax on the dividends. There was a profit on it, but it was less than the capital gains tax allowance, so I didn't pay capital gains tax," he told the British broadcaster.  Well, that didn't take long. Only two days after the release of the Panama Papers, the first head rolled. Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned on Tuesday. Gunnlaugsson had been under pressure to step down since leaked documents hacked from a Panamanian law firm revealed his links to an offshore company, triggering protests.  A new Prime Minister took the reins in Iceland Thursday as fallout over the Panama Papers document leak continued Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, who had been the country's agriculture minister, was sworn in as Prime Minister Thursday afternoon. That came two days after former Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson announced he was stepping down amid mounting protests and calls for his resignation after leaked documents from a Panamanian law firm revealed his links to an offshore company. Panama Papers: 7 things to know Gunnlaugsson's resignation doesn't mean the dust has settled. He will remain head of the Progressive Party, which might not go down well with the throngs of Icelanders who have taken to the streets in protest and want nothing to do with him.
