Dr. Hager rejoined the mission after his marriage with Lizzie Winona Blackman in Chicago on June 20, 1894 and the couple traveled back to China in September of the same year. However, after a very brief stay and service in Canton, Mrs. Hager died on the date of March 7, 1895 primarily due to kidney complaint. It was a sad and heavy stroke to Dr. Hager. Within a few months he was back once more in Hong Kong, and working harder than ever, especially with his "fine art" of country tours. Full Moon: Harold, Sid and Stinky all moon Principal Wartz, but Arnold is blamed, even though he was just an innocent bystander. Student Teacher: Helga's sister Olga comes home for spring break and becomes a classroom aid in Helga's class, much to Helga's chagrin. During his last years, Dr. Hager still labored among the California Chinese, and across the border in Mexico, and frequently sent money to the South China Mission. Dr. Hager died July 13, 1917, at Claremont, California, of cancer of the stomach. He was buried at the Oak Park Cemetery with his second wife, Marie Hager, who died a year later.
