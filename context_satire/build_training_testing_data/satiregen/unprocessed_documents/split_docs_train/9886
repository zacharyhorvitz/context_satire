The Marshall Mathers LP was released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope Records, in the United States, and on 11 September 2000, by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom.

(See List of Leave It to Beaver episodes for specific season opening sequences.) Billingsley was the first to be introduced in all opening sequences, followed by Beaumont and Dow.
