 President Donald Trump has scaled up his demands on NATO allies ahead of a summit next week in Brussels, Belgium. And as he has since he was a candidate, Trump has mostly mischaracterized the spending issue in a way that casts European countries as freeloaders. But even as his statements obscure the way NATO operates, the underlying matter remains one that his predecessors also confronted. And NATO's leaders have already assigned credit to Trump for across-the-board increases in defense spending, even as the number of members reaching the established goal remains small.  President Donald Trump sent letters to the leaders of NATO allies, including Germany, Belgium, Norway and Canada, demanding that they increase their defense spending and threatening to alter the US global military presence if they do not, according to a report in the New York Times on Monday. The letters were sent last month, according to the Times, before a NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium, next week. A source familiar with the letters confirmed their existence to CNN but did not confirm the language in them. A separate diplomatic source briefed on the letters described them as "very tough" and said they requested more defense spending and warned the US was losing patience.  President Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested NATO leaders increase their defense spending to 4% -- doubling the 2% target that many NATO countries have yet to meet. "During the President's remarks today at the NATO summit he suggested that countries not only meet their commitment of 2% of their GDP on defense spending, but that they increase it to 4%," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed in a statement. Sanders said Trump "raised this same issue" at NATO last year. "President Trump wants to see our allies share more of the burden and at a very minimum meet their already stated obligations," Sanders said.
