Cara worked with several producers including Kuya, Malay, Alan Nglish, Fredro, Pop & Oak and Sebastian Kole. The latter helped in the conception of the opening track "Seventeen". The song was written when Cara was about eighteen: "It was a whole bunch of feelings. We got to talking in the studio with my dad and Sebastian — we all came up with this thing, like, let’s write about how life goes by really fast. The rest of Four Pink Walls consist of retro-style soul tracks with Cara's vocals being resemblant to Amy Winehouse. A song about wanting to do anything for someone, including being a runaway with them, "Outlaws" includes bright, "burping" horn stab and tinkling, modern Motown-esque keys backing Cara singing that her boyfriend is "the shine into her star." The most pop-sounding track on the release is "I'm Yours", which was written on a guitar in New Jersey on a curb next to a garbage can. Initially a guitar ballad, Cara said that she had always want to write a happy love song that "that wasn’t nice — kind of like an ’eff you’ love song." The EP closes with the boom bap neo soul title track, noted by Bromwich to be most similar to "Here". Coming up with the idea of the song at the beginning of her career, Cara had written much of it during her increasing popularity: "I didn’t want to wait for the next album or the next project to put it out. I wanted to tell the story while it was happening." The rest of the song was written one day while driving to the studio.
