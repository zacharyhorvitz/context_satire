The organization was founded by Adam Geller, who himself was a Teach For America teacher starting in 2006 after he developed the idea for a blog community when he could not find an appropriate place to create a blog to update family and friends about his experiences. Since starting in 2006, Teach For Us has grown to host more than 1200 blogs written by Teach For America teachers, also called corps members. Teach For America started publicly recognizing Teach For Us as an independent source of information about the program starting in 2008 and acknowledges the site from its homepage and several sub-pages. USA Today reported that in March 2009, Peter Gorman, the superintendent of Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina schools told board members that because of a commitment made to the program, 100 Teach For America teachers would be retained in spite of the fact that hundreds of other non-Teach For America teachers in the district would be laid off. However, Teach For America spokeswoman Kerci Marcello Stroud says it would be a mistaken notion to say that Teach For America corps members are displacing experienced teachers. "In every region where we send teachers, we're just one source," she says. "Once they land, corps members must interview for jobs just like everyone else." Teach For Armenia was founded in 2013 by Larisa Hovannisian after her two-year teaching experience in an elementary and middle school in Glendale, Arizona through the Teach For America program. Together with its supporters, Teach For Armenia's founding team embarked on an ambitious mission to transform the country's public education system so that educational excellence and opportunity would reach every child, even the most marginalized.
