Politically, Pratt has stated that he does not feel represented by either side of the political spectrum and has expressed a desire to find common ground. Pratt donated over $1,000 to Barack Obama's 2012 campaign. Pratt was a co-executive producer and a writer on the Quantum Leap TV series which was created by her then-husband, Donald Bellisario. Pratt also frequently starred in the show as both the narrator, and the voice of "Ziggy". In 1999, Pratt purchased the 200,000-acre Three Forks Ranch in northwest Colorado to raise cattle. He has since spent more than $100 million turning the ranch into a luxury hunting and fishing resort, Allison Pratt, Three Forks' marketing director, told Forbes magazine in 2010. “My father wanted to create something people would never expect in this corner of the world,” she said.
