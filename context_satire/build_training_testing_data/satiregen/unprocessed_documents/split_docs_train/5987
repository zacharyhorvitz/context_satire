On March 27, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont called for Clinton to withdraw from the presidential campaign and support opponent Barack Obama. The six-term senator, and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee made the statements during an interview on Vermont Public Radio. Leahy stated: "Senator Clinton has every right, but not a very good reason, to remain a candidate for as long as she wants to. As far as the delegate count and the interests of a Democratic victory in November go, there is not a very good reason for drawing this out."  Allies of Hillary Clinton are calling out Bernie Sanders for snapping at the former secretary of state in a pair of tense exchanges during the Democratic presidential debate on Sunday night in Flint, Michigan. "Excuse me, I'm talking," Sanders told Clinton as she attempted to interrupt his argument about the Wall Street and auto bailouts. Correct the Record, an independent group that backs Clinton's campaign, emailed the clip to reporters, describing it as Sanders' "Rick Lazio moment." That's a reference to former New York senate candidate Rick Lazio, then a Republican congressman, who in a 2000 debate with Clinton walked across the stage demanding she sign a campaign finance reform pledge.  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders waged an acrimonious debate duel Wednesday, throwing punches on immigration reform, auto bailouts and health care as they drew up fresh battle lines ahead of crucial primaries next week that could dictate how long their quest for the Democratic nomination will last. Clinton returned to her attack on Sanders for opposing the auto bailout. She noted that in December 2008, she and Sanders voted to support rescue for Detroit that was blocked by Republicans. But before President Barack Obama took office in 2009, the bailout was folded into a bailout bill for financial firms.
