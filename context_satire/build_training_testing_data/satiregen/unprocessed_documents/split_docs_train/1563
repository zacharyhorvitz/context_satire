Mark (?-September 18, 1755) (sometimes called Mark Codman) was an African-American man enslaved by John Codman (1696-1755) of Massachusetts in the Boston area  before the American Revolutionary War. Though some texts refer to Mark as "Mark Codman", he was probably not referred to as such during his life as giving a slave the surname of his master was not commonly done with New England slaves. The contemporary documents from the investigation and trial only use Mark for his name.Mark was a slave to Codman for a few years before his execution. He was accused of burning down a building about 6 years before his death to try to gain freedom. In the early 1990s, Keith went to Nashville, Tennessee, where he hung out and busked on Music Row and at a place called Houndogs. He distributed copies of a demo tape the band had made to the many record companies in the city. There was no interest by any of the record labels, and Keith returned home feeling depressed. He had promised himself and God to have a recording contract by the time he was 30 years old or give up on music as a career. Keith was born in Clinton, Oklahoma, to Carolyn Joan (n√©e Ross) and Hubert K. Covel, Jr. and is of English ancestry. He has a sister and a brother. The family lived in Fort Smith, Arkansas, for a few years when Keith was in grade school, but moved to Moore, Oklahoma (a suburb of Oklahoma City), when he was still young. Before the family moved to Moore, he visited his grandmother in Fort Smith during the summers.
