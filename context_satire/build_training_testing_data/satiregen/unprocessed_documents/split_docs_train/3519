In 1994, Edmondson wrote a letter to the then President of RadioShack, Leonard H. Roberts. In the letter he wrote that he had an idea that he would like to share, and asked Roberts for 15 minutes of his time. Roberts agreed to a meeting in early February and halfway through Edmondson's presentation, Roberts stopped the conversation and offered him a job by asking "What do I have to do to get you to join this company?" When Edmondson expressed his lack of interest in joining RadioShack, Roberts let the subject drop, but remained intrigued with Edmondson's idea. Despite the internal skepticism, RadioShack aggressively entered the market. The company advertised "The $599 personal computer" as "the most important, useful, exciting, electronic product of our time". Kornfeld stated when announcing the TRS-80, "This device is inevitably in the future of everyone in the civilized world—in some way—now and so far as ahead as one can think", and Tandy's 1977 annual report called the computer "probably the most important product we've ever built in a company factory". Unlike competitor Commodore—which had announced the PET several months earlier but had not yet shipped any—Tandy had its own factories (capable of producing 18,000 computers a month) and distribution network, and even small towns had RadioShack stores. RadioShack and the Better Business Bureau of Fort Worth, Texas met on April 23, 2009 to discuss unanswered and unresolved complaints. The company implemented a plan of action to address existing and future customer service issues. Stores were directed to post a sign with the district manager's name, the question "How Are We Doing?" and a direct toll-free number to the individual district office for their area.
