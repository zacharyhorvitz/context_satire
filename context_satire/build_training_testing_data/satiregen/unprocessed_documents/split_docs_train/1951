According to Jeffrey Lockwood, author of Six-Legged Soldiers (a book about EW), the earliest incident of entomological warfare was probably the use of bees by early humans. The bees or their nests were thrown into caves to force the enemy out and into the open. Lockwood theorizes that the Ark of the Covenant may have been deadly when opened because it contained deadly fleas. In March 1886 the society began publishing the Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington. Of the dozens of entomological societies that have existed for varying periods, only three in the Americas having continued uninterrupted publication of their periodicals are older than the Entomological Society of Washington. The American Entomological Society was founded on March 1, 1859. It is the oldest continuously operating entomology society in the Western Hemisphere, and one of the oldest scientific societies in the United States. It is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The society publishes Entomological News, Transactions of the American Entomological Society, and Memoirs of the American Entomological Society.
