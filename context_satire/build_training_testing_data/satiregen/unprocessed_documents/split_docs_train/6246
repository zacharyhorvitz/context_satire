 We're wrapping up our live coverage after a scrappy televised debate in which both sides can claim to have taken something from. Boris Johnson succeeded in making absolutely, undeniably, crystal clear that he has a Brexit deal secured with the EU. The problem was his repeated "get Brexit done" mantra wore on the audience, and helpfully highlighted for Labour that the Prime Minister is reluctant to talk about much beyond the B-word. Corbyn, meanwhile, was surprisingly unprepared to tackle Johnson's repeated question about how he would campaign in a second Brexit referendum, which is forming the central tenant of the Conservative post-debate spin.  We're closing our election live blog for today, but we'll be back tomorrow when Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn go head-to-head in the first TV debate of the campaign. Catch up on the day's developments below. The Liberal Democrats and the SNP have lost a High Court challenge against their exclusion from Tuesday's TV debate. Tomorrow's broadcast on ITV will see Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn go head to head, but the decision to leave out other parties had infuriated Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon. Caro continues in his analysis that Robert Kennedy tried to get Johnson to agree to be the Democratic Party chairman rather than vice president. Johnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from John Kennedy. Despite his brother's interference, John Kennedy was firm that Johnson was who he wanted as running mate; he met with staffers such as Larry O'Brien, his national campaign manager, to say that Johnson was to be vice president. O'Brien recalled later that John Kennedy's words were wholly unexpected, but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation, he thought "it was a stroke of genius".
