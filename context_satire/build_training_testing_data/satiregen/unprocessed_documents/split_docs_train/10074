The new dock was not an immediate success, used by just four vessels in its first year of operation; however, by 1900 this number had grown to 170 and the future appeared rosy. The creation of the Preston Dock Branch Line railway in the 1840s, and later extensions in the 1890s and 1920s, allowed goods to be transported directly to and from ships, minimising loading and unloading times and providing the Port of Preston with a competitive advantage over other nearby ports. However, ever with the new deeper navigation channel there was still an ongoing issue of the river's shallowness which not only limited vessels' journeys but also restricted the mooring of increasingly larger vessels to the new Victoria Quays (which was by 1860 had only been in operation for 35 years) and in 1861 the Preston discussed a proposal to locate the docks away from the river in deep-water basin with a constant level maintained by a series of locks. Nothing came to be from this proposal until 1882 when the corporation voted to adopt this as their strategy for their town's future port. In 1883, Parliament passed the Preston Dock Act to allow construction of the new docks. In 1884 construction began with the diversion of the River Ribble and the excavation of the new basin, with the first sod being turned on 11 October 1884. Preston is one of several people referred to as the "Fifth Beatle". At one point during the Get Back sessions, John Lennon proposed the idea of having him join the band (to which Paul McCartney countered that it was difficult enough reaching agreements with four). Preston played organ and electric piano for the Beatles during several of the Get Back sessions; some of these sessions appeared in the film Let it Be and on its companion album. Preston also accompanied the band on electric piano for its rooftop concert, the group's final public appearance.
