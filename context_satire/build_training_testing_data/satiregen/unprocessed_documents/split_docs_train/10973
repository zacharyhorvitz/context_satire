 Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley says he has yet to hear back from Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of committing sexual and physical assault while they were both in high school. Tuesday morning, Grassley told Hugh Hewitt on his radio show that Ford has not accepted his request to appear before the committee. "We have reached out to her in the last 36 hours, three or four times, by email, and we have not heard from them," Grassley said. "So it kind of raises the question, do they want to come to the public hearing or not?"  Christine Blasey Ford will tell the Senate that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault on her in their high school years stayed with her for her whole life, according to prepared testimony for Thursday's hearing. Ford, in her testimony, is due to make clear she has no uncertainty about the identity of her alleged attacker, referring to Kavanaugh as "the boy who sexually assaulted me." "I don't have all the answers, and I don't remember as much as I would like to," Ford said. "But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget.  Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh said in written testimony for Thursday's hearing with a woman accusing him of sexual assault that he is facing a barrage of "last-minute smears." "There has been a frenzy to come up with something -- anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious -- that will block a vote on my nomination," Kavanaugh's testimony said. The Senate Judiciary Committee released the testimony Kavanaugh submitted a day ahead of his scheduled appearance before the hearing on an accusation brought by Christine Blasey Ford, who has said he sexually assaulted her at a party in their high school years. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation along with accusations from others who have gone public since Ford.
