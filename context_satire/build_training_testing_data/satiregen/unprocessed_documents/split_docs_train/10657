 During her CNN town hall Tuesday night, Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York addressed a question on gun control and her personal shift from receiving an A-rating by the National Rifle Association during her time as a member of the House of Representatives to the F-rating she maintains as a senator. In her answer, Gillibrand went after the NRA. "Let's be really clear what the issue is. It's the NRA, and it's greed.  The House voted Thursday to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, but the bill faces an unlikely future in the Senate where negotiators are working on their own version. The vote was 263-158, with 33 Republicans joining Democrats to pass it. The law lapsed earlier this year after Democrats declined to extend it, wanting to pass their own reauthorization for another five years instead. VAWA programs, though, are technically still being funded. In February 2018 a school shooting at a high school in Florida left 17 dead and another 17 injured, and student survivors organized a movement called Never Again MSD to demand passage of certain gun control measures. Many of the students blamed the NRA, and the politicians who accept money from the organization, for preventing enactment of any gun control proposals after previous high-profile shootings. An NRA spokesman responded by blaming the shooting on the FBI and the media. The NRA also issued a statement that the incident was proof that more guns were immediately required in schools in the hands of a bolstered force of armed security personnel in order to "harden" them against any further similar assaults.
