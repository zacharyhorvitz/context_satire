After guitar player Justin Rimer got a job at the famous Ardent Studios in Memphis, he became an assistant engineer for such then-emerging acts as 3 Doors Down and Train. Rimmer's time at Ardent led to Broken getting a "spec" (sic) deal at the studio. The result of that deal was the original "Coming of Age", an 8-track demo record that was later the basis for Wind-Up to sign the band. Of the record's 8 tracks, five were later remixed and used on the band's debut L.P also titled "Coming of Age". In 1981, he left touring with Zappa to become a studio musician, recording for the band Pages and pop singer Gino Vannelli. Opportunities arose with saxophonist Tom Scott and bassist Larry Klein, who invited Colaiuta to play on a record by his then-girlfriend, Joni Mitchell. When Klein and Mitchell got married, Colaiuta was the best man at their wedding. During the 1980s, he toured with Mitchell. Mrs Barbauld once told me that she admired The Ancient Mariner very much, but that there were two faults in it -- it was improbable, and had no moral. As for the probability, I owned that that might admit some question; but as to the want of a moral, I told her that in my own judgement the poem had too much; and that the only, or chief fault, if I might say so, was the obtrusion of the moral sentiment so openly on the reader as a principle or cause of action in a work of such pure imagination. It ought to have had no more moral than the Arabian Nights' tale of the merchant's sitting down to eat dates by the side of a well, and throwing the shells aside, and lo! a genie starts up, and says he must kill the aforesaid merchant, because one of the date shells had, it seems, put out the eye of the genie's son.
