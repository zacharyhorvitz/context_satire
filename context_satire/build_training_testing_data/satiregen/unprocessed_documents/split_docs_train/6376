The 1985 Bears were not the first pro football team with a group song. The 1984 San Francisco 49ers put out a record during that season, one in which they also went on to become Super Bowl champs. The song, "We Are the 49ers," was in the vein of post-disco/80's dance-pop music. Later in the 1980s, the 49ers would put out another team song titled "49ers Rap." "The Super Bowl Shuffle" is a rap song performed by players of the Chicago Bears football team in 1985. It was released December 3, 1985 and recorded the day after their only loss of the season at the hands of the Miami Dolphins, two months prior to their win in Super Bowl XX over the New England Patriots. It peaked at No. 41 in February 1986 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Dennis Louis Gentry (born February 10, 1959) is a former professional American football player who was selected by the Chicago Bears in the 4th round of the 1982 NFL Draft. He spent his entire 11-year NFL career with the Bears from 1982 to 1992, and was a part of the Bears team that was victorious in Super Bowl XX versus the New England Patriots. He was also a member of the "Chicago Bears Shufflin' Crew" in the video "The Super Bowl Shuffle," which featured him pantomiming on the bass.
