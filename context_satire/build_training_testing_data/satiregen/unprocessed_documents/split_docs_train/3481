AirAsia is the first foreign airline to set up a subsidiary in India and the company marked Tata Group's return to the aviation industry after 60 years, having ceded Air India in 1946. As of December 2019, AirAsia India was the 5th largest carrier in India, after IndiGo, SpiceJet, Air India and GoAir, with a market share of 7.0%. Ghodawat Enterprises, the parent company of Star Air, sought permission from the Central Government in March 2017 to establish a scheduled passenger airline called Star Air. The airline acquired its first aircraft, an Embraer 145LR, in June 2018. It obtained its Air Operator's Certificate in early January of the following year and announced that it would operate flights under the Central Government's UDAN scheme, which aims to improve regional connectivity within India. Kempegowda International Airport in Bangalore was selected as the base of operations. AirAsia India was established on 28 March 2013 and became the first foreign airline to set up a subsidiary in India. In April, the airline started recruiting candidates for pilots and cabin crew. As the final procedure to obtain Air Operator Permit, a proving flight was conducted on 1 and 2 May 2014 flying from Chennai to Kochi, Bangalore and Kolkata. On 7 May 2014, the DGCA issued an Air Operator Permit to the company.
