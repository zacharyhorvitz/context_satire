I had to really have a sit back and just look at what I was doing with myself outside the octagon and inside. I had made changes, I had lost way of who I was as fighter and as a family man and as a man myself and just sitting back and reflecting on that I had to make my relationship with my family right and then I had to make my relationship with my coaches and everything right. Whittaker appeared for the first time as the Thirteenth Doctor at the end of the 2017 Christmas special, "Twice Upon a Time", and stars as the Doctor from 2018, starting with the programme's eleventh series. She continues in the role in the twelfth series in 2020, and will continue on in the thirteenth series. Whittaker stated that she worked with the show's costume designer Ray Holman (who had also worked before with Whittaker on Broadchurch) to come up with her outfit, inspired by a photograph that she had found online. The photograph had been published in a 1988 issue of Sassy showing a number of female models in men's clothing, with the specific photo of a woman in trousers, braces and a T-shirt, walking with a purpose. Whittaker said she "just love the androgyny of it, without it being masculine", and that "felt intriguing and kind of open to interpretation and I really love that". Additional elements drew out from the photograph.
