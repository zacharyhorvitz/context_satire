 Arcane bylaws, unbound superdelegates, closed primaries, 10-second speeches at state party conventions -- Is this really how democracy works? The vagaries of the American political party primary system are on full, often confounding display this election season as outsider candidates like Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, with their bursting rallies and vocal grassroots support, struggle with the fine print of American politics. Constitutional wonks will be quick to note the U.S. is not a "direct," but rather a "representative democracy" -- meaning there is, be it in electing presidents or passing laws, a legally enshrined buffer between the will of the people and political outcomes. Founding father and future President John Adams warned that bad or selfish decisions by the masses could lead to a "tyranny of the majority." The meaning of the word American in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. American is derived from America, a term originally denoting all of the New World (also called the Americas). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the United States of America. In modern English, American generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification. Georgetown is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institution of higher education in the United States. The Jesuits have participated in the university's academic life, both as scholars and as administrators, since 1805. However, the university has always been governed independently of the church, and the majority of Georgetown students are not Catholic.
