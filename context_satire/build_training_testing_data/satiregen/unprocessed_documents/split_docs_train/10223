 There were 762 murders in Chicago in 2016. It was the deadliest year in nearly two decades. Here's how we got to this point, what it means for the city and those whose lives have been changed forever. WHAT 762 MEANS The number alone doesn't tell the entire story of Chicago's bloodshed.  Some time in May 2014, Paul Overby, an American writer in his 70's, disappeared as he was traveling between Khost in Afghanistan and North Waziristan in Pakistan -- a region rife with the Taliban and terror groups such as al Qaeda. He has not been heard from since. On Wednesday, his wife went public for the first time with his disappearance, providing a statement to CNN and other media outlets. Overby's wife, who asked not to be identified by name, last heard from her husband on May 16, 2014, as he was preparing to cross the border into Pakistan. On August 17, 2016, Libyan officials announced that, a few days earlier, they had capturedv an individual named Moez Ben Abdulgader Ben Ahmed Al Fezzani, who was reported as being a "top ISIS leader", and Tunisia's "most wanted terrorist". On August 20, 2016, some American media, including Fox News, reported that the captured man was an individual formerly held in Guantanamo.
