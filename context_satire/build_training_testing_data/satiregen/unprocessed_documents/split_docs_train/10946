On 10 March, a 24-year-old Vietnamese woman was announced positive with the virus and had close contact with case #17 while in London. After she acknowledged that case #17 was infected, she flew back to Vietnam in a private jet with quarantined cabin to seek healthcare in her home country. Later that day, another British man was found infected with the virus, who was on the same flight with case #17. Nguyễn's mother was his father's third wife, noted for her ability at singing and composing poetry. In fact, she made her living by singing, which at that time was considered a disreputable occupation. It is said that Nguyễn may have inherited a part of his talents from his mother. He loved listening to traditional songs; and there was a rumor that, when he was 18, he himself eloped with a songstress. Typically, Vietnamese will be addressed with their given name, even in formal situations, although an honorific equivalent to "Mr.", "Mrs.", etc. will be added when necessary. That contrasts with the situation in many other cultures in which the family name is used in formal situations, but it is a practice similar to usage in Icelandic usage and, to some degree, Polish. It is similar to the Latin-American and southern European custom of referring to women as "Doña" and men as "Don", along with their first name.
