In Season 2, the family settles in New York City as Nate finds a new career but more trouble as pieces of Robin's past resurface, including her relationship with her father, wanted felon J.R. Randall (James Cromwell). The framing device presents the couple being interrogated by the United States Postal Inspection Service as an attempt to get at J.R., led by the overzealous (and very pregnant) Agent Edie (Laura Benanti). On July 29, 2011, Parise signed a one-year contract worth $6 million with the Devils. On October 5, 2011, the Devils named him captain. Parise became the second captain in Devils history (the other being Scott Stevens) to lead them to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Devils were down 0â€“3 in the series before finally losing in six games at the hands of the Los Angeles Kings. In 1866, Bishop Whipple opened a school for girls, St. Mary's Hall, in his home in downtown Faribault. The girls remained there until 1872 when the bishop moved to a new house and St. Mary's Hall was turned over to a board of trustees. By 1883, St. Mary's had also outgrown its downtown facilities, and a grand, ornate building, often referred to as "the Castle on the Rhine," was built on the bluffs, less than a half mile south of Shattuck. That unique building burned in 1924, and the limestone structure that stands today was built less than a year later.
