 1. Disney streaming: Investors are about to learn a lot more about Disney's new streaming product. The entertainment giant is expected to show off its Disney+ streaming service during its investors day on Thursday. It's Disney's answer to the challenge posed by Netflix as well as tech giants like Amazon and Google.  J Crew's sales have fallen for four straight years and the privately-held company is $1.7 billion in debt. But the retailer's Madewell brand has been a growth machine. On Thursday, J Crew said it's exploring spinning off the brand as separate public company. An IPO for Madwell could come as early as the back half of 2019.
