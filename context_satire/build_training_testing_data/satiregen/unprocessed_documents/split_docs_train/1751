Amy Gray (Amy Brenneman), an attorney and Harvard graduate, moves back to her hometown of Hartford, Connecticut after separating from her husband Michael in New York City. She and her six-year-old daughter Lauren (Karle Warren) move in with her widowed mother, Maxine Gray (Tyne Daly) who is a caseworker for the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. The move back to Hartford also reunites Amy with her two brothers. Her older brother Peter (Marcus Giamatti) juggles the operations of their late father's insurance company along with the struggles he and his wife Gillian (Jessica Tuck) are facing towards starting a family due to fertility issues. Though Karen Morley was under contract at MGM, Hawks was close with MGM studio executive Eddie Mannix, who loaned out Morley for the film. She was reportedly given the choice between the role of Poppy or Cesca. Though Cesca was the stronger role, she chose Poppy as she felt Cesca would be a better fit for her friend Ann Dvorak. She considered this "probably the nicest thing  did in  life". According to a 1981 profile in People, Hamill's "first serious love" was co-actor Anne Wyndham, cast as his sister on General Hospital, with whom he had an offscreen relationship. Hamill would later describe experiencing seasons of on-set tension while working with her after their relationship ended. In a 2017 interview, Hamill attributed his long, happy marriage to a non-actor to learning, through his relationship with Wyndham, the danger of being competitive when in a relationship with a fellow actor.
