The new "middle school" model began to appear in the mid-1960s. Wiles said, "At first, it was difficult to determine the difference between a junior high school and a middle school, but as the middle school became established, the differences became more pronounced". Middle School is in between elementary school and high school, and has 6 to 8th graders. Junior High schools are preparing seventh, eighth, and ninth grade students for High School. This would lead to the introduction of a newer, slimmer 10.1-inch model at the Samsung Unpacked Event during CTIA Wireless Convention in March 2011, together with an 8.9 inch model, pushing the release date further to 8 June for the US release and "early summer" for the latter model. Although there was no information about a delay of the European release date, it was announced that the previous design, seen at the Mobile World Congress, would be sold relabelled as "Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1v".
