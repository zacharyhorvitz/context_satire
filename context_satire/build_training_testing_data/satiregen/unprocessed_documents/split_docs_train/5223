 The early Friday release of "The Dark Knight Rises" was one of the most eagerly anticipated movie events of the summer. On Thursday, movie ticket seller Fandango reported that the last installment in the Christopher Nolan-directed Batman trilogy was "outpacing summer blockbuster 'The Avengers' in ticket sales at the same point in the sales cycle." "The final chapter of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy has sold out on Fandango more than 2,000 showtimes nationwide and it's currently on track to become one of Fandango's top-selling movies of all time," the ticket seller reported. An attack by an armed gunman in Aurora, Colorado, at a midnight screening of  "The Dark Knight Rises" was met with shock and grief throughout the country, and cast a shadow over what for fans was set to be a blockbuster weekend. Hours before the midnight release, several box office analysts suggested as much as a $198 million domestic opening weekend.

Editor's note: This story may contain spoilers Warner Brothers studios confirmed Friday that it will not cancel any screenings of "The Dark Knight Rises," squashing any rumors that it might dial back the release following the mass shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, theater.
