 Voters at Sunday night's town hall debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will undoubtedly have questions for the Republican nominee over recently surfaced lewd remarks he made, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine says. "I don't exactly know what she is going to say about it during the debate," Clinton's running mate told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview that aired Sunday on "State of the Union." "I think it's time for Donald Trump to answer and take responsibility." The town hall debate, which will be moderated by CNN's Anderson Cooper and ABC's Martha Raddatz, will have 100 undecided voters in attendance who will have the opportunity to ask questions of the candidates.  His campaign on the ropes, Donald Trump came out in the second presidential debate throwing verbal haymakers at Hillary Clinton. The Sunday night showdown in St. Louis had been billed as the Republican nominee's last, best chance to stop the bleeding and put Clinton back on her heels. And from the open, he blitzed Clinton with a series of barbed attacks and a jarring threat. Here were Trump's most pointed attacks -- and Clinton's rejoinders.  Donald Trump will have 90 minutes Sunday night to save his presidential campaign, as he faces off against Hillary Clinton in a debate that will cap one of the most extraordinary weekends in American political history. Republicans -- including vice presidential nominee Mike Pence -- are criticizing Trump for his vulgar comments about advances he has made toward women that came to light Friday. And an ever-growing list of senators and top GOP officials want Trump replaced on the ticket. Trump insists he won't leave the race, and he and allies (those that remain, at least) indicate he'll go on the attack against Clinton.
