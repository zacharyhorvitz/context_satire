Shortly after, Hyde, released on a $500,000 bond, phones Ana demanding a ransom for Mia, Christian's abducted sister. Hyde demands $5,000,000 in cash in two hours and threatens to kill Mia if his demands aren't met. He warns Ana to tell no one and to bring the money alone. Ana takes a checkbook and revolver from Christianâ€™s desk then goes to the bank to withdraw the full amount. Ana awakens three days later in the hospital with Christian at her side. Though angry at Ana's recklessness and still anxious about fatherhood, Christian realizes how important their baby is to her, and they reconcile. Christian's adoptive mother, Grace, assures Christian that Ana will not leave him. Ana returns home the next day. Now as a man is like this or like that,according as he acts and according as he behaves, so will he be;a man of good acts will become good, a man of bad acts, bad;he becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds;And here they say that a person consists of desires,and as is his desire, so is his will;and as is his will, so is his deed;and whatever deed he does, that he will reap.
