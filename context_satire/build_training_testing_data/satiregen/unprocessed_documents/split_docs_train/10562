In 1980, dismayed by what he saw as the abject failure of the Jimmy Carter presidency (he would later say "he was the worst president we ever had"), he appeared in a campaign ad for Libertarian candidate Ed Clark, and also wrote the introduction to Clark's campaign book. He eventually endorsed Ronald Reagan for the presidency. In 1867 Clark sent his daughter Susan to a local public school in Muscatine, where she was refused admission  due to her race. Muscatine had a separate school for blacks, but it was located about a mile from their house. In addition, Clark thought the quality of the instructors there was low. He sued the school board in 1868 for the right of his daughter to attend her local school. The first season follows the aftermath of a costly high school prank that left 27 faculty cars vandalized with phallic images. Senior class clown Dylan Maxwell is accused of the crime by the school. He is expelled, but an investigation into the incident is launched by sophomore Peter Maldonado, with help from his friend Sam Ecklund, to uncover whether Dylan was the one truly behind the crime.
