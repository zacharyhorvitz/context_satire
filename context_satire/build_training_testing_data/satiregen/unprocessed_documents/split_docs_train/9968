While being interviewed during Fire and Fury's publicity tour Wolff told Bill Maher that he was "absolutely sure" President Trump was having an affair, and said that a close reading of his book could reveal who his partner was. Based on a passage from Fire and Fury, some observers believed this was a reference to Nikki Haley, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Haley denied Wolff's allegations, calling it "disgusting" and "absolutely not true". Erik Wemple of the Washington Post said that Wolff was engaging in a "remarkable multimedia slime job". With All Due Respect: Defending America with Grit and Grace is a memoir by Nikki Haley about her years as United States Ambassador to the United Nations. It was published by St. Martin's Press on November 12, 2019. The title comes from a comment she made to Fox News â€“ "With all due respect, I don't get confused". In December 2018, it was reported by several news organizations that along with the nomination of Heather Nauert to replace Nikki Haley, the Trump administration would once again downgrade the position to non-Cabinet rank.
