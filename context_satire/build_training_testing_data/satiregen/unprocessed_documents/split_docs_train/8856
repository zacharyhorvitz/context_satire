Exactly two years after the flight Doug Hughes mailed the letters to Congress, conventionally at the Post Office he previously worked at. The letters had been impounded as evidence - Hughes recovered them after he finished his prison term. Within the limits of his probation, which limits his travel, he is active with other leaders in the movement to get big money out of politics. Andy learns that a document Christian has asked Doug to sign was intended to permit the billionaire to take over the hotel project and force Doug out. Christian reveals that an IRS agent who was tailing Doug about the real estate property he (Doug) bought until he (Christian) and his lawyers took care of it was actually working with Christian to get the property. Christian smugly tells Andy that the project was going to make a fortune and he wasn't going to share it with a mere concierge. Andy abandons him for Doug, who is chasing after her.
