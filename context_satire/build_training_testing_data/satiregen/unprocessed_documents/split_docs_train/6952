 Violence and the resulting displaced people have created a crisis in Mali that is the worst in its recent history, a new report by Amnesty International says. Fighting in northern Mali has resulted in hundreds of thousands of displaced people, the human rights organization said. Many have been subjected to arbitrary detention, extrajudicial executions or sexual violence, the report found. Since the beginning of 2012, the report found, Mali has faced a situation that has "questioned both the integrity of its territory as well as almost 20 years of political stability."  It's graduation day and professor Jonathan Jansen strolls around the campus of the University of the Free State. Every now and then he stops to greet his gown-clad students, standing out amid a crowd of beaming parents and proudly grinning teachers. As rector of the formerly all-white educational institution in Bloemfontein, South Africa, Jansen is about to use his graduation ceremony speech to teach his students one last lesson. "I urge you, in a country where there's still a lot of rage, never respond by rage, respond through reason and you will have gotten not just a degree, but an education," says Jansen, looking into the eyes of his students.  Voters in Algeria went to the polls Thursday to choose members of parliament. About 25,000 candidates from 44 political parties are competing for 462 seats in the National People's Assembly. Roughly 15 percent of voters turned out, according to the Algerian Press Service. About 500 international observers were on hand to monitor the voting in Algeria, a North African nation of 37 million plagued by high unemployment.
