The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) is the successor to the erstwhile Corporate Law Authority (CLA), which was an attached department of the Ministry of Finance. The process of the CLA's restructuring was started in 1997 under the Capital Market Development Plan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The parliament passed the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan Act, which was promulgated in December 1997. Consequently, the SECP, having an autonomous status, became operational on January 1, 1999. BSEC was established on 8 June 1993 under the Securities and Exchange Commission Act, 1993. The Chairman and Members of the Commission are appointed by the government and have overall responsibility to administer securities legislation. The Commission, at present has three full-time members, excluding the Chairman. The Commission is a statutory body and attached to the Ministry of Finance.
