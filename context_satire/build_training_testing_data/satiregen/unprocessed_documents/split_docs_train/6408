LaHood announced his plans to step down as transportation secretary at the end of Obama's first term in 2013. He did not seek any public office after that, and instead entered the private sector. On January 29, 2013, LaHood announced he would resign as the Secretary of the Department of Transportation upon the confirmation of his successor by the United States Senate. President Obama nominated Anthony Foxx, the incumbent mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, to succeed LaHood.  Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, the lone Republican in President Barack Obama's Cabinet, is leaving the administration, a White House official said Tuesday. The departure of LaHood is the latest of several changes in Obama's administration since the president won re-election in November. LaHood, 67, was named transportation secretary in January 2009. Before that, he served seven terms in the U.S. House as a representative from Illinois. On December 19, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama announced that he would nominate LaHood to be the next Transportation Secretary. LaHood served on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee from 1995 to 2000. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee he won praise for his "skills as an arbiter" in being able to bridge sometimes bitter partisan divides in the Congress, something the position would require. Some critics alleged a reputation for pork barrel spending, including in support of campaign contributors.
