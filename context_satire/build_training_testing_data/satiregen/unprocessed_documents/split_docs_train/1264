Denny was an ascetic, a devout Christian (conservative in his religion to the point of opposing a divorce law), and a lifelong teetotaler. Indeed, he was teetotal to the point where he had the customers of his store buy their liquor direct from visiting ship captains so that he would not be involved in the transactions. He was a political conservative, and a cautious and conservative businessman and investor. Denny, in his memoir, described his decision to head north from Portland to Puget Sound as a "desperate venture". By the Georgian era, Lincoln's fortunes began to pick up, thanks in part to the Agricultural Revolution. The re-opening of the Foss Dyke canal allowed coal and other raw materials vital to industry to be  brought into the city more easily. Denny, California, refers to two little mining settlements named Denny that were and are located in northwestern Trinity County, one in the upper New River watershed within the Trinity Alps Wilderness Area and the other twenty miles downstream along a one-way county roadway.The first Denny, now called Old Denny on maps, originated with two other little towns close to it—White Rock City and Marysville—in September 1884 when the area was populated with hard rock (lode) gold miners. Its name for the first few years was New River City and then was changed to Denny from A.H. Denny who maintained a store there as well as other stores over the ridges in Siskiyou County. (Denny never lived at the place that adopted his name, however.) As time went on the gold profits went down, people were leaving to find other places to live, and by 1920 brothers Grover and Willard Ladd began homesteading a 160-acre ranch where the new Denny would be located, twenty miles down the trail.
