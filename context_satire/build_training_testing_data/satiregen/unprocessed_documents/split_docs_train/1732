 By Donna Krache, CNN (CNN) -- A recently released study by the Brookings Institution at Harvard has stirred up the debate over school choice and vouchers. In some districts and states, parents can get vouchers to pay for their childrenâ€™s education. Parents may choose to send their children to religious or private schools using the vouchers as payment for tuition. Much of the research surrounding the effectiveness of vouchers centers on more immediate outcomes, such as test scores. Americans are nationals and citizens of the United States of America. Although nationals and citizens make up the majority of Americans, some dual citizens, expatriates, and permanent residents may also claim American nationality. The United States is home to people of many different ethnic origins. As a result, American culture and law does not equate nationality with race or ethnicity, but with citizenship and permanent allegiance.  Mitt Romney says that after more than three years of a Barack Obama presidency, the United States is uncharacteristically pessimistic about the future of its children. The GOP presidential nominee said Thursday at the Republican National Convention that America's immigrants would always arrive confident that they could build a better life, and "that in America their children would be more blessed than they." "But today, four years from the excitement of the last election, for the first time, the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future," Romney said. Fact Check: Trimming the Pentagon The facts: Polls do appear to show a recent, downward trend in optimism for kids' futures, and four polls from two different organizations since 2009 indeed had a majority of adult respondents saying they don't expect today's children to be better off than their parents.
