 Chelsea Clinton will introduce her mother ahead of her Thursday night nomination acceptance speech with remarks she has been writing "for a couple weeks," her spokeswoman, Erika Gudmunson, said Tuesday. It will come a week after her friend, Ivanka Trump, introduced her father at the Republican National Convention to much fanfare. For Chelsea Clinton, it's a responsibility that Gudmunson said the mother of two is taking more seriously than any speech she has ever given before. "While she had a similar role in 2008, she's been reflecting in particular on what this moment means now -- not just as her mother's daughter but also now as a mom herself," Gudmunson said.  Watch out, "Make America Great Again," the delegates at the Republican National Convention are warming up to a new favorite slogan: "Lock her up." For a second night in a row, delegates on the floor of the convention chanted the phrase, directed toward presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who they say should face charges for setting up a private email server for official state business. The chant, which delegates began on the first night of the convention Monday, was revived again Tuesday when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie began a speech by making a case against Clinton.  Hillary Clinton officially won the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday. Then, Bill Clinton took the Democratic National Convention on a 45-minute tour through the former first lady, senator and secretary of state's biography. "In the spring of 1971," he began, "I met a girl." Bill Clinton's case for Hillary Clinton as a "change-maker" headlined the convention's second day.
