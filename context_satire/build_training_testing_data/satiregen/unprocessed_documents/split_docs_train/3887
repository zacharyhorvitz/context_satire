 China accused the Trump administration of committing "economic terrorism" on Thursday, escalating its war of words with the United States amid rising trade tensions between the two countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the White House had "brought huge damage to the economy of other countries and the US itself," spokesperson Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing on Thursday. Lu described US trade policy as "typical economic terrorism, economic hegemonism, and economic unilateralism." The statement followed similarly ominous rhetoric from Chinese state media, which issued a stern message to Washington on Wednesday: "Don't say we didn't warn you."  Robert Downey Jr. is vowing to save the Earth the only way Iron Man knows how: with artificial intelligence. At an Amazon conference Tuesday, Downey announced the launch of an organization that would use robots and advanced technology to combat climate change. "Between robotics and technology, we could probably clean up the planet significantly, if not entirely, within a decade," he said. The group, called the Footprint Coalition, is set to start in April.  As the trade war between the United States and China escalates, Beijing may be preparing to play a new card: its control of rare earth minerals. Chinese state media this week issued a warning to the United States that it too has power over global supply chains. That coincided with a thinly veiled threat about rare earths, of which the country is a major exporter, from the government's top economic planning agency. Here's what you need to know about rare earths, and how they could play into the trade fight.
