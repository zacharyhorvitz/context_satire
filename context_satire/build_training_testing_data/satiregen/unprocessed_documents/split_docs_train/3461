 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders came face-to-face with Walmart's corporate leadership during the retail giant's annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday in Arkansas, where he introduced an employee proposal to put workers on the company's board and asked for a raise to its minimum wage. Speaking as a proxy for a Walmart employee, Sanders offered the resolution -- which would be defeated in an afternoon vote -- from the floor of a small, carpeted ballroom with Rachel Brand, a top company executive and former Justice Department official, presiding onstage. After giving the formal pitch, Sanders delivered a more cutting message to Walmart officials. "Despite the incredible wealth of its owner, Walmart pays many of its employees starvation wages, wages that are so low that many of these employees are forced to rely on government programs like food stamps, Medicaid and public housing in order to survive," Sanders said.  A shooting left one person dead and three others injured Friday evening in a Costco store in Southern California, police said. A man is in custody after firing inside the store, Lt. Jeff Edwards of the Corona police said. His name wasn't immediately released. The shooting stemmed from an argument inside the store, but the relationship among the victims and the alleged gunman is unclear, Edwards said. After retiring from basketball, Chang moved back to the United States, and then worked briefly in Southeast Asia for a US company. In 1995 he returned to Taiwan in order to set up a local subsidiary of Costco. His height and large build continued to serve him well in business. On one occasion, Chang was seated next to Chinatrust Commercial Bank executive Jeffrey Koo, Jr. (辜仲諒) on a flight.
