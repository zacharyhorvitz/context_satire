 The Los Angeles County District Attorney is forming a task force to evaluate sexual assault cases in Hollywood. "In response to the widespread allegations of sexual abuse in the entertainment industry, I have established a task force of specially trained deputy district attorneys who are ready to evaluate these cases if any are referred to my office for criminal prosecution," Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement. "I have assigned the group of veteran sex crimes prosecutors to work together to ensure a uniformed approach to the legal review and possible prosecution of any case that meets both the legal and factual standards for criminal prosecution." Lacey added that to date, her office has not received any cases from law enforcement for possible criminal filing. Hollywood is a neighborhood in the central region of Los Angeles, California, notable as the home of the U.S. film industry, including several of its historic studios. Its name has come to be a shorthand reference for the industry and the people associated with it. Hollywood was incorporated as a municipality in 1903. It was consolidated with the city of Los Angeles in 1910 and soon thereafter, a prominent film industry emerged, eventually becoming the most recognizable film industry in the world.  Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon compared the allegations of sexual misconduct with teens against Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore to the bombshell "Access Hollywood" tape that was released during the 2016 election, accusing The Washington Post of targeting both Moore and Donald Trump politically. "The Bezos Amazon Washington Post that dropped that dime on Donald Trump is the same Bezos Amazon Washington Post that dropped the dime this afternoon on Judge Roy Moore," Bannon said at a dinner of conservative activists in Manchester, New Hampshire, Thursday night. "Now is that a coincidence? That's what I mean when I say opposition party, right?"
