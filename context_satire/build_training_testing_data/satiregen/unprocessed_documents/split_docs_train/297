 Taylor Swift did something bad for the opening of the 2018 American Music Awards Tuesday night. The singer, who just wrapped the North American leg of her "Reputation" tour, kicked off the show with her single, "I Did Something Bad." Dressed in a sequined one-piece, Swift strutted the stage with her dancers to the delight of the audience. And, of course, there was a giant snake -- an emblem Swift has made her own after #TaylorSwiftIsASnake became a thing a few years ago as a diss against the singer.  Our live coverage of the American Music Awards has concluded for the night. Stick with CNN Entertainment for more. The American Music Awards paid tribute to Aretha Franklin, the late Queen of Soul, at the closing of their show on Tuesday night. The crowd were on their feet as Gladys Knight took the stage to kick things off with a rendition of "Amazing Grace."  In the Utah Senate debate Tuesday night, GOP candidate Mitt Romney called family separations at the border "a dark chapter in American history," and said that "this is inexcusable, and can't go on." "This was a heartbreak," Romney said at the debate, in response to a question about immigrant family separation. "This was a dark chapter in American history, to see children separated from their parents." "This is inexcusable, and can't go on," the Senate candidate said.
