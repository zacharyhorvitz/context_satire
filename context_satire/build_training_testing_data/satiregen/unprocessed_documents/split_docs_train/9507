The Kansas Insurance Commissioner (KIC), in full the Kansas State Insurance Commissioner, has the primary responsibility to the people whose personal lives are protected by insurance in the state of Kansas. It is an elected position and is currently held by Republican Vicki Schmidt. Transfers to Hill Street in Season 7. An able patrol officer, but Tina also works undercover from time to time, which is how she first comes into contact with J.D. (who is unaware that she is also a police officer). Russo gets into some trouble for sleeping with a criminal whom she is investigating, rather than merely "seducing" him at length. The title comes from Judge Wachtel's wig as he wears a wire to help the DA's office convict a group of Mafia-connected loan sharks. The Hill Street precinct is also targeting them (with Belker, Renko, and Hill undercover), as is the State Liquor Authority, leading to considerable confusion and a SLA bust that nearly collapses the entire operation. Garibaldi does some unofficial investigation to avoid being sued after he crashed without insurance - Washington assists him, successfully. Marcus Peabody, a former gang member, is accused of corruption and embarrasses his new employer, Mayor Cleveland, who fires him.
