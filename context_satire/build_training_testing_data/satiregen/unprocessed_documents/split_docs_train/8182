The recording of Bridge over Troubled Water was difficult and Simon and Garfunkel's relationship had deteriorated. "At that point, I just wanted out," Simon later said. Garfunkel hoped for a two-year break and did not intend to pursue a film career; likewise, Simon did not intend to begin a solo career. At the urging of Simon's wife, Peggy Harper, he called Davis to confirm the duo's breakup. Eno was finally not credited as producer but as provider of "sonic landscape". Simon expressed gratitude with the album â€“ "Working with Brian Eno opens the door to a world of sonic possibilities; plus he's just a great guy to hang with in the studio, or for that matter in life. I had a really good time." As he commented years later, after the disappointing commercial performance of Hearts and Bones, Simon felt he had lost his inspiration to a point of no return, and that his commercial fortunes were unlikely to change. While driving his car in late 1984 in this state of frustration, Simon listened to a cassette of the Boyoyo Boys' instrumental Gumboots: Accordion Jive Volume II which had been lent to him by Heidi Berg, a singer-songwriter he was working with at the time. Lorne Michaels had introduced Simon to Berg when Berg was working as the bandleader for Michael's The New Show. Interested by the unusual sound, he wrote lyrics to the number, which he sang over a re-recording of the song.
