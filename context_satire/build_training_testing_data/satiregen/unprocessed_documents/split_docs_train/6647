In September 1945, Melberg presented the first version of his hypothesis on the origin of the Scandinavian nations to the Norwegian Science Academy in Oslo. It was met with silence. A year later, it was presented to the Danish Science Academy in Copenhagen, where it provoked animated discussion. Due to misunderstandings and the need for background information that became apparent during these discussions, Melberg decided to present his work with all the information required to evaluate the hypothesis. Melberg was raised by working musicians and following her appearance right out of high school at the International Pop Underground Convention in Olympia, Washington in 1991, she had almost instant success with the all-female Tiger Trap. The short-lived band garnered a cult following in indie-pop circles. Following the dissolution of the Softies, she gave birth to a son and lived with her husband and family near Vancouver, Canada. She returned to the pop world with her second solo album, Cast Away the Clouds. This is regarded as one of the more plot-driven novels in the series, with more emphasis on the story. Erika wants to write a 'great book' so Patrik goes on paternity leave to look after the baby whilst this occurs, then unexplained things start to happen: an elderly neighbour is found dead â€“ not just that, but he has been dead for some time. What's more, this man knew Erika's late mother. Erika consults a local World War II historian, however, shortly after her visit, he is brutally murdered and it becomes clear that the past is still very much a part of some people's lives.
