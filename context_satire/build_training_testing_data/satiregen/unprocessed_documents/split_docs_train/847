Ayers was seen as playing an influential role in advising Trump to name two Georgians—Sonny Perdue and Congressman Tom Price—to the Cabinet. "Georgia walks away with two of the most consequential Cabinet secretaries who happen to be the two most qualified for the job," said Ayers. "It's a testament to the president's extraordinary decision making and his appreciation to Georgia."  Employees from two Department of Agriculture research agencies stood and turned their backs to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue at an all-hands meeting Thursday to silently protest a decision to relocate the agencies halfway across the country. Perdue announced earlier Thursday morning that the Economic Research Service, which provides research and statistical analysis for lawmakers, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which allocates federal research funding, will be relocated to Kansas City from Washington, DC, the final announcement in a process that began last year. The department says the move will save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, but many employees view the change as politically driven and a way to disrupt climate research and other work with which their bosses disagree. Both agencies recently voted overwhelmingly to unionize to push back against the move. While studying as an undergraduate, Ayers joined the College Republicans, becoming president of the school's chapter. During this time, he met Sonny Perdue, who at the time was planning to run for Governor. Ayers joined Perdue's campaign as a teenage body man for the Republican state senator, taking time off from Kennesaw State University. He initially went to school with the goal of becoming a banker, but his role with Perdue – part assistant, part adviser, part protégé – convinced him to launch a career in politics.
