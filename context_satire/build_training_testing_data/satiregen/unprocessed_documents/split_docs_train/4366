To replace Gibbs, Oklahoma looked towards the seasoned Howard Schnellenberger, then 61Â years old. Schnellenberger had a well-established reputation for turning teams around. He had built Miami from an also-ran to a national champion in 1983, and turned around a once-moribund Louisville program. In the end, he was almost too sure of himself. Suddenly, in 1988, it all came crashing down for Switzer. His team was placed on probation by the NCAA for violating several rules. In a six-month time frame, there was a shooting and a rape in the athletic dorm on Oklahoma's campus. Switzer's house was robbed with the help of one of his athletes, and an athlete was caught attempting to sell drugs to an undercover agent. After the 1964 season, Chuck Fairbanks, an assistant coach at Houston, was offered a job at Tennessee. He wanted to accept, but it was the middle of the summer and unusually late for a coaching move, so he decided to stay loyal to Houston and remained there. After the next season, he was offered a position as an assistant on Mackenzie's staff at Oklahoma, a position he felt was a better job than the Tennessee position. Immediately after the 1965 season, Fairbanks was offered a job at Missouri with the promise that he would be the head coach within four years.
