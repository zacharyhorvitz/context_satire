A tablet at the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris, dating to 50 CE, was sent from Nazareth to Paris in 1878. It contains an inscription known as the "Ordinance of Caesar" that outlines the penalty of death for those who violate tombs or graves. However, it is suspected that this inscription came to Nazareth from somewhere else (possibly Sepphoris). Bagatti writes: "we are not certain that it was found in Nazareth, even though it came from Nazareth to Paris. One source of confusion was in record keeping was that the South side was essentially closed in 2014 due to an avalanche disrupting the Khumbu Icefall. So most of the summiters summited from the North side, except for a small group that flew a helicopter over the Khumbu Icefall, even though it was not open. This is why in 2016 Adrian Ballinger said on Instagram "9 Sherpa using supplemental oxygen became the first to summit on the South Side of Everest in the past 3 years" in 2016. The full Nepal route to the summit was not open in 2014 or in 2015, but there was a group that summited from the south side in 2014 as part of a Chinese team that used a helicopter to reach that area. In 1263, Baybars, the Mamluk Sultan, destroyed the Christian buildings in Nazareth and declared the site off-limits to Latin clergy, as part of his bid to drive out the remaining Crusaders from Palestine. While Arab Christian families continued to live in Nazareth, its status was reduced to that of a poor village. Pilgrims who visited the site in 1294 reported only a small church protecting the grotto. In the 14th century, Franciscan monks were permitted to return and live within the ruins of the basilica.
