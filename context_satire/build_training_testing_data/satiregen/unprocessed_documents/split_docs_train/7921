 One month after the FDA asked it to remove an opioid from the market, pharmaceutical maker Endo has announced it will pull the drug. The company said in a statement posted on its website it still believes in the efficacy and safety of Opana ER, or oxymorphone hydrochloride. The FDA said the request was the first time it had asked that an opioid pain medication be pulled because of "the public health consequences of abuse." Opana ER is a powerful painkiller, about twice as powerful as OxyContin, another often abused opioid. Massachusetts v. Purdue is a lawsuit filed on August 14, 2018 suing the Stamford, Connecticut-based company Purdue Pharma LP, which created and manufactures OxyContin, "one of the most widely used and prescribed opioid drugs on the market", and Purdue's owners, the Sacklers accusing them of "widespread fraud and deception in the marketing of opioids, and contributing to the opioid crisis, the nationwide epidemic that has killed thousands." Purdue denied the allegations. In 1996, Purdue Pharma "began a massive marketing campaign", based on a "unique claim" for OxyContin, with FDA permission, that, "as a long-acting opioid, it might be less likely to cause abuse and addiction than shorter-acting painkillers like Percocet." By 1998, Purdue's audiotapes, brochures, videotapes, literature and its website "Partners Against Pain", "claimed that the risk of addiction from OxyContin was extremely small."
