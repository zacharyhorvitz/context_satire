The Subway $5 footlong promotion is a promotion by the fast food restaurant chain Subway, which was launched in the United States in 2008 by offering footlong (30Â cm) submarine sandwiches for $5, equivalent to $5.94 in 2019. Coinciding with the Great Recession, the promotion was very successful for the chain, spurring competitors to make similar moves to cut prices to attract customers. The promotion also helped start an ongoing trend of round price points on consumer goods. In 2017, the chain closed more than 800 of its U.S. locations. In April 2018, the chain announced it would close about 500 more that year. According Abha Bhattarai of The Washington Post, this is a result of three consecutive years of falling profits, and foot traffic in Subway stores reduced by 25 percent since 2012. Franchisees also complained that the company's deep promotions further ate away at profits.
