 From the beginning, everyone underestimated Donald Trump. He pulled off a stunning victory after the most unprecedented of presidential campaigns. Trump channeled the fury of average Americans against Washington. He tapped into their anxiety about the present and the fear of the future. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman testified in person before the U.S. House of Representatives. In his testimony, Vindman said he had made a report to an intelligence official about what he heard during Trump's call with the Ukrainian President and felt what the President mentioned during the phone conversation was "improper". Testifying alongside Vindman was Vice President Mike Pence's chief European security adviser Jennifer Williams. Williams testified that when Zelensky was elected, Pence initially agreed to attend the inauguration if his schedule permitted, but that plan was cancelled when on May 13, Williams was informed that President Trump had decided Pence would not represent the U.S. at the inauguration in Ukraine after all.  Donald Trump's daughter-in-law Lara on Tuesday assured CNN's Erin Burnett she and Melania Trump had both voted for Trump when they cast their ballots in New York City earlier in the day. The remark came after Burnett played videotape that appeared to show Lara Trump's husband, Eric, peeking at her ballot, and tape that appeared to show Donald Trump inspecting the ballot of Melania. Those videos rocketed around social media earlier in the day. "I haven't even seen either of those," said Trump laughing.
