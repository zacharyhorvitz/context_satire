Work for Fortune began on September 2, 2011, with Kevin McCall revealing that he had been collaborating "heavily" with Brown for an upcoming album. Later that month, producer David Banner explained that the idea of the album was to create material that reflects earlier R&B efforts by Brown and others in a more club-oriented style. Banner also revealed details of a song that he and Brown recorded for Fortune, saying: "When I tell you, you know how they don't play that much R&B in the club no more? ... Brad Wete of Billboard praised the album's sound, but he was dissatisfied towards its lyrical content, saying "Admittedly, a rich 26-year-old bachelorâ€™s life is full of romps with women and wild nights. Fame, access, and talent bring those with ease. This seems to be an art imitating life thing. But if and when Brown ascends to the next level, it likely will be because he starts talking about the morning after. In addition to recording, it was revealed later that month that Brown was in the studio working on the album with Asher Roth, Nas, Wiz Khalifa, will.i.am, and Kid Sister. On January 20, 2012, Brown announced that Nas will appear as a guest vocalist on the album. In an interview with MTV News, producer Harvey Mason, Jr., half of production duo the Underdogs, who co-wrote and co-produced "Turn Up the Music", spoke more about the album, saying "The Fortune record is F.A.M.E to the next level. Similar material, but he's really being innovative with some of the music that you haven't heard before, taking pieces of other genres and integrating them into pop and R&B, which I think is really cool.
