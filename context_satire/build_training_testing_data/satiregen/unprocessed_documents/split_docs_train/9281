 President Donald Trump met with the publisher of the New York Times A.G. Sulzberger earlier this month. But the two seem to have different recollections of the July 20th meeting at the White House. Trump first revealed the meeting took place in a tweet on Sunday morning from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. "Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with A.G. Sulzberger, Publisher of the New York Times," Trump wrote. After winning the election, Trump told journalist Lesley Stahl he intentionally demeaned and discredited the media "so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you". Into his presidency, Trump has described negative media coverage as "fake news". Trump has privately and publicly mused about taking away critical reporters' White House press credentials. His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.  The ultra-competitive White House press corps is displaying something rare and refreshing: Solidarity. Journalists reacted with dismay when the Trump administration barred CNN's Kaitlan Collins from attending a presidential event in the Rose Garden. Two White House officials, Bill Shine and Sarah Sanders, told Collins that she asked "inappropriate" questions during Trump's meeting with European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. So the ban was retaliatory in nature.
