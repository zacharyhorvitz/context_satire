In "Weight Loss", Andy continually pesters Angela with ideas for their wedding. Most of his proposals are outlandish and expensive, and Angela continues to treat him and his ideas with contempt. She pages Dwight, and they meet in the Dunder Mifflin warehouse to have sex. This seems to be a habit, but later in the episode Andy tells Angela he doesn't care where they marry so long as they're together. In "The Convention", she secretly follows Dwight to the office supply convention in Philadelphia under the name "Jane Doe" and gets a room which Jim accidentally enters, though it does not appear he saw that it was her (exclaiming "Dwight got a hooker!"). Angela would seem to call Dwight "D" outside the office, as she (mistakenly) does when Jim enters Dwight's hotel room. She also persuades Dwight to supplant Michael as Regional Manager (Ã  la Lady Macbeth), but it does not succeed. She has a good first impression of Andy Bernard when he shows up on his first day with a cat screensaver. In "Viewing Party", she and Dwight agree to have sex during the night as part of their contract. However, Pam and Jim prevent him from going to Angela due to the fact that their baby seems to be attracted to Dwight, so she's left waiting in the back seat of her car, visibly topless when Pam comes out to see her.
