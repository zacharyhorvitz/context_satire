 There have now been nearly 9,000 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) across seven affected countries. At least 4,400 people have died so far in this, the worst outbreak of EVD since it emerged in 1976. The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning that weekly cases could reach 10,000 by the start of December -- it is clear that the peak of this epidemic hasn't yet been reached. Understandably, countries around the world -- particularly those affected (Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States of America) -- have been examining their defenses against importing cases. In 2018, the Nebraska Medicine network had 809 licensed beds. In 2018, Elkhorn Health Center, as well as a new building for Fontenelle Health Center, opened. Nebraska Medicine moved its Clarkson Family Medicine Clinic to a larger building in downtown Omaha, also performing the first bloodless stem cell transplant in the state. By 2019, some Nebraska Medicine hospital rooms featured virtual reality headsets to teach patients about procedures. In January 2017, Nebraska Medicine announced that it would open Chalco Health Center in Chalco, as a primary care clinic and its fourth immediate care location, at which point it had around 40 clinic locations. That May, Nebraska Medicine opened the Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, a partly public partnership with various state and county investors. In September 2017, Nebraska Medicine closed its burn unit due to reduced patient volume. Opened in 1995, the unit had treated 100 burn patients annually.
