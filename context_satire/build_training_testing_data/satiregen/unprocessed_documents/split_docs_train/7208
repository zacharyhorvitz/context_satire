 President Donald Trump on Friday reiterated his support for tighter abortion restrictions, pledging at the annual March for Life rally in Washington that "unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House." Trump, making history as the first President to attend the event since it began nearly a half-century ago, looked to strengthen his ties to a key coalition of his political base, which he'll need as he seeks reelection this year. He used his remarks to not only express support for the movement but to paint those supportive of looser abortion laws as radicals, often employing language that mischaracterized the views of most Democrats. "Together we are the voice for the voiceless.  President Donald Trump will attend Friday's March for Life, an annual anti-abortion event in Washington, he announced on Twitter. "See you on Friday...Big Crowd!" Trump tweeted Wednesday, sharing a video from last year's march. Trump will be the first president to attend the march, according to Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life.  After months of wrangling, the Senate's impeachment trial, at last, began this week. But that doesn't mean the wrangling is over. The Democrats acting as the House's impeachment managers have spent the week arguing why President Donald Trump should be impeached, and have sought to aim their message at convincing four Republicans to vote with them for witnesses in the trial. Republicans, meanwhile, say the Democrats aren't doing anything new.
