 Nearly half a million Americans chose plans on HealthCare.gov during the first week of open enrollment for 2015, a sign the federal health care site has improved since its rocky rollout last year. The Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that more than a million Americans submitted applications for coverage in the first week of open enrollment for 2015. From Nov. 15-21, 462,000 Americans chose plans on HealthCare.gov, with a little under half, or about 220,000, of those being new purchasers. Those figures only include numbers from the 37 states that offer coverage through the federal site, rather than state-based exchanges That's a marked improvement from the 2014 open enrollment period, when 27,000 people signed up for coverage on HealthCare.gov during the entire first month.

Yet a new report shows that patient safety efforts at U.S. hospitals seem to be paying off.
