 Apple on Wednesday announced the latest version of the iPhone. The iPhone 5 looks similar to previous models but has a larger screen and is lighter and thinner than the iPhone 4S. The company says the larger screen will make it easier to check and send e-mails and to view Web pages with the phone in your hand. The phone also comes with a new, faster processor called the Apple A6, which  connects to mobile carriers with a 4G LTE connection, making for speedier Internet browsing.  Apple on Wednesday unveiled a thinner, taller, faster iPhone 5 at a highly anticipated event in San Francisco. The device, which is 18% thinner and 20% lighter than the iPhone 4S, is the thinnest smartphone in the world, according to Apple. With a four-inch screen, the iPhone 5 allows for five rows of apps -- one more than previous versions of the device, which sported a 3.5-inch screen. Apple said the iPhone 5's processor speed is twice as fast as the previous version, an advance made possible by the company's new "A6" chip.  The iPhone 5 hasn't even hit stores yet and it's already blowing the doors off the competition. Apple pre-sold 2 million iPhone 5s in one day, setting a new smartphone record. It goes on sale officially on Friday morning. Industry analysts widely expect the iPhone 5 to be the bestselling mobile device of all time.
