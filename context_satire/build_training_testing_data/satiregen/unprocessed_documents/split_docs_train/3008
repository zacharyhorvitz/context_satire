Dan Newman, spokesman for the Angelides campaign, said that the results prove "that the governor's office was directly 100 percent responsible for making the tapes public...and then called in taxpayer funded law enforcement in a crude attempt to cover up his error." In the summer of his third year, Maxwell spent some time at the Suffolk home of the Rev C.B. Tayler, the uncle of a classmate, G.W.H. Tayler. The love of God shown by the family impressed Maxwell, particularly after he was nursed back from ill health by the minister and his wife. He said the CHP report spells out the need for inquiries to determine if the governor's office "exerted pressure on the (Highway Patrol)" to delay the results of the inquiry until after the election. "They took five months to determine something they knew in five minutes," said Newman, who added that questions still remain about whether the governor's office used the law enforcement agency during the gubernatorial election "for purely political purposes."
