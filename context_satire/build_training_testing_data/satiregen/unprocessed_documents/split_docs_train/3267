James Durbin (born January 6, 1989) is from Santa Cruz, California, and 22 years old at the time of the show. He originally auditioned in the eighth season and was not selected.

Scotty McCreery (born October 9, 1993) is from Garner, North Carolina, and was 17 years old at the time of the show. He auditioned in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with Josh Turner's "Your Man" and Travis Tritt's "Put Some Drive in Your Country". He reprised "Your Man" in the Hollywood rounds but forgot the words to Lee Ann Womack's "I Hope You Dance". He also performed "Get Ready" with the group "The Guaps" and became involved in the drama when Clint Jun Gamboa ousted young Jacee Badeaux from their group. Many fans of the ninth season winner, Lee DeWyze, were upset that he did not take part in the season ten finale like he was rumored to. Executive producer Nigel Lythgoe responded on his Twitter that he asked DeWyze to take part in the finale, but he declined, "I was so upset Lee DeWyze wouldn't present the winners trophy to Scotty," he wrote. "Especially as he'd been on the show this Season. I guess he was shy."
