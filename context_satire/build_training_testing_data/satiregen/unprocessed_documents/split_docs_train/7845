 The brutality of Syria's civil war is staggering: More than 300,000 people killed, and millions either internally displaced or have fled the country altogether. But one American says he wouldn't want to live anywhere else. Thomas Webber, 71, has called the capital city of Damascus home for more than 40 years. "I had a pretty bad landing when I flew into Damascus in 1975 so I didn't fall in love with the place on the first day," he says with a smile. The meaning of the word American in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. American is derived from America, a term originally denoting all of the New World (also called the Americas). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the United States of America. In modern English, American generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification.

Hall says, wherever Americah Pharoah was, the thoroughbred "stood out" and was very much an "alpha" individual.
