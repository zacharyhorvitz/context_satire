Housed in the Albright Hall and Yearsley Hall, Sanford’s lower school consists of students from PreK–grade 4. It is here that the values of trust, respect, honesty and cooperation are first incorporated in the classroom. This is embodied in the lower school rule: “Respect people and property”. Sanford's lower school ethos provides a framework for children to grow into supportive and successful members of the school community. Sanford's high school aims to strike an artful balance between focused, intensive, high-school academics and a community spirit that aims to foster joy and satisfaction in students’ accomplishments, both in and out of the classroom. After the war, in 1868, Brown turned his attention to the newly accessible Japan, at first by interacting with the students that Japan was sending to the Bridgeport Academy and Princeton University for education in Western world culture and technology. This cultural exchange was a two way process. Rev. Brown published another satire showing America as seen through the eyes of one of these Japanese students, which was sharply critical of New England's materialism, in place of spirituality.
