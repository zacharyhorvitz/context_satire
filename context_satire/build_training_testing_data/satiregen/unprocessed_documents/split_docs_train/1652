 Once again, Elon Musk is in the middle of a controversy of his own making. And he may be testing investors' patience. Over the weekend, the tech entrepreneur caught flak for tweeting an unfounded accusation that one of the cavers who helped rescue 12 boys from a Thai cave is a pedophile. He has since deleted the tweet.  British rescuer Vern Unsworth says he is considering legal action against US billionaire Elon Musk after he made an unfounded and disparaging claim he was  a "pedo", or pedophile, in a now-deleted tweet. Unsworth, a caver based in Thailand, provided knowledge of the Tham Luang cave system, which helped with the rescue of 12 school boys and their soccer coach in a flooded Thai cave last week. Musk, the CEO of several high-profile American tech companies, broadcast the claim to his 22 million social media followers on Sunday after Unsworth criticized a miniature submarine he made. Asked by a Nine Network reporter if he was going to take legal action again Musk, Unsworth replied: "Yes, yes, it's not finished."
