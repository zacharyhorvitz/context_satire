Eight years of magic, love and laughter with the Huxtable family come to an end. Cliff's invitation list for Theo's graduation from NYU continues to grow as he invites a host of relatives and friends to celebrate and, despite a scarcity of tickets, he just keeps on inviting people. Theo's protests fall on deaf ears: "If they ask me, they're coming," declares the proud father. Denise calls from Singapore to tell the family that she and Martin are expecting. The English bands Shriekback, founded by Dave Allen from the Gang of Four and Barry Andrews of XTC, asked Julian on two tours of the North America and Europe. Julian's thoughts on being compared to Hendrix? "I never wanted to emulate him because he is someone that can't be touched, but I am honoured that people would say that about me." With his influences being such notable figures as Charlie Parker, Albert Ayler and Charlie Christian it is no wonder that he has developed a distinct style all his own. Cliff and Clair take a well-earned break from kids and chores, depositing Rudy at Grandma's, dropping Vanessa at a friend's house and heading for the Poconos. That leaves Theo alone in the house for the weekend. When his friends hear about it, they organized a party. But, somehow, the "intimate gathering" of close friends turns into an open house for hundreds, most of them strangers.
