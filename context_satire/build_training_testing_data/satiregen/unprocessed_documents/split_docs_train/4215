Jane Stanford's actions were sometimes eccentric. In 1897, she directed the board of trustees "that the students be taught that everyone born on earth has a soul germ, and that on its development depends much in life here and everything in Life Eternal". She forbade students from sketching nude models in life-drawing class, banned automobiles from campus, and did not allow a hospital to be constructed so that people would not form an impression that Stanford was unhealthy. Between 1899 and 1905, she spent $3 million on a grand construction scheme building lavish memorials to the Stanford family, while university faculty and self-supporting students were living in poverty.  The mother of a Chinese student who was admitted to Stanford University said the family gave $6.5 million to the man at the center of a massive college admissions scandal as a donation for scholarships and funding. Fifty people have been charged in the largest college admissions scam prosecuted in the United States. The scandal has ensnared celebrities such as Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, none of whom allegedly spent as much as the Chinese woman. In a statement through her attorney, the woman identified as Mrs. Zhao admits giving $6.5 million to the foundation of William "Rick" Singer, the ring leader of the scam.  The family of a Chinese student who was admitted to Stanford University paid $6.5 million to the central figure in the US college admissions scandal, a source with knowledge of the investigation says. It has not been determined whether the student's parents were seeking an advantage to get their daughter into Stanford with the payment to Rick Singer, the source said. There's still the possibility they may have done nothing wrong but that will be determined by investigators, the source added. Morgan Stanley adviser Michael Wu referred the parents to Singer, the source said.
