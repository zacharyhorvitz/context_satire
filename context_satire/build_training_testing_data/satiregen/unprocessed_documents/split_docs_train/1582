 For many Americans, my daughter, Brittany Maynard, was the face of the right-to-die movement. Diagnosed in early 2014 with terminal brain cancer, she chose to move from California to Oregon to take advantage of that state's Death with Dignity Law. It was there that she ended her life two years ago this November. The process of moving to Oregon, which required numerous trips in and out of the state, was not easy for Britt, but in some respects she was fortunate.  A new poll offering a deep dive into the political views of the youngest American voters finds them favoring Hillary Clinton and no less likely to vote than they were in 2012, but younger Americans' outlook on the country's future centers far more on fear than hope. A majority of Americans under age 30, 51%, say they feel fearful about America's future, and only 41% say they expect to be better off than their parents are today, according to the survey released Wednesday by the Harvard Institute of Politics. The poll suggests no drop-off in interest in politics among young Americans compared with 2012. The share saying they plan to vote is on par with this stage in the 2012 election, and just about the same share consider themselves politically engaged now as did four years ago.  The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus accused Republicans Wednesday of wanting to intimidate African-American voters in North Carolina in order to "nullify their votes." "The Republicans are saying that they're going to intimidate African-Americans on Election Day to try to nullify their votes. We're playing offense and defense," North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Butterfield made the accusation as part of a discussion about African-American turnout in North Carolina, though he did not point to any particular incident.
