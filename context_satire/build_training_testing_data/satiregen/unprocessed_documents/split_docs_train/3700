 President Barack Obama was spotted bidding farewell to members of his White House staff Thursday as his administration winds down. Obama spoke to about 100 staffers gathered on the steps of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building inside the White House complex. Cameras couldn't pick up his comments, but his team laughed and cheered as he addressed them. After he finished, Obama posed for a photo and stood to shake each of his staff members' hands.  President Barack Obama momentarily batted back tears as he thanked his wife, Michelle, during the emotional tail-end of his farewell address in Chicago Tuesday. "Michelle Lavaughn Robinson, girl of the South Side -- for the past 25 years, you have not only been my wife, the mother of my children, you have been my best friend," Obama said. "You took on a job you didn't ask for, and you made it your own with grace and with grit and with style and good humor." Obama at one point took out a white handkerchief to wipe his eyes.  President Barack Obama plans to travel to Palm Springs after the inauguration Friday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday. "The first family is looking forward to flying to Palm Springs, California, on Friday," Earnest said, noting the desert city fits the bill of a warm destination, which Obama has long promised. "He and his family have enjoyed the time they spent there in the past, and they're looking forward to traveling there on Friday," Earnest added. Obama will fly aboard the presidential aircraft to the Coachella Valley oasis, where he's taken frequent golf trips as president, two sources familiar with his plans told CNN earlier Tuesday.
