A term of Congress is divided into two "sessions", one for each year; Congress has occasionally been called into an extra or special session. A new session commences on January 3 each year, unless Congress decides differently. The Constitution requires Congress meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the Capitol without the consent of the other house. From 1972 to 1976, Dudley served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. She was believed to be the first Democratic legislator from Durham in nearly fifty years. About halfway through her first term, an unexpected and environmentally impactful change was proposed that would have altered Dudley's hometown and the entire seacoast of New Hampshire: the construction of one of the world's largest oil refinery. After passage by both houses, a bill is enrolled and sent to the president for approval. The president may sign it making it law or veto it, perhaps returning it to Congress with the president's objections. A vetoed bill can still become law if each house of Congress votes to override the veto with a two-thirds majority. Finally, the president may do nothing—neither signing nor vetoing the bill—and then the bill becomes law automatically after ten days (not counting Sundays) according to the Constitution.
