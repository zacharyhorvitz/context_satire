Bethesda is a township in Saint Paul Parish on the island of Antigua, in Antigua and Barbuda. It is located in the southeastern area of the island, to the northeast of English Harbour, at the head of Willoughby Bay. Bethesda is a town and community on the River Ogwen and the A5 road on the edge of Snowdonia, in Gwynedd, north-west Wales. It is the 5th largest Community in Gwynedd. Bethesda is located in Ellicott City, Maryland within Howard County, Maryland, United States. The home is sometimes mistakenly referred to as "Dower House" because a small dower house exists on the property. A "dower" is a widow's share for life of her husband's estate, so a dower house is where a widowed mother would live when her son and his family inherited and moved into the main house. The foundation of the original house was found using ground penetrating radar to the west of the existing structure.
