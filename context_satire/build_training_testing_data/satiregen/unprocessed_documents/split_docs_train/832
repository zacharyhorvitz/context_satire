The Barack Obama Facebook (@barackobama) is currently the official Facebook for the former president and was his Facebook during the campaign trail. Looking back onto the election, Obama was able to mobilize the public through social media, especially Facebook. In fact, by the peak of the Obama campaign, his Facebook has around 3 million friends. Marc Anderson, board member of Facebook and founder of Netscape, said â€œOther politicians I have met with are always impressed by the Web and surprised by what it could do, but their interest sort of ended in how much money you could raise. After winning the election, Trump said in a Nov. 12, 2016 television interview that, as president, his use of social media would be "very restrained, if I use it at all." He did reduce his number of tweets during his early time in office. Since then, however, he has increased his use of Twitter. For example, he tweeted over 1,000 times during the month of October 2019 while the impeachment inquiry was underway. Donald Trump's use of social media has attracted worldwide attention. He frequently uses Twitter and other social media platforms to make comments about other politicians, celebrities and daily news. From his official declaration of candidacy in June 2015 through the first two-and-a-half years of his presidency, he tweeted over 17,000 times. Since early in his presidency, his tweets have been considered official statements by the president of the United States.
