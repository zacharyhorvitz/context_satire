 President Donald Trump warned Iran of "severe consequences" if it restarted its nuclear program, one day after he announced the US would withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, which has kept Tehran from developing its atomic program. Asked what he would do if Iran restarted its program, Trump said: "I would advise Iran not to start their nuclear program." "If they do, there will be very severe consequences," the President said Wednesday during a Cabinet meeting. Trump announced Tuesday he is quitting the Iran nuclear deal, pitting him against the United States' closest allies and leaving the future of Tehran's nuclear ambitions in question.  French President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed Europe's commitment to the Iran nuclear deal Wednesday while urging Tehran to take part in future discussions over its ballistic missile program. A day after US President Donald Trump announced he was quitting the pact, putting him on a collision course with some of the US' closest allies, Macron spoke with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani by telephone as attempts to salvage the deal began in earnest. According to an Élysée Palace readout of the call, Macron urged Iran to "engage in a wide discussion with all parties involved" on topics including the country's nuclear program after 2025, its ballistic missiles and its actions across the Middle East. Macron confirmed that the French and Iranian foreign ministers would meet soon to ensure progress.  President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that the US is withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, arguing that remaining in the current agreement would lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. "It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement," Trump said from the White House Diplomatic Room. "The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing we know exactly what will happen."
