 Myanmar has to "achieve peace," the country's figurehead Aung San Suu Kyi said Wednesday, amid accusations that her government is leading a brutal crackdown against the Rohingya Muslim minority. As former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan flew to volatile northern Rakhine state, where most of Myanmar's Rohingyas live, Suu Kyi called for "national reconciliation". Annan's trip comes less than a day after the UN's Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, expressed alarm at reports of a crackdown against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority. "These allegations must be verified as a matter of urgency," Dieng said in a statement on Tuesday. In 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma, at first to tend for her ailing mother but later to lead the pro-democracy movement. Aris' visit in Christmas 1995 turned out to be the last time that he and Aung San Suu Kyi met, as Aung San Suu Kyi remained in Burma and the Burmese dictatorship denied him any further entry visas. Aris was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 which was later found to be terminal. Despite appeals from prominent figures and organizations, including the United States, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and Pope John Paul II, the Burmese government would not grant Aris a visa, saying that they did not have the facilities to care for him, and instead urged Aung San Suu Kyi to leave the country to visit him. In November 2007, it was reported that Aung San Suu Kyi would meet her political allies National League for Democracy along with a government minister. The ruling junta made the official announcement on state TV and radio just hours after UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari ended his second visit to Burma. The NLD confirmed that it had received the invitation to hold talks with Suu Kyi. However, the process delivered few concrete results.
