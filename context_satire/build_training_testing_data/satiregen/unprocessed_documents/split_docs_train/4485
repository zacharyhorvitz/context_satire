Mueller has cited his teammate David Spencer Hackett's death in the Vietnam War as an influence on his decision to pursue military service. Of his classmate, Mueller has said, "One of the reasons I went into the Marine Corps was because we lost a very good friend, a Marine in Vietnam, who was a year ahead of me at Princeton. There were a number of us who felt we should follow his example and at least go into the service. And it flows from there." After a call from Michael and Chloe's father Gary (Muse Watson), the trio arrive to the family estate to meet him and learn that he has dementia and is losing his mind. Gary's new wife Annabelle (Leslie Easterbrook) takes care of him, but has decided to leave him because he was abusive and beat her. In 1931, when Ziglar was five years old, his father took a management position at a Mississippi farm, and his family moved to Yazoo City, Mississippi, where he spent most of his early childhood. The next year, his father died of a stroke, and his younger sister died two days later.
