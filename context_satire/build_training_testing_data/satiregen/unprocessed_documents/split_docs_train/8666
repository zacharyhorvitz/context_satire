A media report on June 20, 2013 revealed that Zuckerberg actively engaged with Facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a FWD.us video. In response to a claim that the FWD.us organization is "just about tech wanting to hire more people", the Internet entrepreneur replied: "The bigger problem we're trying to address is ensuring the 11 million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly." The Barack Obama Facebook (@barackobama) is currently the official Facebook for the former president and was his Facebook during the campaign trail. Looking back onto the election, Obama was able to mobilize the public through social media, especially Facebook. In fact, by the peak of the Obama campaign, his Facebook has around 3 million friends. Marc Anderson, board member of Facebook and founder of Netscape, said â€œOther politicians I have met with are always impressed by the Web and surprised by what it could do, but their interest sort of ended in how much money you could raise.  Facebook refused to remove a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last month, but this week the company faces a new quandary: Will it remove a fake video of its own CEO, Mark Zuckerberg? The video, posted to Facebook-owned Instagram over the weekend, falsely portrays Zuckerberg as saying, "Imagine this for a second: One man, with total control of billions of people's stolen data, all their secrets, their lives, their futures." The video was made by taking 2017 footage of Zuckerberg and using artificial intelligence technology, known as deepfake technology, to manipulate Zuckerberg's face to make it appear he said something he didn't. Zuckerberg's voice is replaced by an actor's.
