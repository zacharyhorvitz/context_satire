Black Water was officially announced on January, 4th 2017 with Jean-Claude van Damme and Dolph Lundgren co-starring. Van Damme and Lundgren first collaborated on Universal Soldier in 1992. Since then, they've appeared in two sequels together (Universal Soldier: Regeneration and Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning), as well as The Expendables 2. According to screenwriter Chad Law, Black Water "came together" when producer Richard Switzer "called me up and said he wanted to do an action movie set on a submarine. Lionheart (also known as AWOL and Wrong Bet) is a 1990 action film directed by Sheldon Lettich, starring Jean-Claude van Damme and co-starring Brian Thompson, along with Harrison Page, Deborah Rennard, Lisa Pelikan, and Ashley Johnson. Van Damme plays a paratrooper legionnaire. When his brother is seriously injured, he returns to Los Angeles to enter the underground fighting circuit to raise money for his brother's family. On 21 October 2012, Van Damme was honored with a life-size statue of himself in his hometown of Brussels. He told reporters during the unveiling, "Belgium is paying me back something, but really it's to pay back to the dream. So when people come by here, it is not Jean-Claude van Damme but it's a guy from the street who believed in something. I want the statue to represent that".
