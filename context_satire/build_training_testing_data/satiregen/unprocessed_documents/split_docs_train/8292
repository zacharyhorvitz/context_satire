Lawrence Lessig has advocated electoral reform for many years, and conceived the idea of a crowdfunded Super PAC as a way to achieve such reform. Mayday PAC began in May 2014, but before officially launching the fund raising effort, Lessig led 200 people on a walk from Dixville Notch to Nashua in the New Hampshire, stopping at coffee shops and small events to talk with people about money in politics, to generate media attention; further walks are planned. He explained, "Yes, we want to spend big money to end the influence of big money... Ironic, I get it. In the United States, a political action committee (PAC) is a 527 organization that pools campaign contributions from members and donates those funds to campaigns for or against candidates, ballot initiatives, or legislation. The legal term PAC has been created in pursuit of campaign finance reform in the United States. This term is quite specific to all activities of campaign finance in the United States. Democracies of other countries use different terms for the units of campaign spending or spending on political competition (see political finance).
