After President Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice: "But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got."  The U.S. will do whatever it can to help Belgium bring to justice those responsible for Tuesday's terror attacks, President Barack Obama declared Tuesday. Obama urged international unity in the fight against terror after the attacks left at least 34 people dead. "We will do whatever is necessary to support our friend and ally Belgium in bringing to justice those who are responsible," Obama said in brief remarks while in Cuba, where he was making an address to the Cuban people after his administration ended decades of estrangement between the two countries.

President Barack Obama aimed to capitalize on renewed goodwill in Latin America during a stop in Argentina on Wednesday for talks with a new leader more amenable to the United States. While not as historic as his visit to Cuba earlier in the week, Obama's stop in Argentina is seen by administration officials as symbolic of a thawing in the region prompted by opening ties to Havana. And the centrist government that recently took power, led by President Mauricio Macri, could be fertile ground for expanding U.S. ties. Obama sought to hasten those ties by announcing he would declassify documents about the U.S. role in Argentina's so-called Dirty War from the 1970s as a demonstration of openness.
