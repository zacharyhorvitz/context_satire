 House Republican leaders know that immediately after the Supreme Court rules on the health care law Thursday, they'll need to answer questions about what happens next on Capitol Hill -- and they're ready. At Wednesday's weekly meeting with rank-and-file members, House Speaker John Boehner announced that he and GOP Conference Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, have designated two top House Republicans to lead a rapid-response team, according to two GOP sources familiar with the discussion. Policy Committee Chairman Tom Price, R-Georgia, a physician, and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the top Republican woman in the House, will be the lead messengers, talking to television and radio outlets after news breaks on the ruling. McMorris Rodgers is also the chief liaison between GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign and House Republicans.  No matter how the Supreme Court rules on the challenge to the health care law, it will only be a matter of minutes after that ruling is announced before attention shifts back across the street to the Capitol and to what happens next there. Congressional press aides will be ready. Democrats and Republicans have spent months honing their messages. House GOP leaders have held "listening sessions" with rank-and-file members, going through various scenarios.  The battle royale for the hearts and minds of voters on President Barack Obama's signature health care reform law kicked into high gear mere moments after the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it had been upheld. Republicans instantly pounced on the ruling as proof that Obama is trying to raise taxes, while Democrats seemed eager to put the battle behind them and move on. Millions of dollars have been spent to shape public opinion on the law, and the campaigns and deep-pocketed donors to super PACs will spend millions more. But political experts say the cash poured into messaging may do little to sway voters, many of whom already hold deeply entrenched views on the law.
