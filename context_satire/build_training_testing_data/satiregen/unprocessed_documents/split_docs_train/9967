According to New York Post gossip columnist Michael Riedel, producer Jeffrey Seller wanted to take the show to Broadway before the end of the 2014-2015 season in order to capitalize on public interest in the show and win major awards at that years' Tonys; however, he was overruled by Miranda and Kail, as Miranda wanted more time to work on the show. Changes made between Off-Broadway and Broadway included the cutting of several numbers, a rewrite of Hamilton's final moments before his death, and a cutting-down of the song "One Last Ride" (now titled "One Last Time") to focus simply on Washington's decision not to run for a third term as President. The song "25 Years", one of Pantera's most personal songs" is about Phil Anselmo's father. Phil Anselmo said, "'25 Years' was written about my father," the singer begins. "And at the time  had a gigantic falling-out with him and I resented the fuck out of him and wrote a beautiful song about it." Anselmo continues, "It was a time capsule of how far he and I had not come, and I think a lot of fans could relate with the dysfunctional family vibe. The third release, on March 2, 2018, was "The Hamilton Polka" by "Weird Al" Yankovic, a polka medley of some of the songs from the musical. A fan of Yankovic since childhood, Miranda became friends with him after they tried to develop a musical together. About the origin of the song, Yankovic said, "Lin pitched it to me as a polka medley way more hesitantly than  should have. He was like, 'Would you want to do a polka medley?'
