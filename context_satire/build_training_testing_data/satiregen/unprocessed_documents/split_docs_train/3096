Knowing that Lalo was aware of Werner, Gus uses the opportunity to craft a cover story to present to Lalo, that Werner was working on a chilling system for the chicken farm, had stolen some of their drugs and ran away, and thus Mike had been forced to chase and kill him. Gus also has Mike arrange to send Werner's men home discretely and paid in full, and seal the partially-constructed lab, halting construction while Lalo is suspicious. Gus assures Mike that Werner's widow was compensated for his death, but Mike scorns at his lack of compassion for Werner, whom he considered a good friend, and refuses to accept any pay. Mike spends the next several weeks getting drunk, leading to an unwanted altercation with Kaylee, and Stacey tells him she feel it best he stay away from them for a while. The family lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant until their financial burdens necessitated a move to Brownsville when Tyson was 10 years old. Tyson's mother died six years later, leaving 16-year-old Tyson in the care of boxing manager and trainer Cus D'Amato, who would become his legal guardian. Tyson later said, "I never saw my mother happy with me and proud of me for doing something: she only knew me as being a wild kid running the streets, coming home with new clothes that she knew I didn't pay for. I never got a chance to talk to her or know about her. The DEA identifies Mike's connection to Gus, but he removes evidence from his home and hides getaway money in a "go bag" at the airport, so a police search of his home turns up nothing. The police identify the attorney Mike has been using to make the payments to Gus's former employees, then locate the money he has been saving for Stacey and Kaylee. Mike intends to flee and asks Saul to retrieve his go bag. Walt retrieves it instead and meets with Mike.
