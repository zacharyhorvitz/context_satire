Margarita Curtis, previously Dean of Studies at Phillips Andover, was the first woman to hold the position of Head of School at Deerfield Academy, retiring in 2019. Deerfield Academy was founded in 1797 when Massachusetts Governor Samuel Adams granted a charter to found a school in the town of Deerfield. It began to educate students in 1799. The school was prestigious, and graduates occupied many congressional and gubernatorial seats in New England. By the end of the 19th century, industrialization had economically hurt Deerfield, which was rural. In February 2013, ESA executive director Edward Shanahan told the Choate News that he and Hotchkiss head Malcolm McKenzie were among a group of American and Chinese educators working to establish an American-style prep school in Beijing, to be called the Keystone Academy. Shanahan said, "We have discussed this with the heads of the Eight Schools. Our hope is that  can be a resource for New England boarding schools." Shanahan will be Keystone's founding president and McKenzie its founding head of school.
