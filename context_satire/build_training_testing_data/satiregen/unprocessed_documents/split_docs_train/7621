Jacobson's most infamous news story occurred at WBBM-TV in February 1991, just two years before he switched to WFLD-TV. Wearing a fake beard, Jacobson dressed up as a homeless person and lived on the streets of Chicago for 48 hours, visiting Lower Wacker Drive, Clarendon Park, the corner of Halsted and Addison Streets, and the corner across the street from the Lincoln Park townhouse of his former anchor partner, Bill Kurtis. He had a hidden camera and recorded what he experienced in a series he dubbed "Mean Street Diary." Critics at the city's newspapers roundly mocked Jacobson for the stunt. After the 1911 season, Jacobson was signed by manager John McGraw of the New York Giants. In early April 1912, McGraw turned over Jacobson to the Mobile Sea Gulls of the Southern Association. On opening day of the 1912 season, the band began playing the popular song, "Oh, You Beautiful Doll", as Jacobson came to the plate. Jacobson recalled, "Well I led off with a home run on the first pitch and a lady sitting behind the plate jumped up and shouted, 'You must be that beautiful doll they were talking about.' Jacobson retired from farming in 1960 and died in Orion, Illinois, at the age of 86 and was buried at Dayton Corners Cemetery in Colona, Illinois. At the time of his death, The Sporting News wrote: "Although he never received more than a passing glance in the Hall of Fame voting, Jacobson's credentials are superior to many of the old-timers who have been enshrined."
