In 2012, poll analyst Mark Blumenthal criticized Gallup for a slight but routine under-weighting of black and Hispanic Americans that led to an approximately 2% shift of support away from Barack Obama. At the same time, Blumenthal commended Gallup for its "admirable commitment to transparency" and suggested that other polling firms disclose their raw data and methodologies. In contemporary politics, presidential job approval is highly partisan. Obama in his last year as sitting president achieved a job approval rating of 80 to 90 percent among Democrats and 15 to 20 percent among Republicans, while President Donald Trump in 2018 has a job approval of 75 to 90 among Republicans and 5 to 10 among Democrats. Gallup polling has found that, as of 2019, 47% of Americans are either "Democrats or Democratic leaners" while 42% are either "Republicans or Republican leaners". Gallup's most admired man and woman poll is an annual poll that Gallup has conducted at the end of most years since 1948. Americans are asked, without prompting, to say what man and woman "living today in any part of the world, do  admire most?" The result is published as a top ten list. Most years the most admired man is the sitting President of the United States and the most admired woman is or has been the First Lady of the United States.
