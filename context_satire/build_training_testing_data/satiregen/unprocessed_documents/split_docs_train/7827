Earth Crisis frontman Karl Buechner said that watching the video of "We Gotta Know" was "the spark that set off" his love for hardcore punk music and, during a 1996 interview, he would describe The Age of Quarrel as "still the greatest hardcore album of all time". Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed stated that the song "Life of My Own" inspired him to become a musician and named AOQ one of the most crucial albums in hardcore's history. In his first six screen appearances, Chewbacca was played by Peter Mayhew, who was chosen for his height of 7'3" (2.2 m). Five similar costumes were created for Mayhew: in the three original films and a holiday special, the suits were made of yak hair and mohair. In Revenge of the Sith, the suit was made of more comfortable materials, though Mayhew's filming only lasted a day. Only Mayhew's blue eyes could be seen in his costume, but fans easily recognize him by his gestures, and his co-workers claimed the ability to tell when a stand-in was taking his place. Critical reception to The Age of Quarrel has been met with positive reviews and ratings. Vincent Jeffries of AllMusic awards it four-and-a-half out of five stars and claims in hindsight that "the Cro-Mags helped define the East Coast hardcore movement with their now legendary debut, Age of Quarrel." He later states that "Age of Quarrel is loaded with hardcore classics like 'World Peace,' 'We Gotta Know,' and 'Street Justice.' On these cuts and throughout the record, Mayhew presents what were at the time cutting-edge post-Mot√∂rhead punk/metal riffs, and the entire group execute their roles with passion, dexterity, and extreme focus.
