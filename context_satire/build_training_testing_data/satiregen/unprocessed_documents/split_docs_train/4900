 He forged his views of war and the military as a young man in mine-plagued fields of Vietnam. Now Chuck Hagel may become the first Vietnam veteran and first enlisted soldier to serve as U.S. defense secretary. In nominating him to succeed Leon Panetta, President Barack Obama urged the Senate to confirm a man he said "bears the scars" of that war and has the skill to guide the military through new challenges. "Chuck Hagel is the leader that our troops deserve," Obama said.  Weeks before President Barack Obama announced his nomination for Secretary of Defense; Republicans began lining up against the possible tapping of former GOP Senator Chuck Hagel. Now that Hagel a Vietnam veteran is the official pick, some lawmakers in the president's own party do not seem very thrilled about it either. This includes Democratic Senator from Maryland, Ben Cardin who says Hagel is going to have to clarify some of the things he has said in the past regarding Israel and Iran as well as remarks in 1998 questioning whether an "openly aggressively gay" nominee could be an effective U.S. ambassador. This morning Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) joins “Starting Point,” to weigh in on Hagel’s nomination to be the next Secretary of Defense. The secretary of defense, appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate, is by federal law (10 U.S.C. § 113) the head of the Department of Defense, "the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to Department of Defense", and has "authority, direction and control over the Department of Defense". Because the Constitution vests all military authority in Congress and the president, the statutory authority of the secretary of defense is derived from their constitutional authorities. Since it is impractical for either Congress or the president to participate in every piece of Department of Defense affairs, the secretary of defense, and the secretary's subordinate officials generally exercise military authority.
