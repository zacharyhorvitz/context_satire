The 2020 presidential campaign of Pete Buttigieg is a political campaign for the presidency of the United States by Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. It began with the formation of an exploratory committee for the Democratic nomination on January 23, 2019. The campaign was officially launched on April 14, 2019. Buttigieg is the first openly gay Democratic candidate for president, and the youngest candidate in the 2020 primary race.  If you want to understand how much South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg's place in the 2020 presidential race has changed, take a look at this photo from a rally his campaign held in Des Moines on Tuesday night: The crowd was estimated as more than 1,000 people by the Des Moines Register while some said the number was actually closer to 1,600. Focusing on the specific number misses the point, though. And the point is that there were A LOT of people at the Buttigieg rally. A LOT. On January 23, 2019, Pete Buttigieg announced the formation of an exploratory committee to run for President of the United States in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He had attracted speculation as a potential presidential candidate, notably following his visit to the early caucus state of Iowa in December 2018, where he announced that he would not seek reelection as mayor of South Bend.
