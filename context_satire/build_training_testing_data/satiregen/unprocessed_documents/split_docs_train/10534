Godrich's father Vic died on the day of the recording of strings for "Burn the Witch". According to Godrich, "I literally left him on a fucking table in my house and went and recorded. And it was a very, very emotional day for me. He was a string player as well so it was one of those things where it felt like he would want me to go and just do this." Radiohead performed "Creep" as the opening song of their headline performance at the 2009 Reading Festival. They did not perform it again until 2016, when they played it several times on tour for their ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool. After a fan spent the majority of a concert shouting for it, the band decided to play it to "see what the reaction is, just to see how it feels". They performed it again during the encore of their headline performance at the Glastonbury Festival that year; according to Guardian critic Alexis Petridis, "Given Radioheadâ€™s famously fractious relationship with their first big hit ... the performance of Creep  greeted with something approaching astonished delight." Radiohead have criticised Hail to the Thief. In 2006, Yorke told Spin: "I'd maybe change the playlist. I think we had a meltdown when we put it together ... We wanted to do things quickly, and I think the songs suffered." In 2008, he posted an alternative, shorter track list on Radiohead's website.
