The Heritage Foundation (abbreviated to Heritage) is an American conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C., primarily geared towards public policy. The foundation took a leading role in the conservative movement during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, whose policies were taken from Heritage's policy study Mandate for Leadership. Since then, The Heritage Foundation has continued to have a significant influence in U.S. public policy making, and is considered to be one of the most influential conservative public policy organizations in the United States.  It's July 2019 in Washington, and President Donald Trump is again attacking Paul Ryan, a feud that might have died with the former House speaker's retirement in January. But the on-again, off-again duo is back in the spotlight thanks to new comments in a forthcoming book and Trump has found the time to punch back about Ryan's assertions the President doesn't understand government. "American Carnage" by Politico's Tim Alberta depicts a Republican Party that at first struggled with Trump's rise during the campaign before gradually coming to terms with him as President, according to a report by The Washington Post, which obtained a copy of the book. Alberta writes that Ryan left Congress in January because he couldn't bear the thought of another two years with Trump and saw retirement as an "escape hatch."
