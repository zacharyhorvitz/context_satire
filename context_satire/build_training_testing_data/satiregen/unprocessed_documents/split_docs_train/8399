 President Donald Trump said he is "not familiar" with the Harvey Weinstein case when asked for his reaction to the former Hollywood producer being charged with rape and sex abuse Friday. Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House that he didn't "know anything about it," but added, "It's really too bad. Really too bad." In October, when the flood of accusations from dozens of women began to come out against Weinstein, Trump told reporters at the time: "I've known Harvey Weinstein for a long time, I'm not at all surprised to see it."  Harvey Weinstein is expected to turn himself in to the NYPD on Friday morning on charges that he raped one woman and forced another to perform oral sex on him, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. Manhattan prosecutors will charge Weinstein with first- and third-degree rape in one case and first-degree sex act in a second case, the source said. Weinstein's New York-based attorney, Benjamin Brafman, on Thursday declined to comment on whether his client would turn himself in. The disgraced Hollywood producer is also under investigation for alleged sex crimes in Los Angeles and London.  Seven months after women began coming forward with stories alleging sexual misconduct by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, the former movie mogul has been arraigned on charges of rape and committing a criminal sexual act in the first degree. The Manhattan District Attorney's office says Friday's charges relate to incidents with two separate women in 2013 and 2004. More charges are expected as a grand jury continues to hear testimony in the state's case with at least four women expected to testify, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment or assault in alleged incidents that span several decades.
