The American Dream is the belief that through hard work and determination, any United States immigrant can achieve a better life, usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom of choice. According to historians, the rapid economic and industrial expansion of the U.S. is not simply a function of being a resource rich, hard working, and inventive country, but the belief that anybody could get a share of the country's wealth if he or she was willing to work hard. This dream has been a major factor in attracting immigrants to the United States.  Even by President Donald Trump's standards, his current efforts to whip up hatred of immigrants seem extraordinarily brazen. As a group of about 3,500 migrants (already diminishing in size) trudge slowly up through Mexico toward the American border, Trump is going all out to turn them into a key to election victory next Tuesday. What other president can you imagine:         — Falsely proclaiming that these migrants are "invaders" who pose a serious threat to the United States? — Sending over 5,000 troops to the border to protect the border (that's over one troop per migrant)?  I am a birthright citizen. My parents, enchanted by the promise of a better life and working their way into American society, planted their Indian roots in a northern Jersey suburb in the early 1980s where a dozen or so of my other family members would eventually migrate over the next two decades. We would go on to become cooks, mailmen, doctors, journalists, nurses and real estate agents, and disperse along the East Coast to places like New York, Washington, North Carolina, Virginia and Connecticut. But the American dream that my mother and father realized nearly 40 years ago, beyond JFK's terminal gates with green cards in hand, is under attack.
