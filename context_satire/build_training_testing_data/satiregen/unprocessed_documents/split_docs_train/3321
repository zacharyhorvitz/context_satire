National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) is an American financial planning trade organization created in 1983 to expand the use of fee-only financial advisors by individual consumers. NAPFA established the first set of professional standards for fee-only financial advisors and has updated them to reflect changes in industry practices. NAPFA members are distinguished from other financial professionals in several ways. Adherence to a fee-only standard is strict: NAPFA members cannot accept compensation in any form from any source other than their clients.

NAPFA established the first set of professional standards for fee-only financial advisors and has updated them to reflect changes in industry practices. Over the years, NAPFA's influence has resulted in greater awareness and adoption of fee-only principles by leading financial advisors, other major financial industry trade associations, and government regulations. Since 2008, NAPFA has joined with two other organizations in the Financial Planning Coalition (FPC) to push for greater change for consumers, at a time when an economic downturn and investment scandals have affected the financial security of nearly all Americans. NAPFA, the Financial Planning Association, and the CFP Board of Standards formed the Financial Planning Coalition to work with Congress and federal agencies to strengthen the rules on financial advisors' fiduciary conduct, fee disclosures, and conflicts of interest.
