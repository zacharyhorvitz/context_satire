 Google is still considering whether to launch a censored version of its search product in China, CEO Sundar Pichai said Monday. "It's very early. We don't know whether we could or would do this in China, but we felt it was important for us to explore," Pichai said at the Wired25 conference in San Francisco. The company publicly confirmed the existence of the controversial project during a Senate committee hearing in late September. In March 2016, Blue Origin invited journalists to see the inside of its Kent, Washington headquarters and manufacturing facility for the first time. The company was planning for substantial growth in 2016 as it planned to build more crew capsules and propulsion modules for the New Shepard program and ramp up BE-4 engine builds to support full-scale development testing. Blue indicated that employment was expected to grow to 1,000 in 2016 from 600 in February 2016. Bezos also articulated a long-term vision for humans in space, seeing the potential to move much heavy industry completely off-Earth, "leaving our planet zoned strictly for 'residential and light industrial' use with an end state hundreds of years out "where millions of people would be living and working in space."  Amazon's search for the perfect home for its next headquarters could be leaning towards larger cities. Executives have visited some of the bigger names on the list of 20 finalists in recent months, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. They dropped in on New York City, Miami, Chicago and Newark, while possibly ghosting smaller or more suburban ares like Raleigh, North Carolina, and Montgomery County, Maryland. Amazon may have decided that a city is necessary for luring the best employees.
