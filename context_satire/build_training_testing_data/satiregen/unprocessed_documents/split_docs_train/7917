 A devastating analysis from the Congressional Budget Office on the House GOP bill to repeal Obamacare has rattled moderate Republicans in the House, who are uneasy about the prospects of voting for a proposal that increasingly appears dead on arrival in the Senate. Florida Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said publicly Tuesday that she wouldn't be able to support the GOP health care legislation after the CBO score revealed the high number of people who would lose insurance. "I plan to vote NO on the current #AHCA bill. As written the plan leaves too many from my #SoFla district uninsured," the Florida congresswoman wrote in two consecutive tweets.  A vote on legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare has been delayed, as Republicans haggle furiously over just how destructive they can agree to be. But perhaps this delay offers a chance for Republicans in the House to take a deep breath and realize what this is really about: a political win for the Republican leadership and the Trump White House. This is not an effort to make health care more accessible and affordable for Americans. Health care policy is never easy politics, but because dismantling the present health care system would have such a profound effect on American citizens, it represents a test of leadership and character for members of Congress.  A new poll finds that many Americans are not optimistic about what the GOP health care bill will do to their coverage. Although President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress promise that their plan will cover more people and cost less, nearly half of Americans don't believe it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll released Wednesday. And while many Republicans are confident that defunding Planned Parenthood is the right move, the greater majority oppose that idea, it says. This is the latest poll on the legislation from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.
