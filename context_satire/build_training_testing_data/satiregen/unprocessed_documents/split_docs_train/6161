 Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang said Tuesday his idea to give Americans a universal basic income of $1,000 a month would be a "game changer." Yang, who has centered his campaign around the policy proposal, told CNN's John Berman on "New Day" that the plan would spur economic growth and create new jobs to supplement ones lost to automation. "If you get pushed out of a job by automation, how is $12,000 a year going to change your life?" Berman asked.  Americans borrowed a staggering $88 billion in the past year to pay for health care, a new survey finds. About 1 in 8 had to resort to borrowing to afford care in the previous year, according to a West Health-Gallup survey released Tuesday. Also, 65 million adults say they had a health issue but didn't seek treatment due to cost. Nearly a quarter had to cut back on spending to pay for health care or medicine.  White Americans and people of color don't agree on much regarding race relations, except for the fact that they're generally bad, according to a new survey released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center. Of those surveyed, 58% overall said race relations are generally bad. Blacks were the most likely to have said that race relations are bad (71%), followed by 60% of Hispanics, and 56% of whites. More than half of Americans said race relations are getting worse, 30% staying the same, and a low 17% said they're getting better.
