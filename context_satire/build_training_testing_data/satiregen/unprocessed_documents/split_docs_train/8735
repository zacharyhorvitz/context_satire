 Martin O'Malley is planning to tie his struggling Democratic presidential bid to the opposing party when he hosts a gun control event Wednesday, the same day as the third Republican debate. At the event, which will be held at the University of Colorado Boulder, the former Maryland governor will "challenge every single (GOP) candidate on that stage Wednesday night to value lives over whatever pressure they are getting from the NRA,"  Haley Morris, spokeswoman for O'Malley said Tuesday. O'Malley will be joined by Lonnie and Sandy Phillips, two vocal O'Malley supporters who lost their daughter, Jessica Ghawi, in the 2012 shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. The event will be announced Tuesday in an email from the Phillips family.  Carly Fiorina has to prove this week that she can become more than the star of the Republican debate team. Fiorina rocketed from a little-known, first-time presidential candidate to one of the Republican Party's top-tier contenders thanks to well-reviewed debate performances in August and September. But she has virtually vanished since. Carly Fiorina's fall  Wednesday's debate will give Fiorina another chance to make a good impression and generate some positive headlines.  Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina is picking a fight with the only other woman in the presidential race, writing that Democratic policies have helped the richest in the nation and hurt the nation's middle class. Fiorina, who saw a sizable bump in support after her performance at the second Republican debate but has since seen her support fade, hit back against Hillary Clinton's stump line that the economy does better under Democrats. "People at the top seem to be doing just fine under the policies she extols," Fiorina writes in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published late Monday. She added later, "That's because big government only works for big business, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected."
