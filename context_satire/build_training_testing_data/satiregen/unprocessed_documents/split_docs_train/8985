 Heading into Sunday's Super Bowl, there isn't much Patriots and Eagles fans can agree on -- except when it comes to "This Is Us." As supporters of these two football teams await a bitter fight for victory, those who also happen to be fans of the NBC drama know that the episode set to premiere following the game will be a ringer. Show creator Dan Fogelman has promised the episode will answer all the questions that have been lingering in the minds of loyal viewers about the death of Pearson family patriarch Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). The series has made the character's demise something of a mystery, hinting only over the last two seasons Jack's death occurs while his children are in their teen years and that it involves a house fire.  Donald Trump was nowhere to be seen on Sunday night at the Super Bowl. Unlike his recent predecessors, Trump decided against doing a halftime interview with the host network (NBC in this case). He didn't tweet during the game. And, with the exception of one local TV commercial in Washington that featured a Trump impersonator -- yes, really -- the President wasn't mentioned during the duration of the five-hour telecast.  In the age of YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, why are marketers still willing to throw down millions of dollars for a 30-second Super Bowl ad? It's simple. The NFL's marquee event is TV's biggest game in town, and nothing else even comes close. "A lot of the trends that we've seen in the media world over the past decade have only made the Super Bowl more important," said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.
