 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who jumped into the Republican primary in July as a front-runner in the key early state of Iowa, suspended his campaign Monday. While Walker did not mention Donald Trump by name in his announcement to suspend his campaign, he encouraged other Republican candidates "to consider doing the same, so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive, conservative alternative to the current front-runner." He said this is "fundamentally important to the future of the party."  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker on Sunday defended his troubled presidential campaign, citing his record as a Republican governor in a blue state as his key to success. "If you want someone who will fight and win... and get results without compromising common sense conservative principles, then I'm the candidate," Walker told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview that aired Sunday on "State of the Union." Walker's comments come as he's plummeted to 10th place in Iowa, pulling in just 3% of the vote, according to the latest Quinnipiac poll released Friday.  GOP presidential candidate Scott Walker took the hardline crackdown on unions that made him a national figure in Wisconsin to the presidential campaign trail on Monday. The Wisconsin governor appeared in Las Vegas for a campaign town hall where he announced his labor policies. The proposals largely resembled the policies he pushed through as governor of Wisconsin, the fight over which made him a national figure and resulted in his being recalled -- an election he won handily. "Just like President Reagan, I believe we need to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.," Walker said Monday.
