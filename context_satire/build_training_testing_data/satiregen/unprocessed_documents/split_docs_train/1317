 In the biggest speech of his still young political career, GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan told the Republican National Convention on Wednesday that time is running out to solve the nation's fiscal problems, but Mitt Romney and he can do it if elected in November. "We will not duck the tough issues -- we will lead," Ryan said in his prime time address televised nationwide. "... The work ahead will be hard.  U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan's prime-time address Wednesday at the Republican National Convention put his fiscal acumen on display, but Mitt Romney's running mate also made an effort to show delegates -- and millions of television viewers -- the man behind the numbers. "We're a full generation apart, Gov. Romney and I," the seven-term Wisconsin congressman said toward the end of his speech, a reminder to voters that Ryan stands as the first member of Generation X to run on a major party's presidential ticket. "I hope it's not a deal-breaker, Mitt, but my playlist starts with AC/DC, and ends with Zeppelin," the 42-year-old Wisconsin lawmaker cracked as the audience roared.

The Wisconsin congressman evoked both when he took the stage on Wednesday night and delivered a prime-time acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention that skewered what the GOP sees as President Barack Obama's failed economic policies. With Ryan, 42, holding down the No. 2 spot, the ticket hopes to strengthen his Generation X demographic ahead of November and broaden the campaign's appeal to a wealth of younger voters, a much more challenging prospect.
