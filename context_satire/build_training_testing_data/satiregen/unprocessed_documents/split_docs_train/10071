The AAGJSSCTEJUVA is perhaps the most secret secret society at the University of Virginia with its roots dating back to the late 1940s. In addition to the group's full name being secret, the exact mission of The AAGJSSCTEJUVA has yet to be uncovered. However, a manifesto from November 7, 2000 revealed that the group has historically harbored ambitions to destroy the McIntire School of Commerce and obliterate corporate power at UVA. Additionally, a recent leak in the Society's archives revealed that The AAGJSSCTEJUVA's major communications and activities have historically been initiated by an amorphous figure known as "The Simulator." Like Eli Banana, the Tilkas combined a focus on student leadership with a social function. Dabney notes that from the 1920s to the 1950s both organizations regularly sponsored formal dances at the university. The organizations were sufficiently integrated into student life by the late 1940s that a Virginia Glee Club album of University songs included the Tilka anthem ("Come Fill Your Glasses Up for T.I.L.K.A. "). The Sons and Daughters of Liberty were established in the early 2000s, and are said to pursue liberty while decrying tyranny. Though the judgements passed by the SDL are done in secrecy, it is well known and documented that they stand firmly against the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society, the most notable debating society of The University. The SDL began when the Sons of Liberty were founded in the early 2000s. Shortly after, the Daughters of Liberty were founded, and the two combined to form the Sons and Daughters of Liberty.
