The film spans one week, beginning with Monday, in the life of Paterson, a bus driver in Paterson, New Jersey. Every day follows much the same pattern: Paterson gets up early and goes to work, where he listens to passengers talking and, during pauses, writes poetry in a notebook he carries with him. After work he walks Marvin, his wife's dog, and stops for a beer at Shades Bar, where he interacts with the other patrons and the owner, Doc (Barry Shabaka Henley). On April 25, 2012, Padgett was hired by new head coach Bennie Seltzer to the coaching staff at Samford in Birmingham, Alabama. When Seltzer was dismissed in June 2014, Padgett was promoted to head coach of the Bulldogs. On April 16, 2009 it was announced that Padgett would be returning to his alma mater along with his former college teammate Tony Delk to serve on coach John Calipari's staff at the University of Kentucky. Padgett left Kentucky to take a job coaching at Manhattan College for the 2010â€“2011 season where he served as an assistant under former teammate Steve Masiello.
