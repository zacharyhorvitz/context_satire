Her first acting roles began in 2010 in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, in the episode "Branded", in which she played the character Hannah Milner; and in the television series Curb Your Enthusiasm in the episode "Mister Softee", as Emily. Her family moved to the United States when she was nine so that her father could take a job as a security consultant in Alabama. When she arrived, Rush could speak only Hebrew. She attended N.E. Miles Jewish Day School in Birmingham, Alabama, where she lived. As described in a film magazine, while attending a house party with her husband, Eleanor Stratton (Frederick) overhears a conversation between a detective Jim Foley (Hatch) and her husband Frederick (Kent), in which the latter is commanded to produce a receipt held by Worthington Lawrence (Handyside), their host, under penalty of being exposed for a petty theft committed years ago. To save her husband, Eleanor obtains the receipt and motors to the city the next day with it, where Foley has promised to deliver to her the signed confession of her husband. Foley tricks her up to his rooms, where he obtains the receipt but fails to deliver the confession. He promises to give it to her if she will return that evening.
