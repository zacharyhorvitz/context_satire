Instead of settling down at home as a spinster caring for her mother, Kenny continued to work as a nurse from their home. Her neighbor Stan Kuhn took her to her patients in his motorcycle sidecar or automobile. When his daughter Sylvia fell into the path of his horse-drawn plow, he carried her home and called Kenny. She quickly improvised a stretcher from a cupboard  door for badly injured Sylvia, carefully secured her to it and rode with her in the local ambulance 26 miles to Dr McDonnell's office. On Phoenix's performance, Kent Jones of Film Comment noted, "Freddie is not so much played as nuzzled, and jerked into being by Joaquin Phoenix. I'm Still Here aside, Phoenix's Freddie seems like genuinely damaged goods. He and his director feel their way into this man-in-a-bind from the inside out, and they establish his estrangement from others in those opening scenes through awkward smiles and out-of-sync body language alone". "As always with Anderson", Jones continued, "the character opposition borders on the schematic, and the structure threatens to come apart at the seams. There have been several interpretations of what The Master is really about. Some have viewed it as an existential tale of post-war America, while others have viewed it as a depiction of the birth of Scientology. Some have argued that the film is also mainly a love story between Lancaster Dodd and Freddie Quell; Dana Stevens of Slate commented that "After three viewings, I'm still not sure I know the answer to the "what's it all about" question, but I lean  The Master is above all a love story between Joaquin Phoenix's damaged World War II vet, Freddie Quell, and Philip Seymour Hoffmann's charismatic charlatan, Lancaster Dodd. And that relationship is powerful and funny and twisted and strange enough that maybe that's all the movie needs to be about."
