The College Football All-America Team is an honorific college football all-star team compiled after each NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) season to recognize that season's most outstanding performers at their respective positions. There are several organizations that select their own All-America teams. Since 1924, the NCAA has designated selectors whose teams are used to determine "consensus" and "unanimous" All-Americans. Any player who is named to the first team by at least half the official selectors for a given season is recognized as being a consensus All-American. Unanimous All-Americans are considered "elite, the cream of the crop from any particular season." Many are later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, and many also go on to have successful professional football careers. From 1924 to 2000, 364 players were unanimous selections at least once. Thus, only a handful of players—if any—each season receive the honor. As of the end of the 2019 Division I FBS season, Ohio State and Oklahoma have had the most unanimous All-America selections of any school with 35 each, followed by Alabama and Notre Dame with 34 each. Eighty-five schools have had at least one unanimous All-America selection; the most recent school to produce its first unanimous All-American is Florida Atlantic, doing so in 2019. The most recent All-America team, that of 2019, included 16 unanimous selections.
