 Dozens of senators attempted to take swipes at Mark Zuckerberg in his debut on Capitol Hill. None appeared to land a significant blow. The Facebook CEO formally apologized to Congress on Tuesday for mistakes that led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal and stressed that his company is rethinking its responsibility to users and society. "It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well.  Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie says the data the firm gathered from Facebook could have come from more than 87 million users and could be stored in Russia. The number of Facebook users whose personal information was accessed by Cambridge Analytica "could be higher, absolutely," than the 87 million users acknowledged by Facebook, Wylie told NBC's Chuck Todd during a "Meet the Press" segment Sunday. Wylie added that his lawyer has been contacted by US authorities, including congressional investigators and the Department of Justice, and says he plans to cooperate with them. "We're just setting out dates that I can actually go and sit down and meet with the authorities," he said.  Facebook is facing another investigation over revelations that information from tens of millions of its users were accessed by data research firm Cambridge Analytica. The Philippines is the latest country to launch an official inquiry, with regulators saying on Friday that CEO Mark Zuckerberg had not sufficiently explained what went wrong. "We acknowledge the communications of your global and regional representatives made directly to our office," the Philippines National Privacy Commission said in a letter addressed to Zuckerberg dated April 11. "Unfortunately, your response has been generic and inadequate to satisfy the mounting concerns of Filipino users," the regulator wrote in the letter, which was published by the government on Friday.
