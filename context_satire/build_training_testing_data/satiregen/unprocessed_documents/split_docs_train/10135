On The Ellen DeGeneres Show, when questioned about always being glamorous and beautiful, Romijn revealed that in her early teens, she was in fact an insecure "drama geek" and that, as a result of her growth spurt, she suffered from scoliosis and was constantly in pain. Many sources say that she was once nicknamed the "Jolly Blonde Giant" because of her 5-foot-11-inch (1.80Â m) height, but she has admitted to making that up "for a laugh". While studying Music (Voice) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, she became involved with fashion modeling and eventually moved to Paris, where she lived for more than three years. Life in the Iron Mills; or, The Korl Woman is widely considered Rebecca Harding Davis's most significant work. Published in 1861 in The Atlantic Monthly, Life in the Iron Mills was one of the first works to explore industrialization in American literature. The novella saw its publication around the dawn of the American Civil War, and is one of Davis's earliest published works. It has become an important text not only for its artistic merit, but for its historical implications. Born in Los Angeles, California, Davis began her career acting in commercials at the age of three years. She played Sarah Powell on Charles in Charge for four seasons. Sarah Powell was a quiet, bookish character, and after Charles in Charge wrapped, Davis had a difficult time shedding that image and getting people to forget the character she created and to see her as outgoing.
