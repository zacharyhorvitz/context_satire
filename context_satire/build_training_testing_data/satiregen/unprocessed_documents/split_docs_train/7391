 On a brightly lit stage before a crowd of thousands, an animated Pope Francis rallied his followers to focus on family in a fiery homily on love and faith.

The pontiff spoke in Spanish and paused at each line to let an English translator chime in. "Love is celebration.  He introduced himself as a brother, a son of immigrants, a neighbor from beyond our southern border. He came to remind our politicians of the country's founding principles and to encourage them to protect our families and our earth from an uncertain future. In a country where Christianity often comes wrapped in an American flag, he said that we are better when we work together, when we don't set aside our differences but celebrate them -- wherever we are from, whatever God we worship. He came to meet us, finally, to look into our eyes and share our struggles.  Pope Francis has returned to Rome, leaving the United States with "a heart full of gratitude and hope" after a hectic trip. The Pope packed a lot of hugs, handshakes, blessings and political admonitions into a period of less than a week that took him to the halls of Washington power, the U.N. General Assembly and drew throngs of admirers to hear him celebrate Mass. On the plane back to Rome, he gave reporters his first impression of Americans. The warmth he encountered in the United States surprised him, as well as the varying forms it took in the cities he visited.
