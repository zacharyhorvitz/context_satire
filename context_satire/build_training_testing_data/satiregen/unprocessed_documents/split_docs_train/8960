Deborah Ann Woll was born on February 7, 1985 in Brooklyn, New York. Her father is an architect and her mother, Cathy Woll, is a teacher at the Berkeley Carroll School. She is of Jewish German and Irish descent. She attended the Packer Collegiate Institute for high school, and received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from USC School of Dramatic Arts at the University of Southern California. This method of suicide is relatively rare due to the long and painful experience one has to go through before death sets in. This is also contributed to by the ever-present risk that the fire be extinguished before death sets in, and in that way causes one to live with severe burnings, scar tissue, and the emotional impact of such injuries. In February 2011, while on tour in upstate New York, Miller and his friends were arrested for possession of marijuana for which they spent the night in jail. Miller said the case was "settled".
