In July 1985, Collins took part in the Live Aid concerts, a continuation of the fundraising effort started by Band Aid. Collins was the only performer to appear at the London concert at Wembley Stadium and the U.S. concert at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia on the same day. After he performed "Against All Odds" and "In the Air Tonight" and sang alongside Sting, Collins travelled to Philadelphia via Concorde to perform his solo material, play drums for Clapton, and drum with Plant and Jimmy Page for a Led Zeppelin reunion. The latter performance was poorly received and later disowned by the band. In February 1984, Collins released "Against All Odds", the main theme for the film of the same title. The song was produced by Arif Mardin, and is one of the few songs released by Collins that he did not co-produce himself. The single, more pop-orientated and commercially accessible than Collins's previous work, became his first solo single to top the Billboard Hot 100, reached number two on the UK Singles Chart, and earned him the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male. Collins is sometimes reported in the British press to have left the UK and moved to Switzerland in protest at the Labour Party's victory in the 1997 general election. Shortly before the 2005 election (when Collins was living in Switzerland), Labour supporter Noel Gallagher was quoted: "Vote Labour. If you don't and the Tories get in, Phil Collins is threatening to come back and live here. And let's face it, none of us want that."
