 Tonight, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art rolled out the red carpet for the Met Gala, the annual opening party for its spring exhibition. The invite-only event is also a fundraiser for the museum's Costume Institute. Celebrities -- including co-chairs Rihanna, Amal Clooney, Donatella Versace and Anna Wintour -- dressed to the theme of the show, "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination." Singers Katy Perry and Rihanna wore some of the night's most memorable ensembles.  Bold, creative and over-the-top perfectly sums up the 2018 Met Gala -- a benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute -- held Monday night. It's fashion's biggest night and this year's theme was "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination." The gala, which is annually held on the first Monday in May, was hosted by Rihanna, Amal Clooney, Donatella Versace, Anna Wintour and Stephen and Christine Schwarzman. Given the theme, there was a lot of religious imagery, complete with headpieces and lots of crosses.  Just when it seemed like the fury surrounding the chaplain for the US House of Representatives was over. As House members were wrapping up votes Tuesday night, a remarkably heated exchange erupted on the floor, with one congressman shouting, aggressively pointing his finger, and -- at one point -- banging his fist on a table as he sharply criticized another member. Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley of New York attempted to offer a resolution to form a committee to investigate the forced resignation of the Rev. Pat Conroy, the House chaplain.
