Jackson's Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 became the most successful debut tour in history and set a record for the fastest sell-out of Japan's Tokyo Dome. She established the "Rhythm Nation Scholarship," donating funds from the tour to various educational programs. As Jackson began her tour, she was acknowledged for the cultural impact of her music. Joel Selvin of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote "the 23-year-old has been making smash hit records for four years, becoming a fixture on MTV and a major role model to teenage girls across the country", and William Allen, then-executive vice president of the United Negro College Fund, told the Los Angeles Times, "Jackson is a role model for all young people to emulate and the message she has gotten to the young people of this country through the lyrics of 'Rhythm Nation 1814' is having positive effects." Amidst mourning with her family, she focused on work to deal with the grief, avoiding any news coverage of her sibling's death. She commented, "it's still important to face reality, and not that I'm running, but sometimes you just need to get away for a second." During this time, she ended her seven-year relationship with Jermaine Dupri. Vulture's Ziwe Fumudoh gave the episode a 5 out of 5. Much like Rosenfield, she praised the return of Angela Bassett and Jessica Lange, commenting "do you understand how privileged we are to watch an episode of television with Angela Bassett, Jessica Lange, and Sarah Paulson?" She was a fan of the showdown between the witches and Langdon, even if the deaths of Madison, Marie and Coco were "laughable". She also enjoyed the death of Langdon, saying that "it's mean but so delicious", and Lange's "impeccable monologue" at the start of the scene.
