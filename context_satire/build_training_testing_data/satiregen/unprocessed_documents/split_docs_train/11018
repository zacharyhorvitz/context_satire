Beatrice Janet Trew (December 4, 1897 - June 4, 1976) was born on December 4, 1897, in Coates Mills, New Brunswick. She received teacher training in Fredericton and moved to a school at Manor, Saskatchewan in 1917. The following year she taught at Lemsford, where she met and married J. Albert Trew, a district farmer. When the 'Lemsford Homemakers Club' was formed in 1920, she was elected first secretary-treasurer. In December 2004, after a long period of silence, Farmer held a press conference announcing her new album, Avant que l'ombre... and the single "Fuck Them All" as well as a special 13-night concert engagement at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in January 2006. This era featured no further promotion, and marked a new level of reclusivity for the star, who simply stated "What I have to say is in my music". She also announced her new series of concerts in Paris-Bercy, a show designed by Mark Fisher. She explained that she could not tour due to the complex sets of the performances of the show, which featured two stages, a mobile bridge to link the two stages and a curtain of words written with water. In 2014, Alizée revealed plans to include a song named for Farmer on her Blonde album. The song, written by Lionel Florence, tells the story of an obsessed fan. Alizée revealed in an interview that the song is meant to pay tribute and respect to Farmer. Although the two no longer work together, she mentioned that she is still a big fan.
