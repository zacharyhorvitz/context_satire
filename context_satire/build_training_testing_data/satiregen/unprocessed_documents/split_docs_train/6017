On October 14, 2008 Ivan Seidenberg stated as reported in the WSJ: "Verizon CEO No Bailout for Me, Thanks,"   Seidenberg clearly indicated that Verizon was in great shape and would not take any TARP money. Despite subsequent allegations and reports to the contrary, Verizon did not take TARP money. The Federal Reserve Bank bought $1.5 billion of Verizon's short term (90 days) commercial paper. The funds for the purchase of the short term IOUs, from several corporations, did not come from the TARP program.
