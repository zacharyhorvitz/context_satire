The school board elected to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. Originally laid out in 1828 by John Strattan Sr., Strattanville lays claim to be the oldest town in Clarion County. Indeed, the first settlement of the town predates the county by 11 years. In 1850 the village incorporated into a borough. As one of the three original towns of Clarion County, it was once in consideration for the county seat. The District received $878.499 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009â€“10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, Clarion-Limestone Area School District had 327 students receiving free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007-2008 school year.
