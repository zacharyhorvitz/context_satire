The Provasic drug is to be presented at a pharmaceutical conference at the Chicago Hilton & Towers Hotel. As Kimble takes an elevated train there to confront Nichols, Sykes appears and attacks him. In the struggle, Sykes shoots a transit cop before being subdued and handcuffed to a pole by Kimble. At the conference, Kimble interrupts Nichols' speech, confronting him about falsifying medical research and orchestrating the murder of Kimble's wife. Kimble returns to Chicago to hunt for the real murderer. Once there, he acquires money from his friend and colleague Dr. Charles Nichols. Posing as a janitor, Kimble enters Cook County Hospital's prosthetic department to obtain a list of people who had prosthetic arms repaired shortly after his wife's murder. While there, Kimble realizes that a young patient has been misdiagnosed; Kimble forges new doctor's orders for the patient (saving his life), but is later confronted by a hospital physician who realizes that Kimble is not who he claims to be. The film was not without its detractors. Geoff Andrew of Time Out viewed the film as "A glossy, formula chase movie with the requisite number of extravagant action sequences". The critic added, "Ford is up to par for the strenuous stuff, but falls short on the grief, anxiety and compassion, allowing Tommy Lee Jones to walk away with the show as the wisecracking marshal on Kimble's trail." In a formulaic fashion, columnist Ethan Ham writing for the Bright Lights Film Journal speculated that supporting actor Tommy Lee Jones' character was "much more disturbing than the inept police."
