In 1991, Cunningham's season came to an abrupt end when he was tackled by Bryce Paup of the Green Bay Packers and tore his anterior cruciate ligament in the first game of the season. He would return to the Eagles completely healed the following season, and led the team to its first playoff victory in 12 years. However, it was evident that the injury he suffered took away much of his speed and athleticism. The 1993 and 1994 seasons would be riddled by a series of nagging injuries and a transition to the West Coast Offense that eventually led to his benching in favor of veteran Rodney Peete. After playing college football at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Cunningham was selected in the second round of the 1985 NFL Draft by the Eagles, with whom he remained through the 1995 season. Following 11 seasons with the team, he announced his retirement from football, but returned after a year away from the game to join the Vikings. In 1998, Cunningham enjoyed the strongest season of his career and helped the team set the NFL record for most points in a regular season at the time, although the Vikings would be upset in the NFC Championship Game. He was released by the Vikings following the 1999 season after failing to match his success during the previous year. Ward is credited with the idea: "The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer." This refers to the observation that people are quicker to correct a wrong answer than to answer a question. According to Steven McGeady, Cunningham advised him of this on a whim in the early 1980s, and McGeady dubbed this Cunningham's law. Although originally referring to interactions on Usenet, the law has been used to describe how other online communities work, such as Wikipedia.
