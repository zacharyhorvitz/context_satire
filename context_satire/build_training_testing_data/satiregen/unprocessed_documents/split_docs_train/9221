Slice was born in South Boston, Virginia and attended Halifax County High School. Slide's collaboration with Scratchmaster Chuck T. (Charles Fulp) included the underground rap hit "Thinking of You," which led to Slice's being signed by Jive Records. Their album The Electric Slide (Shall We Dance) came out in 1991. Rock musicians began exploring electric slide guitar in the early 1960s. In the UK,  groups like the Rolling Stones, who were fans of Chicago blues and Chess Records artists in particular, began recording songs by Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and others. The Stones' second single, "I Wanna Be Your Man" (1963), featured a slide guitar break by Brian Jones, which may be the first appearance of a slide on a rock record. Critic Richie Unterberger commented, "Particularly outstanding was Brian Jones's slide guitar, whose wailing howl gave the tune a raunchy bluesiness missing in the Beatles' more straightforward rock 'n' roll arrangement." The song was also part of an eleven track album, Cha Cha Slide: The Original Slide Album, released in September 2000. Originally aimed at aerobics sessions and night clubs alike, the song is often played at dance clubs, school PE/dances/proms, parties, ice and roller skating rinks, bar mitzvahs, weddings, and sporting events in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and other English-speaking countries.
