 When Barack Obama traveled to Cuba in 2016, he vowed to reshape relations not just with the Communist-run island but with all of Latin America. The last US President to visit Cuba had been Calvin Coolidge. That was 80 years ago -- and he had arrived accompanied by gunboats. Obama promised that the future would be different, no matter what political differences remained between the US and Latin America.  A line of questioning related to the US special representative for Venezuela's credibility and past statements on human rights led to a contentious exchange during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing Wednesday. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, raised the issue of Elliott Abrams' role in the Iran-Contra affair -- he pleaded guilty in 1991 to two misdemeanor counts for withholding information to Congress while he was the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs. "I fail to understand why members of this committee or the American people should find any testimony that you give today to be truthful," Omar said. When Abrams attempted to respond, she told him it was "not a question," to which Abrams countered that it was "an attack."  The House adopted a resolution Wednesday calling for the end of any US military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which was deemed the world's worst humanitarian crisis last year by the United Nations. The measure passed 248-177, with one voting present. The resolution directs the President to remove any US armed forces that are affecting the war with Yemen, with the exception of forces fighting Al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula, in less than 30 days after the resolution is enacted It's expected at some point that the Senate will take up the resolution, but it's not clear when. In a rare move, Democrats agreed to a procedural step sought by Republicans to add language to the resolution.
