In 1998, when the team was enfranchised by Major League Baseball's National League, KTVK became the original over-the-air broadcaster of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Television rights to the team's games remained with KTVK through the end of the 2007 season, when the team opted to move all of its English-language broadcasts (not counting national telecasts) to cable on regional sports network Fox Sports Arizona. In the fall of 1998, KTVK briefly aired The Howard Stern Radio Show; both KTVK (which aired the program after its 10 p.m. news) and Lubbock, Texas Fox affiliate KJTV-TV pulled the program from their schedules after two episodes. On March 1, 2009, KPNX began to share a news helicopter operated by Helicopters Inc., as part of a Local News Service agreement with KPHO-TV and KTVK; the helicopter is named "News Chopper 20", as a combination of the over-the-air virtual channel numbers of the three stations (3, 5 and 12). In November 2009, KPNX's newscasts were beaten by KPHO in the ratings at 10 p.m., ending 50 consecutive sweeps victories in the timeslot (dating back to 1996) as the latter's ratings increased due to CBS' strong primetime lineup. KPNX, traditionally known as a very news-intensive station, went through a period of transition when nearly all of its tenured reporters left. Sports programming on KPHO includes select Arizona Cardinals games through the NFL on CBS, primarily home contests where an American Football Conference team is the opponent. Channel 5 also carries CBS' broadcast of the PGA Tour's Phoenix Open held at TPC Scottsdale every February (because the golf tournament is played on Super Bowl weekend, coverage will shift to KPNX in years when CBS has the Super Bowl). Also, any Arizona State Sun Devils and Arizona Wildcats appearances in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament picked up by CBS will air on the station.
