 Donald Trump is training his sights on Ohio Gov. John Kasich ahead of Tuesday's winner-take-all Ohio primary. The Republican front-runner spent more time here on Sunday attacking the Ohio governor than any other of his presidential rivals. And after spending more time in Ohio this weekend than any other state, Trump on Sunday announced he was scrapping a scheduled event in Florida to instead rally supporters once more in the Buckeye State.  Mitt Romney is hitting the campaign trail again -- barnstorming the Buckeye State with Ohio Gov. John Kasich just days before its pivotal winner-take-all primary. Romney, who has not endorsed any of the presidential hopefuls, will join Kasich at campaign events in North Canton and Westerville, Ohio, on Monday, according to the Kasich campaign. The 2012 Republican nominee is making a campaign trail comeback as part of his escalating efforts to prevent Donald Trump from clinching the Republican nomination. The 2016 presidential campaign of John Kasich, the 69th Governor of Ohio, was announced on July 21, 2015. He was a candidate for the 2016 Republican Party presidential nomination. He earned 154 delegates and won only one contest, his home state, Ohio. Kasich suspended his campaign on May 4, 2016, one day after becoming the last major challenger to Donald Trump for the nomination.
