After a successful night of Trick or Treating on Halloween night, Dustin arrives home to discover that his trash can is moving and making unusual noises. After looking inside the trash can, Dustin discovers a reptilian like creature and hides it in his costume Proton Pack. He places the creature in his turtle tank and names it D'Artagnan, or simply "Dart". The next day Dustin brings D'Artagnan to school to show it to Mike, Lucas, Will, and new addition to the party, Maxine "Max" Mayfield. His upbringing was nonreligious, and he has said, "I don't have any memory of celebrating holidays growing up that were Jewish," and that he had "realized" he was Jewish at around the age of 10. After reuniting with Steve, the two of them, alongside Steve's coworker Robin Buckley, translate the message and conclude that it is a code. While spying on mall patrons to find any Russian spies, Dustin tells Steve that he should ask out Robin because he enjoys her company. While Dustin and Steve fail to find any Russians, Robin manages to break the code, realizing that the Russians have a delivery coming to Starcourt Mall's loading dock that night.
