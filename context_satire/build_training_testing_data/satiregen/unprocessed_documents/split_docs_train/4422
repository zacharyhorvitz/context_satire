When questioned about the Khans during the second presidential debate, Trump claimed that Humayun Khan would be alive had he been President in 2004 and referred to him as an "American hero". The Khans responded by saying that they know that their son is an American hero. As witnesses like Vindman and Yovanovitch gave public testimony, Trump has repeatedly attacked them on Twitter. He often describes them as "people I never heard of" and as "Never Trumpers", suggesting they are motivated only by opposition to his presidency. He tweeted a criticism of Yovanovitch during her testimony, which Schiff read to her while she was still on the stand; she described the effect of such comments as "very intimidating". Attacks on Vindman by the White House and Trump allies, who have questioned his patriotism, have caused him to consult with the Army about possible concerns for his safety and that of his family. In 2011, according to Evan Jones, the headmaster of the New York Military Academy at the time, the then-superintendent Jeffrey Coverdale had demanded Trump's academic records, to hand them over to "prominent, wealthy alumni of the school who were Mr. Trump's friends" at their request. Coverdale said he had refused to hand over Trump's records to trustees of the school, and instead sealed Trump's records on campus. Jones stated: "It was the only time in my education career that I ever heard of someone's record being removed," while Coverdale further said: "It's the only time I ever moved an alumnus's records." The incident reportedly happened days after Trump demanded President Barack Obama's academic records.
