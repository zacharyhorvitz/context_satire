 The four men in green walk calmly down the street, to gentle clapping from the people around them. They appear to be defectors, shown on a video posted to social media from Wednesday in the town of Herran, Colombia. While CNN has not been able to verify the video, the scene is now a common one in Colombia, from a steady drip of Venezuelan soldiers that have given themselves over to Colombian immigration officials over the past week. As of Thursday, an astounding total of 567 had defected.  Venezuela's self-declared interim president, Juan Guaido, returned to the country on Monday, risking arrest for violating a travel ban in his bid to oust embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Guaido was met by crowds of chanting supporters and several European diplomats after he touched down at Caracas airport on Monday, where he declared, "We are here in Venezuela. We are stronger than ever." "We are going to achieve the end of the usurpation very soon in Venezuela," he said.  In a televised address Monday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said the recovery from power outages will be "little by little," adding the outage was an "electronic coup" carried out by "criminal minds." Maduro blamed the US for attacking the power structure, saying the "imperialist government of the United States ordered this attack," but offered no proof for the claim. School and work in the country will be suspended for another 48 hours, Maduro said Monday. "It isn't easy," he said, congratulating the people of Venezuela, and added the country will "recover slowly."
