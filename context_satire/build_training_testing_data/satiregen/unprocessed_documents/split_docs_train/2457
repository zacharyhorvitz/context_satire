 Mattel is probably most known for its hyper-feminine Barbie dolls -- but now, they're making something a little bit different. Mattel launched a line of gender-inclusive dolls Wednesday, called "Creatable World." The line's premise is all about customization -- of hair, clothes and accessories -- creating a toy that isn't dictated by gender norms. Some options are more feminine-presenting, while others are more masculine-presenting, which allows kids to combine the elements any way they want to, said Kim Culmone, senior vice president of Mattel Fashion Doll Design. Barbie's popularity on the toy market began to decline in the 1990s, and struggled further when MGA Entertainment introduced a line of Bratz dolls, whose sexualized characters contrasted with Barbie's older, chaste image. Mattel therefore attempted to overhaul the Barbie brand to keep the toy relevant to consumers in the modern age by bringing in consultants and conducting research on key market groups. Mattel consultants initially considered reducing the Barbie's breast size, but later claimed that the doll's figure could not be changed because "being consistent is one of her biggest strengths." This move might also have been rejected because of the success of the sexualized Bratz dolls of Mattel's competitors.  A toy may not seem like a big deal and certainly isn't an object we usually expect to save lives, but to a child, a favorite truck or doll can appear larger than life. A toy can spark play that reflects a child's hopes and dreams, or fears and uncertainties. The representation of that toy -- whether it reflects their skin color, gender expression, or body shape or size, whether it matches the child's sense of self -- can go a long way in making them feel like they fit in. The historic lack of diversity in Barbie dolls specifically when it comes to gender representation, was one of the first touchpoints in my life that made me feel like I was different, somehow manufactured wrong.
