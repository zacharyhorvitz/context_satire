 Years ago Jeff Friday attended the Sundance Film Festival, looked around and did not see black people represented. So he decided to do something about it. On Wednesday the annual American Black Film Festival begins in Miami. Now Hollywood looks very different, but it still grapples with some of the same issues of diversity as it did when the festival launched 20 years ago.  The U.S. ambassador to Qatar apologized to the government Thursday after a video featuring two U.S. soldiers laughing caused some to believe they were insulting the country. The video, posted to YouTube, shows the soldiers as they talk into a camera, standing in front of a pair of U.S. and Qatari flags. The soldier on the left laughs as he says in a slightly slurred voice that he's speaking from "an unknown disclosed location in a place called ..." -- then makes an indistinct sound to further indicate his location is secret. He gestures at the Qatari flag behind him in an exaggerated fashion, while the second soldier is laughing.  South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Tuesday that Donald Trump's criticism of a judge with Mexican heritage is an example of playing "the race card" and is "very un-American." "I don't think he's racist but he's playing the race card. And  in the political process he's putting the race card on the table," he told CNN Tuesday. "I think it's very un-American for a political leader to question whether a person can judge based on his heritage."
