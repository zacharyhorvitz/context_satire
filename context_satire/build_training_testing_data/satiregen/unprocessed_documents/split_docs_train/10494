The Kratt brothers find out that a scientist has discovered a new species of mantis in the Amazon Rainforest in Peru and named it Liturgusa krattorum, after them. They decide to creature adventure with this unique insect. Meanwhile, villains Zach Varmitech, Donita Donata, and Chef Gourmand are upset that the mantis was named after the Kratt brothers instead of after them, so they decide to capture all of the Liturgusa krattorum. The Wild Kratts must rescue the mantises and get them back to "living free and in the wild". When looking at the fauna of the region, there is a broader definition of the American Southwest. The Southwestern Center for Herpetological Research defines the Southwest as being only the states of Arizona, New Mexico, with parts of California, Nevada, Texas, and Utah; although they include all of those six states in their map of the region, solely for ease of defining the border. The Tillamook are an extinct group of Native American flatheads once indigenous to Crystal Lake who appear in the Friday the 13th comic books by Wildstorm. The first mentioning of the Tillamook is in the sixth and final issue of Wildstorm's Friday the 13th comic series, where they are the subject of an extended flashback sequence. The flashback reveals that in the 19th century the Tillamook were in the midst of being wiped out by a group of fur traders. The fur traders, knowing that the shaman of the Tillamook was responsible for giving his people the hope they needed to fight back, invade the tribe's main village to abduct him, killing anyone in their way.
