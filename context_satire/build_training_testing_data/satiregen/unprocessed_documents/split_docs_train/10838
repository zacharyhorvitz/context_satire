 The Supreme Court's forceful 6 to 3 opinion upholding a key provision of the Affordable Care Act is now in place. Obamacare is settled law. "Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. And in doing so, his court has handed down a decision that is a devastating blow to ideological opponents of universal health care and solidifies a fundamental new deal between Americans and our government.  Days before the Supreme Court could strip it of a central component, there is still no "plan B" for Obamacare. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell warned the Obama administration will be unable to cover the millions of Americans who could lose their medical insurance if the Supreme Court decides to unravel much of the Affordable Care Act. "We don't believe there is an administration solution that would undo all of that damage," Burwell said about the looming Supreme Court ruling in an exclusive interview with CNN. The court could rule as early as Monday in the health care case.  President Barack Obama strode into the Rose Garden on Thursday emboldened by a second Supreme Court victory for his signature health care law and more certain than ever in his legacy of health care expansion. "As the dust has settled, there can be no doubt that this law is working,"Obama declared at the White House, hours after justices read their opinions. "The Affordable Care Act is here to stay." The 6-3 decision delivered Thursday doesn't completely close the Affordable Care Act to challenges -- other legal battles related to the law are winding their way through the courts.
