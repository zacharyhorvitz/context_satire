In 2004, Hylton was the face of Dasani water, but was dropped when the product was withdrawn from the UK market due to bad publicity. On 5 March 2005, Hylton won Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up, the UK heat of the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, singing "Touch My Fire", co-written by her. The other contestants were the 1996 UK entrant Gina G, Andy Scott-Lee, the group Tricolore, and Katie Price. During the performance, tape used to hold her dress in place came loose, causing a 'wardrobe malfunction'. On 18 March 2004, UK authorities found a concentration of bromate, a suspected human carcinogen, in the product that could be considered harmful if consumed in large quantities. Coca-Cola immediately recalled half a million bottles and withdrew the "Dasani" brand from the UK market. Shortly after, plans to introduce the brand to Continental Europe were announced to have been cancelled as well. Bromate was not present in the water before Coca-Cola's treatment process. Prior to the launch, an article in The Grocer trade magazine had mentioned that the source of the Dasani brand water was treated tap water from Sidcup, a suburban area on the outskirts of London. By early March 2004, the mainstream press had picked up the storyâ€Š and it became widely reported that Sidcup tap water, after being processed by reverse osmosis, had been remineralized, bottled and sold under the Dasani brand name in the UK. Although Coca-Cola never implied that the water was being sourced from a spring or other natural sources, they marketed it as being especially "pure". This led the Food Standards Agency to request Hillingdon trading standards officers to launch an investigation into whether the claim was accurate.
