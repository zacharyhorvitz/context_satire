The St. John's water dog, also known as the St. John's dog or the lesser Newfoundland,  is an extinct landrace of domestic dog from Newfoundland. Little is known of the types that went into its genetic makeup, although it was probably a random-bred mix of old English, Irish and Portuguese working dogs. They were favorite dogs of fishermen because they have extraordinary qualities like good temperament and working behavior. The number of St. John's water dogs started declining by the beginning of the 20th century. The subsequent tour seemed to go well, and Penguin was the highest charting Fleetwood Mac album in the US at the time, clawing its way into the Top 50. However, during the recording of their next album, Mystery to Me, it was mutually agreed upon that Walker's vocal style and attitude "did not fit in" with Fleetwood Mac and by June 1973 he had left. If anything was ever recorded by Walker for Mystery to Me it was not used. The song tells the story of two young lovers who meet again at the beach resort where they had first met during the previous summer. They have arrived early this year, because they had not had enough time together the year before for their relationship to even progress to their first kiss -- she asks if they should do that now. They had met when chasing the girl's childhood pet, a Labrador Retriever, as he played along the water's edge; this inspired her to give her new love the nickname "Labrador." The three of them chase across the beach as they had that first day, and she calls her love into her arms and asks (for the third time) if they should have their first kiss.
