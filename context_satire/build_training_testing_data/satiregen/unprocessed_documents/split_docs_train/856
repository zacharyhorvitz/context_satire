The ending of the war saw the ending of the roadshow, the last performance being on Maui, Hawaii October 22, 1945, with Irving Berlin once again singing his "Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning." The Army Emergency Relief Fund collected millions of dollars, but the total amount was never accounted, nor released to the public. Grant had critics who complained about the high numbers of casualties that the Union Army suffered while he was in charge, but Lincoln would not replace Grant, because, in Lincoln's words: "I cannot spare this man. He fights."  His wounds as an Army Ranger in Afghanistan in 2009 left him in the fight of his life -- a fight for his life, for sheer survival. And when his story was told by the President of the United States, that story brought a packed house in the U.S. Capitol to its feet for a standing ovation. "Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit," President Barack Obama declared to the nation in his State of the Union address in January. Being singled out for presidential recognition made Remsburg overnight the most recognizable veteran in the country, a position he's not entirely comfortable with.
