The ongoing spat with Home Depot finally came to a head in July 1995, when Rickel was sued by Home Depot in a New Jersey state court. At the time of the dispute, Home Depot was looking to build a large store on a plot of land situated on Orange Street in Bloomfield, New Jersey near the Watsessing train station and Exit 148 of the Garden State Parkway. Rickel once again cried foul, and this time it was due to what they perceived to be a large encroachment on their territory. The year after Rickel shut its doors for good, in a strange twist, Home Depot decided to try its own hand at a smaller, neighborhood home center concept and created Villager's Hardware, which were similar to Rickel stores in their size and setup and included some scaled back versions of Home Depot departments like its plant nursery. The first location, coincidentally, opened in the former East Brunswick, New Jersey store Rickel occupied for thirty-plus years. Home Depot would open several more Villager's stores in the next year, but the company decided to discontinue the brand shortly thereafter. The Villager's stores remained open as smaller Home Depot locations and were all closed in 2008; Home Depot cited the bursting of the housing bubble as the reasoning. The Home Depot's lack of success in China has been attributed to the disconnect between The Home Depot's do-it-yourself ethos and Chinese culture. In 2012, the Home Depot conceded that it misread the country's appetite for do-it-yourself products. As a spokeswoman for the company said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, "The market trend says this is more of a do-it-for-me culture". Some have speculated that The Home Depot could have offered a do-it-for-me model to Chinese consumers.
