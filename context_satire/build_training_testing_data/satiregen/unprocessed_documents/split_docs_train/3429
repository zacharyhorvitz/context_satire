At a candlelight vigil for the girls, Loki notices a suspicious, hooded man who flees when Loki approaches him. Loki releases a police sketch of him. Later, the man sneaks into both families' houses but is not seen. After Loki sees Dover’s survivalist stash and learns he’s been lying about where he goes at night, Loki tails Dover, and almost discovers Alex. Alex is reunited with his parents. A recuperating Joy and Anna, with their families, thank a bandaged Loki. Later, Loki returns to the Jones' house where investigators are excavating the property. As he is about to leave, he hears the whistle. However, investigators at Taylor’s house find the blood to be from pigs, and conclude he was a fake with no involvement. Loki determines that Taylor stole the clothes from the girls' homes after the abduction, for his own abduction fantasy. Dover continues to scald Alex, who incoherently talks about escaping from a maze. Dover visits Alex's aunt Holly, who tells him that Alex's disability was from an accident when he was younger, with snakes that her husband kept as pets.
