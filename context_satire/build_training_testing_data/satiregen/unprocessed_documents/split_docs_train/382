In July 2000, BioWare announced that they were working with LucasArts to create a Star Wars role-playing video game for the PC and next-generation consoles. Joint BioWare CEO Greg Zeschuk commented that "The opportunity to create a richly detailed new chapter in the Star Wars universe is incredibly exciting for us. We are honored to be working with the extremely talented folks at Lucas Arts, developing a role-playing game based upon one of the most high-profile licenses in the world." The game was officially unveiled as Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic at E3 2001. A week prior to Mass Effect: Andromeda's official release, BioWare made the first ten hours of the game available to players as part of EA Access and Origin Access. The game's facial animations immediately became a topic of controversy, with players posting clips, images, and memes online that poked fun at its character movements. One group of players took their complaints a step further, incorrectly identifying an EA employee as a lead developer and verbally abusing her on Twitter. In response to the incident, BioWare released an official statement, saying, "We respect the opinions of our players and community ... Voice production started six months before the game's beta release. The voice production team were given the script 90% complete to work with. "There were a few changes made during recording, but most of the remaining 10 percent will be dealt with in our pickup session," O'Farrell said, "The pickup session is right at the end of the project, where we catch performance issues, tutorial lines, verbal hints, and anything else that we might have overlooked." A game the size of Knights of the Old Republic would typically take seven weeks to record; two weeks of recording all-day and all-night meant LucasArts was able to record all voices in five weeks.
