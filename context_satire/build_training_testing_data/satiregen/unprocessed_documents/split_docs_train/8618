 The big test for the stock market's Trump rally may be President Trump himself. Wall Street's post-election surge was built on hopes of a "pro-growth" agenda getting swiftly implemented. Investors bet big that Trump's promises to slash taxes, unleash infrastructure spending and cut regulation would accelerate the sluggish American economy. But those hopes are already getting undercut by Trump's turbulent first days in office.  Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg is sharply criticizing President Trump on abortion policy. Trump on Monday reinstated a restriction known as the global gag rule that blocks nongovernmental organizations around the world from receiving American foreign aid if they perform abortions or discuss them in family planning. Reproductive care providers said the restriction could have catastrophic implications for women around the world. Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, made clear in a Facebook post Thursday that she shares that view. In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that Trump declared a loss of $916Â million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years. During the second presidential debate, Trump acknowledged using the deduction, but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied.
