In Islam,  Muhammad used kohl and recommended others to use it because he believed that it was beneficial for the eyes based on the following saying by him: "One of the best kinds of kohl that you use is Ithmid (antimony); it brightens the vision and makes the hair (eye-lashes) grow" and he "used to apply kohl to his right eye three times, and to his left eye twice." It is used by many Muslim men today during Ramadan as a sign of devotion although the practice is not universally agreed upon as being based on authentic sources.
