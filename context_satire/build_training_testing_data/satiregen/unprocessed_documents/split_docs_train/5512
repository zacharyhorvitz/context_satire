In August 2014, Lithgow revealed in an interview that the film had been dismantled and "completely reimagined" and that he was expected to rerecord his role in the next month, while mentioning that McDormand was still part of the film. In November 2014, it was reported that new elements had been added to the story, such as treating nature as the film's antagonist. Pixar's general manager and president Jim Morris stated, "We all liked the movie from the beginning, but… the story had some kind of fatal flaws in it that none of us really saw. It was kind of a Billy Elliot story. The filmmakers wanted to explore what dinosaurs represent today, and how they are represented in stereotypes. Peterson stated: "It's time to do a movie where you get to know the dinosaur, what it's really like to be a dinosaur and to be with a dinosaur." Peterson said the inspiration for the project came from a childhood visit to the 1964 New York World's Fair where he was impressed by some dinosaur Audio-Animatronics. Arlo was designed so that the audience could identify with him and be able to see the "boy" inside the dinosaur. Sohn explained "When Arlo gets lost in the wilderness, you need to worry that he's out of his element and in danger of getting killed, rather than just thinking 'You're an animal. Why don’t you just turn around and eat some leaves?'" He additionally stated "If you put like a realistic dinosaur in the woods, eat some leaves, you’re fine… But we really wanted to play with that twist of this is a boy out there.
