 Mitt Romney waited until the presidential debates in the final five weeks of the election campaign to make his long-anticipated shift to the political center after previously espousing strongly conservative stances to win the Republican nomination. The move appeared to catch President Barack Obama by surprise at their first face-to-face match up. His lackluster performance against a strong showing by Romney helped the former Massachusetts governor to catch, and in some places, pass the president in the polls. Obama then fought back.  Three debates down. Two weeks of campaigning to go. President Barack Obama put Republican challenger Mitt Romney on the defensive on foreign policy in the final presidential debate Monday night, with analysts and an immediate poll giving Obama the victory. With 15 days before the November 6 vote, the candidates now hit the road for the final sprint to Election Day -- focusing on the handful of vital battleground states that could decade the closely contested race.  The third and final presidential debate proved to be a substantive, if not sharp, discussion on the major issues facing the nation as both candidates tried in earnest to persuade the small sliver of undecideds to vote for them. While foreign policy was the overarching theme, it was no surprise that the domestic economy shared center stage as President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney each sought to score points on the No. 1 issue of this election. In two weeks, the long and bitter campaign will come to a close -- barring an election controversy  -- and Monday night's debate will help frame the discussion in the closing days.
