In 2008, fellow Slipknot band member Sid Wilson introduced Shawn Crahan to Michael Pfaff, and along with a few other musicians, they had a jam session together. Crahan himself said that during the session he could only focus on Pfaff and how they both played together, explaining that "it was the way he was throwing his shapes, to my shapes." Shortly after meeting with Pfaff, Crahan introduced guitarist Ty Fury to the project. Crahan had previously worked with Fury on a band he was a part of in Denver, but recruited him for Dirty Little Rabbits. When Lisa, Apu, and the McCartneys gather on the Kwik-E-Mart roof, Apu tells Lisa, "I learned long ago to tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them.

In addition to her installations, Pfaff creates paintings, sculpture and prints. "I've always done prints and drawings," Pfaff says. "If you get an installation of mine, you inherit  Ryan, myself, a crew, the dog, the noise, the dirt. We wreck the house.
