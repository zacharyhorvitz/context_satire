 With the Wisconsin primary less than a week away, Tuesday night's GOP town hall was by no means a pro forma event; it was one of the last real opportunities for the remaining three candidates to adapt their campaign narratives before the delegate math is set. Only two candidates -- Donald Trump and Ted Cruz -- have a mathematical shot at the nomination, and the CNN forum gave voters a chance to size them up while they are locked in an all-out campaign dogfight. If you are a small-government, constitutional conservative, the Ted Cruz you wanted to see showed up. His strengths -- his intellectual firepower, policy depth and unshakable poise -- were on full display.  This time, it's personal. Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will air their increasingly acrimonious differences in a town hall Tuesday night in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, airing on CNN and moderated by Anderson Cooper. Ohio Gov. John Kasich will also participate, rounding out the Republican presidential field.  Republican forces determined to thwart Donald Trump from marching to the presidential nomination are digging their heels into the soil of Wisconsin and planning a relentless attack against the GOP front-runner up to the April 5 primary. Candidates moved almost immediately past Tuesday evening's results in Arizona and Utah and retrained their eyes on the Badger State, where both Ted Cruz and John Kasich visited Wednesday. And super PACs are on the cusp of launching aggressive negative television campaigns aimed at Trump in a state where his poll numbers are believed to be considerably weaker than they are nationally. The question is: Who can take advantage of any anti-Trump movement?
