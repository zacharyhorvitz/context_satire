About her character Rebecca, Allen has said: "She definitely starts the series with a cross to bear.. you know, really angry and kind of 'guard up', but I think she makes a real effort to try to be good. She does make an effort to be good, and she wants to be, and she fails constantly, but I think that even  attempts in changing Bernie, the little boy, to a vampire... done with good intentions...she really wanted to care for someone." In 2017, Hall joined the cast of A Rainy Day in New York, re-teaming her with Woody Allen. In January 2018, Hall donated her salary to Times Up after re-reading sexual assault allegation stating: “I see, not only how complicated this matter is, but that my actions have made another woman feel silenced and dismissed, I regret this decision and wouldn’t make the same one today.” Allen told Loveline that the audience was "brought to tears at the sight of a troubled young girl doing something good". At that point Allen said she knew that music was something she needed to do either as a lifelong vocation or to get it out of her system. She played the piano to grade 5 standard and achieved grade 8 in singing. Allen also played violin, guitar and trumpet and was a member of a chamber choir.
