The headline segments, shown during every nonâ€“hard news hour throughout the day, were usually two-to-three-minute recaps of the news of the day, unique to Fox News Channel with an added timestamp on the intro graphic. As of July 2011, the channel is carried on Sky Italia (a fellow News Corporation company at the time), its first European carriage deal. Fox Business HD was first broadcast in Israel by cable provider Hot in 2015, and it is also carried by Cellcom TV and Partner TV. Fox News Channel acts as the de facto news division of the Fox broadcast network, providing coverage of major breaking news and select live events, such as the State of the Union speech. The network also manages Fox NewsEdge, a distribution service of footage and reports for local Fox affiliates' news broadcasts.
