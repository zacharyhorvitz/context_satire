 Hillary Clinton, looking to stem a string of late-in-the-calendar wins by rival Bernie Sanders, is investing heavily in Kentucky ahead of its Tuesday primary. The former secretary of state's campaign has launched both television and radio ads in the state's major markets and dispatched more than a dozen surrogates to turn out voters in the days before the primary. Clinton has also personally invested time: She will have headlined 11 campaign stops over three trips in the last two weeks by the time Kentucky Democrats go to the polls. What to watch in Kentucky, Oregon "It is a great honor to be here with you and I hope to earn your support in the primary on Tuesday," Clinton said at St. Stephens Baptist Church in Southwest Louisville on Sunday.  Hillary Clinton didn't rule out Wednesday picking her Democratic presidential primary challenger, Bernie Sanders, from serving as her vice president. "I won't get into that," she told CNN's Chris Cuomo in an exclusive interview, when asked if giving Sanders a spot on the ticket would help bring the party together. She also declined to answer if Sanders was in consideration for the No. 2 slot.  Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress, said that the Democratic primary ends in June, adding her voice to the growing calls in the party to unite behind one candidate ahead of the July convention. In an interview with CNN, Mikulski was careful not to call on Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is trailing front-runner Hillary Clinton, to quit. "I'm not one of those people (to say), 'Tell Bernie to get out,' " she said. But she made clear that after the final votes are counted in June, the primary is "over," breaking with Sanders, who has vowed to take his fight to the July convention in Philadelphia.
