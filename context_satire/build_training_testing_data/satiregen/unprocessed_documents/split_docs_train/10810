 The chairman of the Republican Party, the Republican House speaker and the top Senate Republican on Tuesday condemned GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump's call to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. House Speaker Paul Ryan said at a press conference that Trump's comments are "not who we are as a party" and violate the Constitution. "This is not conservatism," the Wisconsin representative said, adding, "Some of our best and biggest allies in this struggle and fight against radical Islam terror are Muslims." Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said such a ban would be "completely inconsistent with American values."  The Republican leaders of the three most important states in the primary contest are all condemning Donald Trump's plans to forbid Muslims from coming to the United States. In a series of tweets and statements on Monday evening, the New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina Republican Party chairmen said they disagreed with Trump's stunning call for the U.S. to ban Muslim visitors or immigrants. The chairmen -- who represent the first three states to vote in the GOP presidential primary -- don't officially endorse candidates, but their thoughts behind the scenes can send messages to activists who look to them for guidance. Matt Moore, the Republican chair in South Carolina, was the most outspoken against Trump's plan, which was criticized by most of his Republican rivals.  Donald Trump is facing backlash after his suggestion that the United States ban all Muslims from entering the country. Trump's remarks come after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, carried out by suspected ISIS sympathizers. This is not the first time Trump has made news on the subject. From saying he would let a Muslim serve in his Cabinet to talking about the world's "Muslim problem," here's a roundup of the noteworthy things Donald Trump has said about Muslims.
