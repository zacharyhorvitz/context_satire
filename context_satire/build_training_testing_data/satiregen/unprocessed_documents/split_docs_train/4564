In 1999 and 2000, the Travel Channel was looking for a travel host, and Brown was chosen after a series of auditions. In her role of host, she introduces viewers to vacation destinations and hotels in the United States and around the world, as well as showcasing restaurants and activities at those destinations. As a travel host, Brown travels 230 days out of the year and takes eight days to film an hour-long episode. On October 30, 2006, CTV Travel was renamed Travel + Escape (stylized as travel + escape until October 5, 2011) to give the channel, described by its owner, a new "edgier" look and feel to fit its new shift in programming the channel had already been making towards more character-driven and experienced-based travel series rather than the typical travelogue programs. New programs introduced to the channel included such series as Dead Famous, The Pleasure Zone, Hunt for Supertwister, The Amazing Race, and Mayhem at the Manor. On October 1, 2018, Travel Channel revealed a new logo stylized as Trvl Channel, and shifted its programming to focus on "the paranormal, the unsolved, the creepy and terrifying", akin to its counterpart Destination America when they drifted to paranormal programming themselves full-time in mid-2017. It is unknown if Travel Channel's other popular programming such as Bizarre Foods, its spinoff series Bizarre Foods Delicious Destinations, Man v. Food, Food Paradise and Xtreme Waterparks would continue to air on the network or move to networks within Discovery's portfolio.
