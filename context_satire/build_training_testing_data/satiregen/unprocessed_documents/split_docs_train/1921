At a very young age, Fletcher began writing music commercially. He originally auditioned for Busted, but lost out on the place to Charlie Simpson after the record label Island decided the band should be a trio rather than a four-piece; Fletcher states that he was in the band "for approximately 24 hours." This led to a job with the band's songwriting team, mainly because of the label's intrigue at his writing talents,  Fletcher then got to know Busted band member James Bourne, which would then lead to a strong song writing relationship between the two. He has since stated that it was Bourne who taught him how to "properly" structure songs, and how to "come up with good, poppy melodies". After the tour, the band revealed that they had scrapped two albums worth of songs recorded since Above the Noise. Fletcher said: "After a certain amount of time, you feel like that was where you were at, at a momentIf we released stuff we recorded three years ago, we wouldn't be 100 per cent behind it any more. We still love the songs but we'd be excited about doing new things." The following day, they announced that they would finally begin recording new material in January 2017. On 25 April 2016, the band announced that they would be going back on tour in June 2016, where they would be playing all five albums and including some original new songs for a potential new album over three dates in each of four chosen cities: Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester and London, with the tour called "The Anthology". Talking to 1883 Magazine, Fletcher said: "After doing two massive Arena tours with McBusted, we really wanted to do something different for this tour to herald the return of McFly. So we're playing some iconic rock venues that will allow our fans to experience the songs in a much more up close and personal environment." Jones added: "We're going to play every song from every album over three nights in each city, plus some surprises.
