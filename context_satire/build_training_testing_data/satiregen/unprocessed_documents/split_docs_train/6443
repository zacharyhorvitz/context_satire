The school is conventionally named after Cadwallader C. Washburn. When the school was presented to the school board it was called "William D. Washburn High School", in reference to the brother of Cadwallader C. Washburn, however naming the school after William D. Washburn is thought to be an error. The school has been heavily influenced by Minneapolis' milling empire. The school's newspaper, The Grist, involves milling terminology,  the school's colors, blue and orange, were those of Gold Medal Flour, a company partly run by the Washburn family and a predecessor to General Mills and the athletic teams' nickname are the "Millers". Garnett's performance received very positive reviews from critics. The Safdie brothers arrived at Garnett after a series of rewrites based on player availability. Their choices before Garnett included Amar'e Stoudemire (denied to cut his hair to the time period), Kobe Bryant (his representation said he wanted to direct, not act, though Bryant denied any knowledge of the project) and Joel Embiid (his schedule made it impossible to film) Garnett was one of the first retired athletes they approached. Garnett later said the process of filming "felt special, but you didnâ€™t know it." Tramell is interrogated by Scotland Yard Detective Supt. Roy Washburn, who notes that D-Tubocurarine, a neuromuscular blocking agent used to relax muscles during general anaesthesia, was found in her car and in her companion's body, and the companion was not breathing at the time of the crash, and that a man named "Dicky Pep" said that he sold Tramell "15 milliliters of DTC last Thursday". Tramell counters by saying that this Dicky Pep must be lying because "you've got him on some other charge and he's trying to deal his way out, if he even exists".
