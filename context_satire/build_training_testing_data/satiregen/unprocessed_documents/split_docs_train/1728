ISIS is in the house." The Hollywood Reporter said critics had "an overall positive view", some calling it "Tarantino's love letter to '60s L.A.'", praising its cast and setting, while others were "divided on its ending."

RogerEbert.com's Brian Tallerico gave it four out of four stars, calling it "layered and ambitious, the product of a confident filmmaker working with collaborators completely in tune with his vision".
