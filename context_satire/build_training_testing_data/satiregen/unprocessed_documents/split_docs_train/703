 Longshot presidential candidate Carly Fiorina has won an invitation to the powerful Koch Brothers' donor summit this weekend, an opportunity for her to impress some of the Republican Party's most well-heeled contributors. Fiorina, with little money and little support in early polls, will appear at the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce's semi-annual event this weekend, the organization confirmed. The line-up in California was first reported by USA Today. Joining Fiorina will be Wisconsin Gov.  Donald Trump does everything on a grand scale. On the campaign trail, the Republican presidential candidate gives longer speeches than his opponents. He spends money lavishly and likes to brag about it. And he attacks fellow Republicans more harshly, as he did over the weekend when he upended the GOP primary race by questioning John McCain's war hero status.  Jeb Bush said Monday he "regularly" asks God for forgiveness, two days after his Republican presidential rival Donald Trump told an audience of conservative Christians that he doesn't do the same. "Look I'm as imperfect under God's watchful eye as the next person," the former Florida governor told conservative radio host Michael Medved. "And if you start with that premise, then you're seeking his forgiveness to be better, to be more committed to taking care of people, to be more committed to being a loving husband, a good father." "My relationship with my savior is one where I do seek forgiveness," he said.
