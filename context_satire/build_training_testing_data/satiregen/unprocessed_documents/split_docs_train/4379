He served as national president of Sigma Chi in his later years and as a member of Purdue's board of trustees from 1909 to 1916. Ade was also a member of the Purdue Alumni Association. Ade donated funds for construction of Purdue's Memorial Gymnasium and its Memorial Union Building. In 1940, the then owners of the University Bookstore, Doc Epple and Red Sammons hired local artist Art Evans to draw a boilermaker to use as an advertising icon for the bookstore. A modernized version is still used in that capacity at University Bookstore. In 1944, the editors of the university's Debris yearbook sought, and obtained, permission from University Bookstore to use Purdue Pete on the cover of the 1944 edition of the Debris yearbook. When asked the name of the boilermaker depicted in the advertising drawing, Epple coined the name "Pete".
