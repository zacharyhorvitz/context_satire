 Marilee Walmer is no fan of Mitt Romney's. An administrative assistant from Taylors, South Carolina, Walmer is backing Rick Santorum in the Republican presidential race. As she tells it, Romney "doesn't have a backbone." But like other conservative Republicans here, she is bracing for the prospect of a Romney victory in the South Carolina primary on Saturday.  Republican candidate Jon Huntsman will drop out of the presidential race on Monday and endorse front-runner Mitt Romney, a senior official with the former Utah governor's campaign told CNN. Huntsman finished third in last week's New Hampshire primary, a state in which he had staked his entire campaign, behind Romney and Texas Rep. Ron Paul. "Governor Huntsman did not want to stand in the way of the candidate best prepared to beat Barack Obama and turn our economy around. That's Mitt Romney," the official said.  Briefly back in Congress doing his day job, Ron Paul met with high school students outside his office. True to form, he signed copies of the Constitution and wryly told them with a chuckle, "No one around here reads it very much. I'd like to get everybody to read it." Paul made a detour from the presidential campaign trail to Capitol Hill on Wednesday in order to cast a vote to protest raising the debt limit.
