 Apple reported a record quarter on Wednesday, boosted by strong iPhone and iPad sales, but the popularity of cheaper versions of its mobile devices pinched the company's profits. The company sold 47.8 million iPhones during the past quarter, shattering the record of 37 million that it set a year ago when the iPhone 4S debuted. It's a stunning number, considering that supply chain woes limited iPhone 5 availability throughout much of the quarter. That helped Apple record a quarterly profit of $13.1 billion, the second highest profit ever earned by a U.S. corporation -- bested only by Exxon Mobil's record-setting $14.8 billion quarter from the fall of 2008, when oil prices were at an all-time high.  In an age of streaming media, we're still a culture of digital hoarders. That may partly explain why on Tuesday, Apple introduced an iPad with 128 gigabytes of storage capacity, twice as much as any previous model. But will the average tablet owner need that much space? For casual users, tablets are media-consumption devices.  Apple added a new member to its iPad line on Tuesday, offering a 9.7-inch Retina iPad with 128 gigabytes of storage -- doubling the tablet's previous max capacity. Everything else about Apple's tablet is the same, including the dual-core A6X processor, 2 gigabtyes of RAM, and 10 hours of battery life. To account for the added storage space, the 128 GB Wi-Fi model will now cost $799, while the LTE model will cost $929. To offer some differentiation from its other iPads -- which start at $329 for the iPad mini -- Apple is targeting the new model primarily at professional users, including those in the architectural and medical fields who handle large files.
