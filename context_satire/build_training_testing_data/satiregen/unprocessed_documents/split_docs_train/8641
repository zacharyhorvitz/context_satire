Jeff Jobe is less than 24 hours away from the most high-profile moment of his career. The publisher of six weekly community newspapers in South Central Kentucky, Jobe learned Tuesday that he had been invited by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to ask a question at the next day's press briefing -- via Skype.
