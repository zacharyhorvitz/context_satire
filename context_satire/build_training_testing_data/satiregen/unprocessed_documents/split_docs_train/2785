Lola and the angels arrive at the factory, and she is immediately unsatisfied with Charlie's first design of the boot. Quickly getting the women of the factory on her side, she draws a quick design of a boot, explaining the most important factor is by far the heel ("The Sex is in the Heel"). George, the factory manager, realizes a way to make her design practical, and an impressed Charlie begs Lola to stay until a prestigious footwear show in Milan in three weeks' time, to design a new line of "kinky boots" that could save the factory. Lola is reluctant, since she is already receiving crass comments from Don, the factory foreman and some of the other factory workers but is flattered by Charlie's praise, and finally agrees. Charlie announces that the factory will be moving ahead with production on the boots. He thanks Lauren for giving him the idea and offers her a promotion. She accepts and is horrified but thrilled to realize she is falling for him ("The History of Wrong Guys"). The challenge is all about turning the tuxedo on its head; inspired by Christian Siriano's Oscar look for actor Billy Porter, the designers must find a way to take the tuxedo into the future with a mix of male, female, and non-binary models.
