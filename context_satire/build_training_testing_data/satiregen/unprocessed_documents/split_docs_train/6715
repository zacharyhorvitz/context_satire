  Scotland will remain part of the United Kingdom -- along with England, Wales and Northern Ireland -- following a historic referendum vote. A majority of voters rejected the possibility of Scotland breaking away and becoming an independent nation. With 31 of 32 councils declared, the "No" campaign has won the referendum on Scottish independence. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond admitted defeat in Scotland's independence referendum Friday -- and urged the rest of Scotland to do the same.  The three main UK party leaders gave a joint promise Tuesday that Scotland will get extra powers if it opts to stay part of the United Kingdom in a landmark vote in two days' time. Opinion polls have put the pro-independence and pro-union camps neck-and-neck in the run-up to Thursday's referendum. With the survival of the 300-year-old union of England, Scotland and Wales as Great Britain on a knife-edge, UK Prime Minister David Cameron of the Conservatives, coalition partner Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats and Labour leader Ed Miliband have joined forces to beg Scotland to stay. In a pledge published on the front page of Scotland's Daily Record newspaper, the three leaders say that if Scotland's voters reject independence, work to devolve "extensive new powers" from the central government in Westminster will start Friday.  President Obama weighed in on the Scottish independence referendum Wednesday night when he tweeted in favor of a united UK. But for the most part, faced with the prospective divorce of its closest friend, the United States is following the advice column carefully: don't take sides, keep your opinions to yourself, and avoid getting dragged into the fray. The complicating factor in this potential split? One side has a nuclear arsenal.
