 Michelle Obama is saying goodbye to the White House. The first lady put up a series of sentimental social media posts before the new first family assumes the role on Friday. On Wednesday evening, Obama posted an image showing her embracing President Barack Obama. "Being your First Lady has been the honor of a lifetime.  President Barack Obama plans to travel to Palm Springs after the inauguration Friday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday. "The first family is looking forward to flying to Palm Springs, California, on Friday," Earnest said, noting the desert city fits the bill of a warm destination, which Obama has long promised. "He and his family have enjoyed the time they spent there in the past, and they're looking forward to traveling there on Friday," Earnest added. Obama will fly aboard the presidential aircraft to the Coachella Valley oasis, where he's taken frequent golf trips as president, two sources familiar with his plans told CNN earlier Tuesday.  Not only have the White House website and Twitter accounts swapped out former President Barack Obama for President Donald Trump, but cabinet departments no longer make any reference to the previous administration. The Department of Defense's website features its caretaker leader, Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work, as its highest official. That's likely to change soon, upon the expected Friday confirmation of Trump's defense secretary nominee, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis. Similarly the Department of Labor lists as its acting top leader as Edward Hugler, a career department employee.
