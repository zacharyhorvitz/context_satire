Cally and Avon quite often went on missions together and shared a knack for delivering quick-witted replies to each other's statements, which would somewhat indicate a growing affection for each other. However, Avon quite openly disdained her compassionate nature and her idealism, which he found to be only somewhat more tolerable than Blake's. Similarly, Cally at times openly mocked Avon's "cold" nature and often clashed with his more self-serving instincts. At one point during the episode "Horizon", Cally and Avon are the only two humans left on board the Liberator, and Cally pointedly rejects Avon's idea of leaving together whilst leaving the others to their fate. Slave is the flight computer on the Scorpio. It is featured throughout the fourth season voiced by Peter Tuddenham. It was originally programmed to respond only to Dorian's voice print, but Orac was later able to remove this so the computer responded to anyone who addressed it. The crew made general use of Slave's abilities throughout their time aboard the ship. Servalan was played by Jacqueline Pearce (in the B7 audio series, she is played by Daniela Nardini). She was the principal villain of the series. Her creator Terry Nation originally intended her to make a single appearance but she finally appeared in all four series, the only guest character to do so. She is principally concerned with organising efforts to destroy Blake and crush resistance to the Federation's rule.
