 Listening to last night's two Republican presidential candidate debates, you might have come away with the impression that if a Republican wins the White House, U.S. foreign policy is going to be radically different. The GOP will lead in juxtaposition to President Barack Obama's abdication, risk ready in contrast to his risk aversion. America -- now no longer feared, respected, and admired -- will once again stand tall. Having worked as a foreign policy adviser to both Republican and Democratic administrations (and having voted for both, too) I'd suggest laying down until those dizzy feelings of enthusiasm and hope for a radically altered foreign policy for 2017 start to pass. The platform of the Republican Party of the United States is generally based on American conservatism, in contrast to the modern liberalism of the Democrats. The party incorporates moderates, sometimes described as establishment Republicans, and members of the Tea Party or Freedom Caucus, who have been described as populist, right-wing, and far-right.The positions of the Republican Party have evolved over time. Contemporarily, the party's economic conservatism involves support for lower taxes, free market capitalism, deregulation of corporations, and restrictions on labor unions. The party is also socially conservative, and supports restrictions on immigration, gun rights, restrictions on abortion, and other traditional values, usually with a Christian foundation.  The stakes are high at Wednesday night's CNN Republican debate, as Republican front-runner Donald Trump takes center stage. Twitter users are sending CNN Politics questions they want to hear the field address. Some have directed their questions to a specific candidate.
