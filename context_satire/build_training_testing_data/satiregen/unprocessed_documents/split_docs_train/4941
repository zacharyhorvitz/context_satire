On the other hand, when the speaker and the president belong to opposite parties, the public role and influence of the speaker tend to increase. As the highest-ranking member of the opposition party (and de facto leader of the opposition), the speaker is normally the chief public opponent of the president's agenda. In this scenario, the speaker is known for undercutting the president's agenda by blocking measures by the minority party or rejecting bills by the Senate. One famous instance came in the form of Thomas Brackett Reed (under Grover Cleveland), a speaker notorious for his successful attempt to force the Democrats to vote on measures where the Republicans had clear majorities, which ensured that Cleveland's Democrats were in no position to challenge the Republicans in the House. The Constitution does not spell out the political role of the speaker. As the office has developed historically, however, it has taken on a clearly partisan cast, very different from the speakership of most Westminster-style legislatures, such as the speaker of the British House of Commons, which is meant to be scrupulously non-partisan. The speaker in the United States, by tradition, is the head of the majority party in the House of Representatives, outranking the majority leader. However, despite having the right to vote, the speaker usually does not participate in debate.  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy confirmed Thursday the House will vote on a Democratic bill to dismantle US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, more commonly known as ICE. It's a move Democrats are already calling a "political stunt" since Republicans, who hold the majority, broadly oppose the bill and it would not pass. House Speaker Paul Ryan fiercely criticized the effort to abolish ICE earlier Thursday in a news conference. "They have really jumped the sharks on the left," Ryan said.
