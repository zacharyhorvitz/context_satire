 As the Duke and Duchess of Sussex walked out of St. George's Chapel a married couple on Saturday afternoon, it marked a historic moment in the history of the British monarchy. The fairytale of a biracial woman marrying into the British royal family has got many in Britain caught up in the fantasy that a page has been turned, opening up a new chapter in the relationship between Britain and its black population. However, once the delirium will have worn off, we will all wake up to the reality that is the nightmare of British racism. The royal family is perhaps the most identifiable symbol of whiteness in the world. The Queen addressed both houses of parliament in Westminster Hall on 20 March 2012. Also in March, the Royal Commonwealth Society launched the Jubilee Time Capsule to mark the jubilee. The British Broadcasting Corporation and Andrew Marr created the television documentary The Diamond Queen, in which various members of the Royal Family and current and former politicians spoke about the Sovereign and her life. The documentary was criticised by the campaign group Republic, which argued that it breached BBC guidelines on impartiality. The Royal Households of the United Kingdom consists of royal officials and the supporting staff of the British Royal Family, as well as the Royal Household which supports the Sovereign. Each member of the Royal Family who undertakes public duties has their own separate household. When Elizabeth II succeeded her father George VI as sovereign of the United Kingdom, she appointed a new household.
