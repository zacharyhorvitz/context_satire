In Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself, Alda describes how as a teen he was raised as a Roman Catholic and eventually he realized he had begun thinking like an agnostic or atheist. While he admits to still praying on occasion, he said he wants to find meaning in this life rather than worrying about the next one. While he still talks to God on occasion, he admits it often comes at times of fear rather than out of a sense of belief. Furthermore, he does not like to be labeled as an "agnostic," stating it is too fancy a word for him in an interview for the 2008 question section of the Edge Foundation website. The Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award is presented by the Screen Actors Guild's National Honors and Tributes Committee for "outstanding achievement in fostering the finest ideals of the acting profession."

Since then, it has been presented every year except 1963 and 1981.
