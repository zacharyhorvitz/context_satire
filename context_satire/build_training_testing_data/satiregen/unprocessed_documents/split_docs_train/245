 The President of the United States is enmeshed in scandal this week. So is Kevin Spacey. It feels a characteristic irony of 2017 that even as a real-life President fights allegations that could remove him from office, our most notorious fictional President is removed from the air. Netflix announced on Wednesday that "House of Cards," in which Kevin Spacey plays the corrupt President Underwood, will not be renewed for further seasons.  Actor Kevin Spacey is seeking unspecified treatment following an accusation of sexual assault by an actor, who says he was a minor at the time, and amid new reported allegations by a British man. American actor Anthony Rapp told BuzzFeed in an interview Sunday that Spacey made a sexual advance toward him at a party in 1986, when Rapp was 14 and Spacey was 26. And on Wednesday, UK daily The Sun published a new account of alleged sexual misconduct against Spacey, made by British national Daniel Beal. He said that in 2010, Spacey had followed him outside a hotel bar in southern England where Beal was working and uninvitedly revealed his genitals to him.  Actors are usually hailed for coming out but Kevin Spacey is being criticized. That's because many are taking exception with the "House of Cards" star revealing his sexuality as part of an apology in the wake of an accusation of sexual misconduct. On Sunday, Buzzfeed published a story in which "Star Trek: Discovery" actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of making a sexual advance towards him in 1986 when Rapp was a 14-year-old child actor and Spacey was 26.
