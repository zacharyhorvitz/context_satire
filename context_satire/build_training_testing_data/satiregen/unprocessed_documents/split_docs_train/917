The Nazgûl wore their rings for so long that their physical forms faded away: they became entirely invisible to mortal eyes. Their black robes gave them visible form. While wearing the One Ring during their assault on Weathertop, Frodo saw them as pale figures robed in white, with "haggard hands" and wearing crowns. The Witch-king specifically was taller than the others, with "long and gleaming" hair. As Leo and Holly ascend the Mountain they are intercepted by the people of Hes, who are then joined by a ghost-like Messenger, who leads them up the mountain. After they arrive at the vast temple-palace complex near the summit, they are taken into the presence of the veiled Hesea, who admits that she is the Messenger who guided them up the Mountain. Light and dark female rivals, Helen and Queen Meriamun, both cause men's deaths; Odysseus is "beguiled" by the snake of Meriamun, as was Eve, and the Argive Helen dwells with death, yet she is “beauty's self.” These characters represent abstractions, rather than individuals. The hero is the ideal to which the reader is meant to aspire, but Haggard and Lane fuse together in their depiction of the fierce Meriamun. Meriamun is an embodiment of the independent New Woman they strongly disliked, however they cannot help their attachment to the character.
