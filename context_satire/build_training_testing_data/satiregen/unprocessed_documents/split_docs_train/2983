 As they struggle to save for retirement, a growing number of middle-class Americans plan to postpone their golden years until they are in their 80's. Nearly one-third, or 30%, now plan to work until they are 80 or older -- up from 25% a year ago, according to a Wells Fargo survey of 1,000 adults with income less than $100,000. "It is so tough for Americans to save for retirement that the answer seems to be to work longer," said Joe Ready, director of Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust.

The candidates were in their Sunday best attire and behavior last night at the Alfred E. Smith Charity Dinner.

Just a few days ago, there was little to joke about when the candidates went face to face over integral issues at the second presidential debate.
