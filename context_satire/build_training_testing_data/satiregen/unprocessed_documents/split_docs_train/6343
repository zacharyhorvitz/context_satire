 George Zimmerman never denied shooting Trayvon Martin, but he said he did so in self defense. Late Saturday night, a Florida jury found him not guilty in the teenager's death. The verdict caps a case that has inflamed passions for well over a year, much of it focused on race. The six jurors -- all of them women -- deliberated for 16Â½ hours.  When the verdict came, it was as dramatic as anyone could have imagined. A late Saturday night, a courtroom of breathless people, the accused man standing, and finally the words: "We, the jury, find George Zimmerman not guilty." Zimmerman blinked and shook hands with his legal team. His mother smiled.  They took to the streets, to radio call-in shows, to social media to vent their frustration. George Zimmerman not guilty? It can't be, they said. "Only white life is protected in America," one protester in Washington shouted Sunday, a day after a Florida jury found the Hispanic former neighborhood watch volunteer not guilty in the 2012 death of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin.
