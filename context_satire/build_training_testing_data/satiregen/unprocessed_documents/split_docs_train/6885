Tanner was worth about $25,000 (although other sources claim he had as much as $100,000) at the time of his death, or so his mother claimed, however he left no will and an application for letter of administration was made on her behalf on August 14. The following day in Surrogate's Court, his brother applied to become temporary administrator of Tanner Smith's estate until his widow could appear in court. His brother claimed that Smith's widow had previously left him to marry another man and was living in South Brooklyn under the name Mary O'Brien McGuire. Of the $25,000, about $15,000 had been deposited in Liberty Bonds and used as bail for Link Mitchell, then accused of robbery. In the Wet Side Story universe, characters begin disappearing out of thin air. One of the characters, Butchy, realizes that all of this started after Tanner and Lela left. Butchy notices the necklace washed up, and leads the gang into the ocean to get the two back. They enter the real world and inform the others about the disappearing characters. The tour comes to a stop in Montreal. Van Dorp states the only reason he agreed to be interviewed for this documentary was to stake his claim over the footage from the tour which makes up the bulk of the film. Ginsberg encourages the viewer to follow the example of the performers they've witnessed and go on their own journeys of self-discovery. Bob Dylan continues to tour after the Rolling Thunder Revue, playing over 3,000 shows over the course of 40 years.
