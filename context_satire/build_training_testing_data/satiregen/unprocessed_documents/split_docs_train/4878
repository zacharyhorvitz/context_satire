The series is set after Steven Universe: The Movie, which itself takes place two years after Steven Universe finale "Change Your Mind". In "Change Your Mind", teenage protagonist Steven persuaded the Diamonds, the rulers of the intergalactic Gem empire, to cease their abusive, imperialist ways, and to heal the monstrous corrupted Gems that had been menacing the planet Earth. Now, Steven and his friends and family, the Crystal Gems, have constructed Little Homeworld, a community on Earth where humans and Gems can live in harmony. Steven now dedicates his time to inviting Gems to come to Little Homeworld, and educating those who do on how to find their new place in the galaxy. The official premise of the show was: "After saving the universe, Steven is still at it, tying up every loose end. But as he runs out of other people’s problems to solve, he’ll finally have to face his own." If we assume that the FLRW metric equations are valid all the way back to the beginning of our universe, then we can follow them back in time, to a point where the equations suggest all distances between objects in the universe were zero or infinitesimally small. (This does not necessarily mean the universe was physically small at the Big Bang, although that is indeed one of the possibilities.) Going forward, this provides a model of our universe which matches all current physical observations extremely closely. This initial period of the universe's chronology is called the "Big Bang".
