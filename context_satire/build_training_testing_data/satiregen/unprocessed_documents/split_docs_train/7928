Jennifer Granholm became the first female governor of Michigan on January 1, 2003, when she succeeded John Engler; she served for 8 years, until January 1, 2011. Granholm was born in Canada. Former governor George Romney was born in Mexico. In the 2002 election, incumbent Republican Governor John Engler was term-limited and not able to run for re-election to a fourth term in office. The Republicans unified around Engler's Lieutenant Governor, Dick Posthumus. Meanwhile, Granholm faced a competitive primary against former U.S. Ambassador to Canada and former Governor James Blanchard and U.S. Representative and former House Minority Whip David E. Bonior. The 1990 Michigan gubernatorial election was held on November 6, 1990, to elect the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the state of Michigan. John Engler, a member of the Republican Party and State Senate majority leader, was elected over Democratic Party nominee James Blanchard, who was seeking his third term. In what turned out to be one of the closest elections in recent Michigan history, Engler won by a 17,000 vote margin. The voter turnout was 38.6%.
