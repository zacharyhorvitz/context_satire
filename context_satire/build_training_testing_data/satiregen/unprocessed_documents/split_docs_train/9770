In 1925, Ruth Snyder was a housewife from Queens, a borough of New York City, who began an affair with Henry Judd Gray, a married corset salesman. She began to plan the murder of her husband Albert, enlisting Gray's help, though he appeared to be very reluctant. Ruth's distaste for her husband apparently began when he insisted on hanging a picture of his late fianc√©e Jessie Guischard on the wall of their first home, and named his boat after her. Guischard, whom Albert described to Ruth as "the finest woman I have ever met," had been dead for ten years. Snyder is a devout Evangelical Christian, and has spoken several times about her faith. In 2015, her testimonial was featured on I Am Second. In it, she spoke about the many deaths within her family and her previous failed marriages and how her faith helped her cope with these misfortunes. During her time on death row, Ruth Snyder wrote a sealed letter to be given to Lorraine "when she is old enough to understand". One year after her mother's execution, Lorraine was apparently aware that her parents were both dead, but not of the manner of either of their deaths.
