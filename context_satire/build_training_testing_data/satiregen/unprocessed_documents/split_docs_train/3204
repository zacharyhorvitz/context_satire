In Season 2 he is back to working in a mine and living with Ava on the condition that he has no part in illegal activities. Fellow miners recruit him to help rob the coal company they work for, Black Pike, but Boyd is wise to their true intentions of killing him once they have the money. He switches the money and the explosives so the men blow themselves up and not him. With a taste for the outlaw life again he rounds up his old crew including Johnny, Devil, and now Arlo and Ava. In Season 3 it is revealed that his deceased mother had left roughly $3,000,000 with a local banker and criminal, Elstin Limehouse, who is under obligation to release the money only to Dickie. Corrupt prison guards over hear this and break him out in order for him to take them to the money. When Dickie meets with Limehouse he is given a cooler filled with what Limeshouse claims is left of his mothers money, receipts and roughly $46,000. Knowing that Limehouse is holding out on him Dickie refuses to accept the cooler of cash and insists that Limehouse return to him all that he is owed.
