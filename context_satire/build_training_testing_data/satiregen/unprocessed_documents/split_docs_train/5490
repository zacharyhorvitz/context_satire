 Vice President Joe Biden wants a say in the direction of the Democratic Party as it picks up the pieces from a nightmare electoral loss this year -- and isn't willing to fully rule out a bid for the presidency if he thinks issues of economic fairness aren't being voiced. "Four years is a lifetime in American politics," he told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on "State of the Union." "And I think nominees are determined by their parties based mostly on what skill set is most needed at that time." "Who knows where we're going to be two years from now when people are really starting to look seriously at what they're going to do," he said.  Senators from both sides of the aisle spent part of Wednesday honoring the legacy of Vice President Joe Biden on the chamber floor. Biden served in the Senate for 36 years representing Delaware before spending eight years as vice president. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, was among those who took to the the podium to share Biden stories that both praised his character and included some of his trademark humor. "The amazing thing is the man we honor today wasn't always a talker," McConnell said.  Joe Biden told reporters Wednesday, "I have no intention of running" for president in 2020, the latest in what has been an eventful week for the vice president. Biden said this after the Senate paid tribute to his work earlier -- and as he headed into a reception in the Capitol. Biden stoked speculation this week that he might run for president -- something he did in 1988 and 2008 -- again. He told Stephen Colbert during an appearance on "The Late Show" on Tuesday night that he's learned to "never say never."
