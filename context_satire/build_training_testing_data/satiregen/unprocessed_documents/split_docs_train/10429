In January 2018, United plans to grow its company by adding between 4% and 6% to its passenger capacity this year and maintain that growth through 2020; this news caused all U.S. airline stocks to fall in value. Also, United in 2019 applied for more routes to Tokyo Haneda Airport, from its 6 U.S. hubs that didn't fly there. Most of these hubs will be replacing the Tokyo Narita route with Haneda.  Lufthansa says it hopes to resume a normal flight schedule on Saturday after two days of strikes forced it to cancel 1,500 flights, disrupting the travel plans of 200,000 customers. Germany's largest airline said in a statement Friday that flight operations will resume "as far as possible" on Saturday, but that there could still be cancellations or delays. A strike by flight attendants on Thursday and Friday was worse than anticipated, affecting 200 more flights and 20,000 more passengers than Lufthansa had initially predicted. The airline was forced to operate a "special flight plan" during the strike, with only 4,500 of the 6,000 planned flights taking off. The Board of Directors at Continental and United Airlines approved a stock-swap deal that would combine them into the world's largest airline on Sunday, May 2, 2010. The airlines publicly announced the deal the next day. This would re-unite Walter Varney's airlines, which offspring includes Continental and United.
