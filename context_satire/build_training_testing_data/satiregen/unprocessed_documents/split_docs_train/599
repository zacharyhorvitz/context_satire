The Goldbergs is set in the era in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania and shows the reality of the 1980s through a preadolescent's, and later in the series, teenager's, eyes. The show is loosely based on the showrunner's childhood, during which he regularly videotaped events - many of these videos are reenacted throughout the program, with the original version then shown before the end credits. Radio historians Frank Buxton and Bill Owen, in The Big Broadcast 1920â€“1950, noted the series (which they considered a soap opera as much as a comedy) "differed from most of the other 'soaps' in that its leading characters lived through relatively normal situations. Even though it was the story of a poor Jewish family in the Bronx, New York, it had identification for a wide segment of listeners". Of the 15-minute serial comedies, only Amos 'n' Andy enjoyed a longer radio life than The Goldbergs. The Goldbergs is an American television sitcom broadcast on ABC created by Adam F. Goldberg. The Goldbergs is set in the 1980s and follows the Goldberg family. The series stars Jeff Garlin as husband Murray, Wendi McLendon-Covey as wife Beverly, and their three children. Adam, the youngest, documents their lives with his video camera.
