Samantha Bond (born 27 November 1961) is an English actress, perhaps best known for playing Miss Moneypenny in four James Bond films during the series' Pierce Brosnan years, and for her role on Downton Abbey as the wealthy widow Lady Rosamund Painswick, sister of Robert Crawley, the Earl of Grantham. She is also well-known for originating the role of "Miz Liz" Probert in the Rumpole of the Bailey series. Bond is a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. At the age of 25, Bliss replaced the long-standing Lois Maxwell in the films The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill. She is the youngest actress to have played the role of Miss Moneypenny as the other actresses—Lois Maxwell, Samantha Bond and Naomie Harris—all began to play their roles at their thirties. In 1971, the role of Moneypenny was nearly recast after Maxwell demanded a pay raise for Diamonds Are Forever; Moneypenny's undercover policewoman's cap disguises the hair Maxwell had already dyed in preparation for another part. Initially, the character of Miss Moneypenny did not feature in the movie, but it was decided to add the scene where disguised as a customs officer, she gives Bond his travel documents at the port of Dover during production. The additional scene was a rather last-minute rewrite designed to include the character, as the producers felt it important to incorporate the regular character and actress Lois Maxwell. Maxwell and Connery filmed their lines separately and were not present together for the short scene However, she stayed on as Moneypenny when her former classmate, Roger Moore, assumed the role of 007 in Live and Let Die (1973).
