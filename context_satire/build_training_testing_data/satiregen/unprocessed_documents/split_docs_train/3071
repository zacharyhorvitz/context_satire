Since 1999, ShopRite has offered an online grocery shopping service on its website, under the service name ShopRite from Home. For an extra charge, a ShopRite employee fulfills a customer's shopping order at a local ShopRite; the customer then schedules either a home delivery or an at-store pick-up. In 1979 Basson wanted to move to trading fast-moving consumer goods and he reached an agreement with the board of Pep Stores which allowed him to either actively identify opportunities for acquisition of a food retailer or to start a new venture in food retailing. He found a small eight-store grocery chain in the Western Cape called Shoprite, still owned by the founding Rogut family, which he then acquired. "Barney Rogut was also fantastic to teach me food and he then taught me how to run a supermarket," said Basson. After meeting Bacall in Hollywood, Hawks immediately signed her to a seven-year contract, with a weekly salary of $100, and personally began to manage her career. He changed her first name to Lauren, and she chose "Bacall" (a variant of her mother's maiden name) as her screen surname. Slim Hawks also took Bacall under her wing, dressing Bacall stylishly and guiding her in matters of elegance, manners, and taste. At Hawks' suggestion, Bacall was also trained to make her voice lower and deeper, instead of her normal high-pitched, nasal voice.
