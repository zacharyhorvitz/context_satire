Bush was initially opposed to her son Jeb making a potential bid for the presidency; she believed that other families should have a try at the nation's highest office and that "we've had enough Bushes". However, she reversed her position and appeared in a campaign ad for him. Beginning in February 2016, she began campaigning for him in New Hampshire, an early voting state. Jeb Bush joked that a town hall meeting attended by his mother featured a larger gathering than town halls prior to her involvement.  One of Jim Cole's favorite photos from when he started photographing the New Hampshire primary shows Republican presidential candidates George H. W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Phil Crane and Howard Baker gathered at the iconic New Hampshire diner Yoken's in 1980 for a campaign event. "Back then there was nobody around, I'm the only photographer there at this morning meeting, unlike today where you'd get a whole bunch. In the early 80's this is the way the campaign was," Cole, a photographer for the Associated Press, told CNN. "I'm almost in his cup of coffee." In February 2016, at a town hall event in Hanover, New Hampshire following the Iowa Caucus, Bush's call for the country to elect a strong commander-in-chief was met with silence from the audience; in response, Bush said to the audience "Please clap." A video clip of the incident went viral and was lauded as a symbol of his campaign's sagging popularity.
