His young parents did their best to shelter him from the Detroit street crime and gang life: "My parents ain't really want me out the house. They did as much as they possibly could to keep me in the house with whatever the newest video game was. But you know you can only keep a kid in for so long. Plus that had me sheltered, so once I did get away I used to disappear for like four days." Zek attempted retirement shortly after the discovery of the wormhole near Bajor. He arrived on DS9 and during a business meeting announced Quark would be his successor, and then appeared to have died. Eventually it was discovered that Zek faked his death by entering into a trance his attendant Maihar'Du taught him. The whole set-up was a test to see if his son Krax was ready to take over, but Krax failed miserably: by trying to seize power (assisted by Rom); by attempting to kill Quark instead of acquiring it quietly. One of the people Opal meets is Miss Franny Block, a kind and somewhat eccentric elder librarian, who tells her many great stories, including one involving a bear. Opal also meets Gloria Dump, a blind recovering alcoholic with a tree in her backyard that has beer bottles hanging from it. She calls it a 'mistake tree' and the bottles represent the ghosts of all the things she has done wrong. One day, fed up with Winn-Dixie, the landlord of the Bullonis' trailer park, Mr. Alfred, orders the preacher to get rid of the dog.
