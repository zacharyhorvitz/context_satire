 Late Tuesday, the White House made clear that Dr. Ronny Jackson, President Donald Trump's pick to head the Veterans Affairs department, was not going to withdraw his nomination amid a panoply of questions about drinking on White House trips and doling out prescription pills to staffers overseas. Jackson, we were told, wants to stay and fight. He's not going anywhere. Which is his right.  During his joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday, President Donald Trump wanted to make two things very clear in regard to his embattled Veteran Affairs nominee, Ronny Jackson: Jackson is a terrific guy, a great physician and everyone likes him and Trump is totally behind him. Jackson needs to step aside. Notice anything strange about those two messages? Yes -- they are in total and complete contradiction!  When President Donald Trump named White House physician Ronny Jackson as his choice to be the next head of the Department of Veterans Affairs, it caught lots of people -- inside and outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- by surprise. After all, Jackson had never run an agency even close to the size of the VA. And, it appeared that Jackson's main appeal to Trump was their personal rapport -- as well as the clean bill of health Jackson had given Trump after his annual physical. (Jackson's performance at a news conference announcing the results of that physical didn't hurt either.) "He's like central casting -- like a Hollywood star," Trump said of Jackson in a speech to donors at his Mar-a-Lago resort in February.
