Collins began the 1907 season with Boston, but it was only a matter of time before he departed. For reasons that have never become clear, Stahl had committed suicide during spring training; instead of Collins, the Americans turned to Cy Young as manager, following by George Huff, and then Bob Unglaub, all within the first three months of the season. After playing 41 games with the Americans, Collins was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics in June for infielder John Knight. While he batted .278, he had a career-low (to that point) .330 slugging percentage, and failed to hit a home run for the first time in his career. In addition to his attainment as a practitioner of medicine, Dr. Collins wrote books and other literature. He is notable as the man who first reviewed James Joyce's novel Ulysses for the New York Times. His major writings, medical and secular, are: Collins recounted his early life in a 1997 interview: He was born to Luvadelle Bernice Collins of Crooksville, Ohio (homemaker), and a podiatrist, Joseph T. Collins (Cleveland College of Podiatry). He had two brothers, Jerry (US Navy) and Jeffery who were three and 16 years younger than he, respectively. He and his brother were excluded from Boy Scouts for being "too rowdy". (Despite this, in his adult life he was a supporter of the Scouts and served on the Friends of Hidden Valley Girl Scout Board of Directors in Lawrence).
