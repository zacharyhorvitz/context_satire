In early 1996, Donald's bandmates Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Jason Orange came to the difficult decision that Take That was to split. They told Donald, who was not happy, but went along with their decision. In the 2006 documentary, Take That for the Record, Donald shocked bandmates with his confession of being unstable enough to have the intention of committing suicide by drowning himself in the River Thames, not long after the split. In August 2013, the headline act to turn on the Blackpool illuminations pulled out due to unforeseen circumstances leaving the event with no one to turn on the lights or play to the 5,000 in attendance. Upon hearing this, Barlow tweeted that he would step in if the organisers would write a cheque to Children In Need. Bosses quickly made contact with him and made a donation to the charity, with Barlow turning on the lights and performing a number of his hits during the 45 minute set. Simon Blackburn, Leader of Blackpool Council said: "Garyâ€™s very generous offer on Twitter was extremely flattering and as soon as we saw it we contacted him straight away to take him up on it. Donald was educated at Littlemoss High School in Droylsden and worked as a vehicle painter. As a teenager he was interested in dancing and frequented the burgeoning breakdancing circuit in the Greater Manchester area, where he would first come into contact with future bandmate Jason Orange. He auditioned for Nigel Martin-Smith's new boy band project at his office in Manchester and was selected. The group was eventually named Take That.
