 In the biggest speech of his still young political career, GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan told the Republican National Convention on Wednesday that time is running out to solve the nation's fiscal problems, but Mitt Romney and he can do it if elected in November. "We will not duck the tough issues -- we will lead," Ryan said in his prime time address televised nationwide. "... The work ahead will be hard.  Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan has a carefully crafted reputation as a deficit hawk on Capitol Hill and used those credentials to attack the growth of the federal debt on President Barack Obama's watch. "He created a bipartisan debt commission. They came back with an urgent report. He thanked them, sent them on their way and then did exactly nothing," Ryan, who served on that panel, told the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night.  Tonight at the Republican National Convention, vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan will take the state to address the party. This morning on "Starting Point," Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) talks with John Berman about playing Ryan in debate preps with Vice President Joe Biden, and the latest on Hurricane Isaac. Van Hollen first addresses questions of whether President Obama should be campaigning while Hurricane Isaac is battering the Gulf Coast. "The President has been on top of this storm from the beginning," he says.
