Furthermore, he elaborated that he learned from a very early age that it was important for them as kids to help provide for the home, to be contributors rather than takers. Walton realized while serving in the army, that he wanted to go into retailing and to go into business for himself. World War I veteran John will do anything to protect his family; he also wishes to see all of his children graduate from college, which he was unable to do. Despite his Baptist upbringing he, like his father Zeb, is distrustful of organized religion, though he is by no means an atheist. He holds life sacred and honors God as the creator of it. He does not approve of hunting animals for sport, but will hunt to provide food for his family. Ben (Eric Scott) is named for his father John's brother Ben, who was killed in France during World War I. Fifth-born Ben seems to get into trouble at precisely the wrong times and possesses fiery red hair and a temper to match. He has a bright mind and an entrepreneurial spirit but sometimes falls for get-rich-quick schemes and needs his father or John-Boy to bail him out. Even as an adult, running the sawmill in partnership with his father, he makes deals that don't turn out well. As an adolescent, he takes many jobs and strives to prove his maturity to the family, who he believed looked on him as a “child.” Underneath his quick temper and bravado, Ben is a kind, compassionate person who cares very deeply for his family.
