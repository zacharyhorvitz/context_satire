Allegheny Riverfront Park is a municipal park that runs along the south bank of the Allegheny River in Downtown Pittsburgh. It is a parcel of the Three Rivers Park, the city's grand urban waterfront park project along its rivers that will provide a continuous green trail   connecting existing and future riverfront developments. Completed segments include North Shore Riverfront Park, South Shore Riverfront Park, and Point State Park. The boundaries of the park are the Ninth Street Pier and Fort Duquesne Bridge. Riverfront Park, branded as Riverfront Spokane by the Spokane Parks and Recreation Department, is a public park in the northwest United States, in downtown Spokane, Washington. The one-hundred-acre (40 ha) park is located along the Spokane River containing the upper Spokane Falls and just upstream from the lower falls.It was created 46 years ago for Expo '74, a World's Fair event. The defining feature of the park is the Pavilion, which is marked by a 145-foot-tall (44 m) metal frame and wire shell that formed the US Pavilion tent during Expo '74, and the 155-foot (47 m) clock tower, now a Spokane icon. Originally part of the Great Northern Railway Depot, completed in 1902 and demolished in 1973, its "giant grandfather clock" is wound by hand once a week. Newark Riverfront Park is a park and promenade being developed in phases along the Passaic River in Newark, New Jersey, United States. The park, expected to be 3 miles (4.8 km) long and encompass 30.5 acres (12.3 ha), is being created from brownfield sites along the river, which itself is a Superfund site due to decades of pollution. It will follow the river between the Ironbound section along Raymond Boulevard and Downtown Newark along McCarter Highway. Announced in 1999, a groundbreaking took place in 2008, and the first phase of the park opened in 2012.
