In February 2018, Bouchard provided her first public account of incident at her trial against the USTA in federal court in Brooklyn. Bouchard told the court that after returning to the locker room she changed into a bathing-ready outfit, walked toward the baths, which are through the trainers' room, and took two steps into the trainers' room, falling and hitting her head on the tile floor. Bouchard elaborated that her first reaction after falling was a burning sensation caused by a cleaning solution used on the floor, later identified in the trial as Oasis 299, a heavy-duty cleaning product that can cause "skin burns" according to its safety data sheet. Bouchard then claimed that she told a locker room attendant that she had slipped and fallen, to which the attendant expressed surprise that Bouchard had entered the room. On February 5, 2017, during Super Bowl LI, between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons, Bouchard took to Twitter to predict that Atlanta would win. A bet was proposed by a fan named John Goehrke in reply to her tweet with a proposal that Bouchard would go on a date with him if the Patriots won the game, and she agreed. The Patriots went on to beat the Falcons 34â€“28. She later released a statement on her Twitter handle quoting, "I will do it, I stay true to my word". At the start of the season, Bouchard attempted to qualify for the main draw at the Apia International Sydney, but lost to Storm Sanders in the first round of the qualifiers. She played the qualifiers for the Australian Open and was eliminated by Daria Gavrilova in the second round. Bouchard played in the main draw of the Copa Bionaire in Cali, Colombia. She beat Laura Thorpe in the opening round but lost to Russian Alexandra Panova in the next round.
