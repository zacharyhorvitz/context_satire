The recent changes of the News Feed algorithm (see content : News Feed#History) are expected to improve “the amount of meaningful content viewed”. To this end, the new algorithm is supposed to determine the publications around which a user is most likely to interact with his friends, and make them appear higher in the News Feed instead of items for example from media companies or brands. These are posts “that inspire back-and-forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to”. But, as even Mark Zuckerberg admitted, he “expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down.  For at least 17 minutes on Friday, a suspected terrorist streamed to Facebook live video of a mass murder, and Facebook apparently had to be told about it by New Zealand police. This despite Facebook repeatedly touting over the past two years its hiring of thousands of content moderators and its investment in artificial intelligence for content moderation. If the artificial intelligence systems built by one of the richest companies in the world can't identify and take action on a video containing weaponry, repeated gunfire and murder, what can they identify? Well, broccoli, for one thing. Facebook has a real-name system policy for user profiles. The real-name policy stems from the position "that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe." The real-name system does not allow adopted names or pseudonyms, and in its enforcement has suspended accounts of legitimate users, until the user provides identification indicating the name.
