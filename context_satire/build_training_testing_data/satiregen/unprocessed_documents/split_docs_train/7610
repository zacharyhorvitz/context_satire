 The sudden resignation of CIA chief David Petraeus over the revelation of an extramarital affair means that he will not be testifying before Congress this Thursday on the deaths of four Americans at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. On Starting Point this morning, Rep. Jason Chaffetz insists that Petraeus should still testify, saying that he doesn't want to "let a salacious story distract from the fact that the General should put his duty and his honor front and foremost." Chaffetz also responds to the latest reports about Gen. John Allen's involvement in the scandal and weighs in on the timeline of the FBI's revelations. "I want to make sure the president is fully engaged," Rep. Chaffetz says. In the days following Obama's re-election in November 2012, he had to face the ramifications of the Petraeus scandal. Media reported that angry congressional leaders were demanding answers about the Petraeus affair and "why they were given zero advance notice of the spymaster’s lively love life." An article in TIME probed "The Petraeus Affair: Why Was Obama Kept in the Dark?"  House Majority Leader Eric Cantor knew in October about former CIA Director David Petraeus' involvement in an extramarital affair, a spokesman for the congressman told CNN on Sunday. Doug Heye said Cantor, a Republican, was tipped to the information by an FBI employee. The congressman had a conversation with the official, described as a whistle-blower, about the affair and national security concerns involved in the matter, he said. The New York Times reported Saturday that on October 31, Cantor's chief of staff phoned the FBI to inform the agency about the call between the congressman and the FBI official.
