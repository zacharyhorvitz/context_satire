 Despite a ballyhooed charm offensive by President Barack Obama, political leaders continued talking past each other on Tuesday in proposing partisan ideas on taxes and spending that have zero chance of winning congressional approval. Obama met with Senate Democrats in the first of three visits to Capitol Hill this week for face time with legislators from both parties. The rare personal appearances by the president, a former senator, follow his newly unveiled outreach efforts that included dinner with Senate Republicans and lunch with two influential House members last week, as well as phone calls to various legislators from both parties. Obama offered no comment to reporters when entering and departing Tuesday's meeting with senators, while White House spokesman Jay Carney rejected any inference that the meetings and phone calls by the president were just for show.  Conventional wisdom among politicos on both sides of the aisle is that House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's continued quest to repeal Obamacare has a snowball's chance in heck of going anywhere. So when the former vice presidential nominee and potential 2016 presidential contender told Chris Wallace on "Fox News Sunday" that his plan to balance the budget in a decade included a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the veteran news host echoed how many in Washington view the topic. "Well, that's not going to happen," Wallace told his guest. "Well, we believe it should," Ryan responded.  House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan will release the latest version of his budget proposal on Tuesday. The 2014 plan, he promises, will balance the federal budget in 10 years. Is that possible? Most budget experts say it is would be tough -- both practically and politically.
