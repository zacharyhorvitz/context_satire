It is revealed that Rebecca had had an appointment with a Doctor Baker in London shortly before her death, presumably to confirm her pregnancy. When the doctor is found, he reveals that Rebecca had been suffering from cancer and would have died within a few months. Furthermore, due to the malformation of her uterus, she could never have been pregnant. Maxim assumes that Rebecca, knowing that she was going to die, manipulated him into killing her quickly. Foster began his professional MMA career in 2006, after his brother died. In an interview with FightLockdown.com, Foster stated that "martial arts have changed me, it's made me a more humble and respectful individual. My brother’s death did make me a very angry person, so very shortly after it happened, I started training and used the physical stress of training to cancel out the emotional pain caused by his death. I like to think he is very proud of what I have accomplished since his passing  I take a photo of my brother with me to every fight." In rehearsal for a performance of Sotto Voce II – the piece Wolfgang wrote for the Busoni Competition, and which I had the honour of premiering – he provided an exemplary example of at least one kind of performer-composer relationship. At one point the conductor turned to Wolfgang and asked (over my head, literally and figuratively) whether I was “allowed” to play a certain phrase in the way I was choosing to. Without hesitation, Wolfgang said “He’s the interpreter: he can do what he wants.” Apart from immediately resolving the power-struggle that sometimes exists between concerto soloist and conductor (I could have kissed him for that), Wolfgang’s gesture was a hugely important one for me: it was an expression of trust, and curiosity about what I would produce.
