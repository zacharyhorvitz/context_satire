 What do Lil Nas X, Steely Dan and Lizzo have in common? Maybe nothing other than that they're all high up on former President Barack Obama's summer 2019 playlist -- but that's a pretty cool place to be. "With summer winding down, here's a sampling of what Michelle and I have been listening to — some new, some old, some fast, some slow," he wrote on Twitter. "Hope you enjoy." During Barack Obama's campaign for president in 2008, throughout his presidency, and afterwards, a number of conspiracy theories falsely asserted Obama was ineligible to be President of the United States because he was not a natural-born citizen of the U.S. as required by Article Two of the Constitution. The congressional committee released the full schedule of the January 20 inaugural events on December 17, 2008. The inauguration schedule referred to the President‑elect as "Barack H. Obama", although Obama specified previously that he intended to use his full name for his swearing-in ceremony, including his middle name Hussein. Obama decided to use his full name "Barack Hussein Obama" to "follow the tradition, not trying to make a statement one way or the other" for the inaugural ceremony. During the election campaign, Obama's detractors tried to use his middle name to imply falsely that he was a Muslim.
