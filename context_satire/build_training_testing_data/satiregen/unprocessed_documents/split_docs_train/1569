After 24 years as California's junior senator, Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) announced her intention to retire from the United States Senate at the end of her term in 2016. Harris was the first candidate to declare her intention to run for Boxer's senate seat. Media outlets reported that she would run for senate on the same day that Gavin Newsom, California's Lieutenant Governor and a close political ally of Harris, announced he would not seek to succeed Boxer. Harris officially announced the launch of her campaign on January 13, 2015.  Kamala Harris announced Monday that she is running for president in 2020, arguing that the time has come to fight against what she views as the injustices of the past two years of the Trump presidency. In a brief video from her campaign that was released on social media Monday morning at the same time she appeared on ABC's "Good Morning America," Harris called on her supporters to join with her to "claim our future." "Justice. Decency.  Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign says she raised $1.5 million online in just 24 hours after declaring she would run for president in 2020. The campaign released snapshots of fundraising data that reflected an initial surge of financial support for the California Democrat. The numbers could not immediately be independently confirmed by CNN, and a more complete picture will be available when the campaign files its first Federal Election Commission report after the first quarter of the year. The campaign says the $1.5 million came from over 38,000 individual donors, from all 50 states, with an average contribution of $37, and $1 million was raised in just the first 12 hours after the announcement.
