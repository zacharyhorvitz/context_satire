On September 11, Ingram visits Finch while he is working on a new program, in order to break the tragic news of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center earlier that day. As they both watch the news in shock, Ingram tells Finch that while they have changed as they aged, the world has not until this moment. Ingram proposes that they try to change the world for the better ("One Percent"). Back in their apartment, after having killed the couple, they tried to remove all the traces that would ever prove they have been there. Stanton told him that they could take a break, but Reese said that he was fine. So Stanton drew out a gun on him and wanted him to choose between being a boy scout or a killer because she was tired of working with both. She also reminded him that he chose this life. Using her own sources, independent of Reese and Finch, Zoe figured out that the woman in the recording was Dana Miller, a former employee of Virtanen, who was going to blow the whistle about one of their drugs and was killed for her trouble. She chose to take down Virtanen with her information because she knew a girl once whose situation "kind of reminds  of Dana" (and only partially because they tried to kill her).
