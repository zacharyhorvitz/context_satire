Tony Danza (born Antonio Salvatore Iadanza; April 21, 1951) is an American actor, television personality, tap dancer, boxer and teacher who starred on the TV series Taxi and Who's the Boss?, for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award and four Golden Globe Awards. In 1998, Danza won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Performer in a New Television Series for his work on the 1997 sitcom The Tony Danza Show (not to be confused with his 2004–2006 daytime variety talk show of the same name). He has also appeared in films such as Don Jon, Angels in the Outfield, The Hollywood Knights, Going Ape! and Crash. Danza, a native New Yorker, is on the board of directors of the city's Police Athletic League, and "will be able to draw on his real-life connection to the NYPD" to develop his character and role. The first season is being filmed in various neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Later in the show's run, it was reported that Danza was exhibiting erratic behavior on the set. These stories ranged from Danza getting after the directors, to arguments with the writers over minor script revisions. While it was uncovered that only the writing became an issue for Danza, his frustrations to have the show be a "well-oiled machine" boiled over at the start of the 1989–90 season, when he staged a walkout for two weeks until he calmed down. In the meantime, the remainder of the cast filmed scenes without him.
