Sam and Derek both suspect that Mitch is the werewolf. Later Charlie pays Derek a visit to see if he's alright. Derek arrives, but another group of teenagers go to the cabin to investigate the previous massacre (a running gag in the film).

Eventually, they set Mitch on fire and the cabin burns down.
