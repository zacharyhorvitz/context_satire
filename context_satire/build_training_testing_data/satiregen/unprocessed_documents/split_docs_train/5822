 NEWSFLASH: Donald Trump is perfectly mentally capable of being president and is suffering from no cognitive impairment or decline. That statement, delivered by White House physician Ronny Jackson following Trump's physical last week, amounts to a direct rebuttal to a growing pet conspiracy theory among Trump haters: That he is in the midst of a rapid mental deterioration that necessitates the invoking of the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. " has absolutely no cognitive or mental issues whatsoever," Jackson said in a briefing on the President's health for reporters on Tuesday. He added that having observed Trump closely over the past year-plus, he felt no need to do any sort of cognitive testing but did so at the request of the President.  President Donald Trump, hoping to rebut questions about his mental fitness, requested the White House physician perform a cognitive exam during his yearly exam last week. The President, 71, received a perfect score, the doctor said Tuesday during an extraordinary hour-long questioning session at the White House. And despite high cholesterol and borderline obesity, he declared Trump is in "excellent" health. "I've got to know him pretty well.  White House doctor Ronny Jackson says President Donald Trump is "in excellent health" following his physical Friday. In a brief statement, Jackson said, "The President's physical exam today at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center went exceptionally well. The President is in excellent health and I look forward to briefing some of the details on Tuesday." Doctors and nurses poked and prodded Trump on Friday during his first known medical checkup since taking office, the results of which will provide the most accurate gauge yet of how a year being commander in chief has worn on the presidential frame.
