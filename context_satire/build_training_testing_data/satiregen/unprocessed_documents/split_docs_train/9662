 Silicon Valley has introduced an entirely new word into the story of San Francisco: "Super-gentrification." The influx of wealthy tech-industry types has had a staggering affect on the city's affordability, and the disparity between the rich and poor hasn't gone unnoticed. Worse, that income gap is growing. The median household income in San Francisco is about $90,000, and low-income families bring in half that.  Let's start with the good news: Washington, D.C., has one of the highest concentrations of graduate degrees in the country. It's a place full of smart, wealthy and educated people. Now for the bad news: It also has the highest poverty rate of any U.S. city, and the youth feel it especially badly. "Disconnected youth" -- defined as those who are unemployed and out of school -- make up 32% of the city's population of 16- to 24-year-olds, or about 10,000 people, according to Raise D.C., a coalition of public, private and nonprofit groups. Brookings traces its history back to 1916 and has contributed to the creation of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan, and the Congressional Budget Office, as well as to the development of influential policies for deregulation, broad-based tax reform, welfare reform, and foreign aid. The annual think tank index published by Foreign Policy ranks it the number one think tank in the U.S. and the Global Go To Think Tank Index believes it is the number one such tank in the world. Moreover, in spite of an overall decline in the number of times information or opinions developed by think tanks are referred to by the US media, of the 200 most prominent think tanks in the U.S., the Brookings Institution's research remains the most frequently cited.
