The International AIDS Society (IAS) is an association of HIV professionals, with 11,035 members from more than 160 countries working at all levels of the global HIV response. Its mission is to lead collective action on every front through its membership base, scientific authority and convening power. IAS members include researchers from all disciplines, clinicians, public health and community practitioners on the frontlines of the epidemic, as well as policy makers and programme implementers. The IAS is the steward of the world's two most prestigious HIV conferences: the biennial International AIDS Conference and the IAS Conference on HIV Science. On April 28, 1956, the New York Coliseum opened in New York City. Prompted by the opening of the convention center, and by comments from leaders of the Cleveland Convention and Visitors Bureau (who indicated the city was losing convention business due to the small size of Public Auditorium), Cleveland City Council member Joseph Horwitz introduced a resolution in May to require the city to study the construction of a new convention center. In June, Mayor Celebrezze proposed that the "international center" be built as the new convention center. Celebrezze's proposal enlarged the scheme by having the building extend toward the Lake Erie shore, and extending an ell eastward over the space then occupied by stadium parking lots. By 1996, the Cleveland Convention Center was again losing business to other cities. Potential users felt it was too dimly lit, the ceilings were too low, there were not enough meeting rooms, and the facility felt old. In September of that year, the CCVB issued a report calling for a new convention center, one nearly 60 percent larger and with five times as much meeting room space. This plan set in motion 13 years of discussion, planning, and voter initiatives to build a new convention center.
