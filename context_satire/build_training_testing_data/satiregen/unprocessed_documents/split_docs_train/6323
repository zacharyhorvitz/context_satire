Bloodbrothers is the third album by The Dictators and their second after switching to the Asylum label. AllMusic, which was critical of the band's previous album, released a favorable review of Bloodbrothers, stating that it "stands as a good example of what the band sounded like on a good night", as well as calling it "The Dictators' most rockingest and most musical album." "Faster and Louder" features an uncredited guest appearance from Bruce Springsteen.
