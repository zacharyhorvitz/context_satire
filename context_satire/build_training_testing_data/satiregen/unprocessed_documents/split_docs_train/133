 The Navy SEAL behind the much-anticipated first-hand account of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden has been unmasked this morning by several news organizations. Although CNN has confirmed the name of the SEAL, the decision to not publish his identity honors a request from the pentagon. Pentagon officials say the book "No Easy Day" could have dangerous repercussions. The member of SEAL Team Six, who is now retired, wrote the book under the pseudonym Mark Owen.  A book company said Wednesday that it will release on September 11 a firsthand account of the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Christine Ball, director of marketing and publicity for Dutton, a subsidiary of Penguin Group USA, said the book was written by a Navy SEAL under a pen name. Although CNN has confirmed the name of the SEAL, the network agreed not to publish his identity at the request of Pentagon officials who said the information might lead to other SEALs on the raid being identified through social media links. After The Associated Press and Fox News reported the SEAL's name online Thursday, many other websites, including The New York Times and USA Today, published his identity.  The author of the yet-to-be-published book "No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden" wrote it under the pseudonym Mark Owen. The book's publisher said the special operations forces team member did not want to reveal his name to protect himself and his family. But only a day after the New York Times first reported the book was coming out, Fox News reported the author's real name on its website and posted photos of him in combat gear.
