Maude "Maude the Ice Cream Lady" Hanson  is the owner of the Cherry Popper Ice Cream Factory before Tommy Vercetti purchases her business. Featured in only one cut scene, she claims that her business serves as a big front for selling "other, non-dairy and non-legal products." Maude also exhibits psychotic hatred towards children and uses stereotypes of children claiming that they are disgusting, spoiled and bratty. She is also believed to have once run a children's home. Changes were relatively few over the Century's nine-year run. The all-new Buick LaCrosse replaced both the Century and Regal. A limited run of Centurys with special trim were produced for 2005 to mark the end of the name. GM rolled the last Buick Century off the Oshawa assembly line on October 25, 2004. After the 1998 discontinuation of the Skylark, the Century became Buick's entry-level car for the first time. For 2003, all trim levels were eliminated, leaving one standard model. Additionally, the "Century" nameplate on the front doors was dropped, and only seen on the vehicle's tail lights.
