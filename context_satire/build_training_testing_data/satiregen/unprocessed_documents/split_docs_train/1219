Once inside the facility, Jay and Silent Bob find a tranquilizer gun and the ape, an orangutan named Suzanne (a reference to the ending scene in "Mallrats"). After springing her from her cage, Silent Bob becomes sympathetic for the other animals, so they let them loose, as well. In the meantime, the four women escape with the diamonds and place a bomb on the van; Jay and Silent Bob witness the van explode, and while assuming that Justice is dead, they manage to escape just as the authorities arrive. In August 2001, three weeks prior to release, the film came under fire from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), for its "overwhelmingly homophobic tone", which included an abundance of gay jokes and characters excessively using the term "gay" to mean something derogatory. The scenes deemed particularly offensive included Jay's vehement refusal of giving oral sex to a male driver when hitchhiking, and Jay chastising Silent Bob for being willing to perform fellatio on him to get the security guard to let them go. Following an advance screening of the film, former GLAAD media director Scott Seomin asked Smith to make a $10,000 donation to the Matthew Shepard Foundation, as well as to include a reference to GLAAD's cause in the ending credits. Smith and Severin meanwhile co-wrote the music to the Marc and the Mambas song "Torment", which also featured the Venomettes, and appeared on the album Torment and Toreros, while the Venomettes (McCarrick, Stephenson and Hewes) all performed strings in the studio with the Glove. Between March and June 1983, Smith was in the studio recording with the Glove, Siouxsie and the Banshees and (ostensibly) the Cure; prompting him to remark: "I need a holiday ... I keep making plans to go every week, but every week I'm in another group."
