Collette Brown plays Sam Kennedy, an SHO who appears from series three, episode 19 until series four, episode 45. Sam meets registrar Alex Adams in the hospital bar. They sleep together, and the next morning discover they are colleagues. They begin a relationship, but he leaves because he discovers she was secretly buying him drink doubles which caused him to knock a child over. Joseph Millson plays Luc Hemingway, an eccentric and extremely intelligent specialist registrar. He first appears in November 2011, episode "Under The Skin", while on the roof with Nurse Eddi McKee. His double fellowship and unsociable manner winds Eddi (Sarah Jane Potts) up, and causes lots of hilariously funny banter to be batted between them. In the episode "Ribbons", he kisses her, but the aftermath of the kiss shows that he offered no explanation and even disappeared from the ward to focus on research to avoid her. Frieda's return to Holby sees her struggle to adjust to working as a doctor and with new colleague, registrar Luc Hemingway (Joseph Millson). She is also under pressure to complete her F1 portfolio on time. Frieda fears that she has failed her F1 rotation when she is summoned to Henrik Hanssen's (Guy Henry) office, but is pleased to learn that she received the best score in the region and is now an F2, working on Keller ward. While working on Keller, Frieda finds herself caught between Dan Hamilton (Adam Astill) and Malick, who both want to supervise her on her first day.
