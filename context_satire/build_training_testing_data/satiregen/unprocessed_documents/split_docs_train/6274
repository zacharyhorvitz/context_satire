 The controversy over the comments that Mitt Romney made about Obama supporters during a private fundraiser in May continues to unfold this morning after secretly recorded videos of the meeting were leaked last night. Regarding the millions of Americans who rely on government support, Romney comments, "My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." Romney campaign senior adviser Bay Buchanan responds to the backlash over the comments on Starting Point this morning.  Fighting criticism of his controversial remarks on government dependency, Republican challenger Mitt Romney said Wednesday that he would better help poor and middle class Americans than President Barack Obama. Romney and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan also sought to reshape the campaign narrative less than seven weeks before the November vote by accusing Obama of favoring wealth redistribution -- code for socialism among conservatives -- based on a 1998 video of the president as a state Senate candidate in Illinois. America does not work by government making people dependent on government, Romney told a fundraising event in Atlanta, adding "that will kill the American entrepreneurship that's lifted our economy over the years." "The question of this campaign is not who cares about the poor and the middle class?  Mitt Romney on Tuesday didn't back away from remarks he made in a secretly recorded video casting supporters of President Barack Obama as dependent on welfare, and instead said the comments that generated more problems for him in a tight race were an honest reflection of his campaign's message. "This is a message I'm carrying day and day out and will carry over the coming months," Romney said on Fox News. "This is a decision about the course of America, where we're going to head. We've seen the president's policies play out over the last four years."
