 President Trump, please stay away from Phoenix. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton put it another way,  in a statement ahead of Donald Trump's planned rally in Phoenix on Tuesday:  "I am disappointed that President Trump has chosen to hold a campaign rally as our nation is still healing from the tragic events in Charlottesville." While Stanton noted that the Constitution protects the right to free speech -- and that the Phoenix Convention Center can be rented by anyone --  he hoped Trump would delay his visit. The mayor is right.  America -- why are you surprised? The Donald Trump who on Saturday and again on Tuesday drew an equivalency between the "very fine people" (his words) among those protesting with neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, and those that opposed this event as an affront to America's foundations is the same Donald Trump millions of people supported and the electoral college put in the White House. Trump failed to condemn white supremacists and blamed "many sides" for the violence that erupted when a group of white nationalists and neo-Nazis gathered in Virginia this weekend to march and protest the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue. And even after a car plowed through a crowd, killing a woman, Trump still failed to approach this moment with much needed presidential leadership.  Many newspaper front pages on Wednesday featured a photo of President Trump with headlines that mentioned him by name. They touched on themes from his blustery speech at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona. The Arizona Republic took a different approach. In large black letters that eclipsed the font size of the masthead read the words "Violence Erupts."
