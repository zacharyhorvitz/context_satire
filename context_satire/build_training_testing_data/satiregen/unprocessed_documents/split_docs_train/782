 The University of Southern California hired Andy Enfield to become the Trojans head basketball coach on Monday, completing a Cinderella season for the rising star. The former Florida Gulf Coast coach led the No. 15 seeded Eagles to the NCAA Sweet 16 -- the first time that feat has been accomplished. "Andy has been successful in every area of his life," said USC Athletic Director Pat Haden.  Florida Gulf Coast University, the biggest surprise in this year's NCAA tournament, is suddenly the hottest school in terms of new fan interest too. Sales at the school's on campus book store shot up 1,000% on Saturday, the day after its upset win versus Georgetown, compared to a year ago, according to figures from Follett Higher Education Group. Follett is a private company that manages more than 900 university stores, including the one at FGCU. The store was closed on Sunday, but online sales were going crazy as the school beat San Diego State to become the first 15th seed ever to advance to the Sweet 16.
