Early into the Carters' time out of the White House, Rosalynn retained sour feelings toward the loss and questioned her faith as to how her husband could not be re-elected despite what she believed were good choices he had undertaken during his presidency. In a 1984 interview, Carter was asked about her opinions on the 1984 Presidential election, saying she was unsure if it was the right time for a female vice presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket and that the most important thing for the Democrats should be winning against Reagan, who she charged with committing a tragedy with his policies. Carter also voiced her wishes for her husband to run for a second non-consecutive term. She knew in her heart that her husband would not seek a non-consecutive term and went into depression in the early weeks of the retirement, Jimmy's attempts at portraying an artificial happiness straining the relationship due to him seeming to not understand her reasons for being disappointed in their current state of affairs.  With a healthy dose of humor and grit, Jimmy Carter returned to the pulpit to deliver his first Sunday School lesson since breaking his hip last month. The air conditioning had gone out in Maranatha Church in Plains, Georgia, and the audience fanned their faces feverishly. But the heat didn't stop the nation's oldest former president from delivering a lesson at the church where he and wife, Rosalynn, have been members since shortly after they departed the White House. At this particular lesson, Carter, 94, talked about his health, his first conversation with President Trump, and his vision for the future of the country. By the time his son Jimmy was four years old, Carter had purchased a new home. When he took the children to see the house, he realized that he had left his key behind. A wooden bar allowed only a small space for the windows to open, too small to allow access for an adult. Carter sent Jimmy through the window to open the door.
