 The Democratic presidential candidates are converging at the Iowa State Fair this week, jostling for attention as they deliver their speeches from the soapbox. They will have a chance to flip pork chops, visit the famed Butter Cow and cheer on the junior ranchers and farmers who are trying their hand at mutton busting. Inevitably, most of them will be coaxed into eating meat on a stick. (This year, the featured delicacy is bacon-wrapped-bacon). On January 23, 2019, Pete Buttigieg announced the formation of an exploratory committee to run for President of the United States in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He had attracted speculation as a potential presidential candidate, notably following his visit to the early caucus state of Iowa in December 2018, where he announced that he would not seek reelection as mayor of South Bend.  Joe Biden arrived in Iowa on Wednesday to deliver a major speech condemning President Donald Trump's racism and -- in an effort to prove his strength as a general election candidate -- promising that "we can't, and I will not, let this man be reelected." But soon after that high point, a series of verbal stumbles began for the former vice president. He referred to "white kids" when he meant "wealthy kids" and confused former British Prime Minister Theresa May with Margaret Thatcher on Thursday. Then, on Saturday, he twice claimed to have met with students who survived the Parkland school shooting as vice president, even though that shooting happened more than a year after Biden left office.
