Angharad McAllister, played by Amanda Wenban, made her debut screen appearance in December 1993. Former Families actress Amanda Wenban was cast in the role of matriarch Angharad. A writer for Inside Soap described Angharad as a "middle-class mum". The character moves to Beckindale with her family and takes up a teaching position at the local school. Luke meets Ben's sister Tina Dingle (Jacqueline Pirie) at a dance and he falls in love with her. They date and Tina later tells Luke that she is pregnant, much to the dismay of both families. They agree to get married, but on the day Tina reveals to Luke and the wedding guests that she does not love him, there is no baby, and it was all in aid of revenge for Ben. Luke is badly affected by the revelations. Angharad arrives in the village with her husband Bernard (Brendan Price) and their two children, Jessica (Camilla Power) and Luke (Noah Huntley). She takes a position at the local comprehensive school and helps out during the aftermath of the plane crash. Angharad and Bernard became respected by the village residents and they both helped out with Alan Turner's (Richard Thorp) wedding preparations. During a benefit night, Angharad took to the stage to cavort with the semi-clad "Nobbies", an all-male stripper act.
