Drake's Cakes is a brand of  American baked goods. The company was founded by Newman E. Drake in 1896 in Harlem, New York as The N.E. Drake Baking Company, but it is now owned by McKee Foods. The company makes snack cake products such as Devil Dogs, Funny Bones, Coffee Cakes, Ring Dings, and Yodels. Snack cakes can be found in many American supermarkets and convenience stores, sold either individually or by the box. Examples include Drake's Devil Dogs, Twinkies and zebra cakes. Well-known American manufacturers of snack cakes include Hostess, Little Debbie, Dolly Madison,Tastykake and Drake's. In 2004, the snack-cake industry in the US experienced major consolidation, which resulted in fewer products being offered to consumers. McKee Foods has its headquarters beside the campus and has been an important part of school history as one of the companies which have provided jobs within walking distance for students to fund their education. It was founded by a Southern alumnus and is the headquarters for Little Debbie, Sovex and Sunbelt products. McKee Foods is one of the largest employers in Hamilton County.
