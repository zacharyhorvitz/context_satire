Jen decides not to leave, and returns home to find Spencer fighting off his best friend Henry (Rob Riggle), secretly a fellow assassin, who reveals that a $20 million bounty has been placed on Spencer and that anyone in his life could be an assassin. A sniper opens fire on the house, and Spencer and Jen flee. They lead Henry on a car chase through the neighborhood and ram his car onto rebar, killing him. After they find Holbrook dead in his hotel room, Jen vomits and realizes she may be pregnant. Three years later, Spencer and Jen have settled into their married life. When she surprises him with tickets to Nice for his birthday, Spencer is less than enthusiastic, which Jen's friends convince her is a sign he is bored with their relationship. Spencer receives a "romantic" postcard from Holbrook and is given an ultimatum to take another assignment. Trying to refuse the job over the phone, Spencer hangs up suddenly when Jen's father arrives, prompting Mr. Kornfeldt’s suspicion; he also notices the postcard.  A Florida mom was arrested for sticking up to her son’s 17-year-old bully at a bus stop yesterday. The fight continued on the bus, and her son says he’s proud of his mom for defending him.
