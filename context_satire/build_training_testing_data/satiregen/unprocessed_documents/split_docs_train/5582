 At first glance, a gathering of global elites focused on the world community -- in Switzerland, no less! -- would not seem like the sort of crowd with which Donald Trump would like to fraternize. After all, Trump spent the entirety of the 2016 campaign promising to put "America First" and "Make America Great Again." He's pursued a similar agenda in the White House, insisting international trade deals involving the United States need to be re-examined and pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accords. The day after Trump's impeachment, the evangelical magazine Christianity Today published an editorial calling for his removal from office, stating that the president "attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president's political opponents. That is not only a violation of the Constitution; more importantly, it is profoundly immoral." On December 21, conservative Bill Kristol and a group calling itself "Republicans for the Rule of Law" released an ad encouraging viewers to call their senators to demand top Trump officials be forced to testify in his impeachment trial.  State of the Union speeches are major events here at home, but they don't happen in a vacuum. People around the world are tuned in -- especially in a Trumpian era of grandiose and often insulting language. It's unusual for presidents to say anything other than the "State of our Union is strong" -- it's politically dangerous and makes the country look vulnerable. However, the stakes this year are different.
