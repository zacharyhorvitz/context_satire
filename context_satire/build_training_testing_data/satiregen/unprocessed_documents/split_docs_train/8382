Romney accepted an invitation to address the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) on July 11, 2012. On the issue of creating jobs, Romney said, "If our goal is jobs, we have to stop spending over a trillion dollars more than we take in every year. So to do that, I'm going to eliminate every non-essential, expensive program I can find. That includes Obamacare, and I'm going to work to reform and save --" Romney was cut off by prolonged boos from those in attendance.  By Cindy Y. Rodriguez, CNN (CNN) -- The presidential candidates discussed immigration at the Univision forum a month ago, but Tuesday night’s debate gave the hot button issues a major prime-time stage, and it wasn't pretty. Five things we learned from the debate In one of the most tweeted moments, the candidates addressed audience member Lorraine Osorio's question: "Mr. Romney, what do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green cards (who) are currently living here as productive members of society?" The candidates had trouble with Osorio's name, and people went wild on social media. Why can no one get this poor woman's name right?!  This morning on "Starting Point with Soledad O'Brien," Obama Campaign senior advisor David Axelrod previews the vice presidential debates, saying that Vice President Joe Biden is looking forward to it and the pressure will be on Rep. Ryan to explain details. “One feature of this debate that will be interesting is a few weeks a go, Soledad, Congressman Ryan was on television and when he was asked to explain how they’re going to pay for this $5 trillion tax cut for the wealthy, he said, "Well, it’s too complicated in this short period of time." Well, now he has 90 minutes to do it so perhaps he’ll use his time that way,” Axelrod says. Soledad also asks about Romney’s proposed tax cut, and asks why Democrats continue to refer to it as a “$5 trillion tax cut for the wealthy” even though some analysts say it's not true.
