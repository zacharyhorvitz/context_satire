 In the moments before his death, American James Foley stares into the camera, head held high, after being forced to read a script, in which he blames his death on the United States. A masked man wielding a knife then decapitates him. As horrifying as Foley's last moments were, it was not the first time Foley looked death in the face at the hands of ISIS. A new report from The New York Times states that Foley and other ISIS captives were threatened with execution, tortured and starved ahead of their beheadings. New York is a state located in the Northeastern United States. New York was one of the original thirteen colonies that formed the United States. With an estimated 19.45 million residents in 2019, it is the fourth most populous state. In order to distinguish the state from its city with the same name, it is sometimes referred to as New York State (NYS).  The feds are suing New York City for Medicaid fraud. The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan announced a lawsuit against the city and a contractor, Computer Sciences Corp., for allegedly orchestrating a multi-million dollar billing fraud scheme that lasted about four years. The city and the company are accused of filing tens of thousands of "false claims" to Medicaid, allowing them "improperly to obtain millions of dollars of Medicaid reimbursements." Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, is accusing the city and the company of using computer programs to automatically alter billing data for Medicaid patients.
