In a subtle allegory, as his first wife Mary I of England, she represents the Low Countries, therefore belonging to the crown of Spain, which place their riches at the king's disposal in exchange for the latter's just and wise rule. The Queen of Sheba is a tall, red-haired monarch, like the Protestant Queen Elizabeth, who had recently ascended the English throne on the death of her sister Mary. In the words of the Old Testament, after the Queen had witnessed Solomon's glory, there was no more spirit in her. And so Mary wears her Pearl, and her matron's cap. In the Quran, the story essentially follows the Bible and other Jewish sources. Solomon commanded the Queen of Sheba to come to him as a subject, whereupon she appeared before him (an-Naml, 30â€“31, 45). Before the queen had arrived, Solomon had moved her throne to his place with the help of one of his men who had knowledge from the scripture(Quran 27:40). She recognized the throne, which had been disguised, and finally accepted the faith of Solomon. Based on the Gospels of Matthew (12:42) and Luke (11:31), the "queen of the South" is claimed to be the queen of Ethiopia. In those times, King Solomon sought merchants from all over the world, in order to buy materials for the building of the Temple. Among them was Tamrin, great merchant of Queen Makeda of Ethiopia. Having returned to Ethiopia, Tamrin told the queen of the wonderful things he had seen in Jerusalem, and of Solomon's wisdom and generosity, whereupon she decided to visit Solomon.
