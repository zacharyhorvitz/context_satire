Shortly after, Alice and Tasha decide they can no longer be together. During Tasha's separation board for homosexual conduct, Alice testifies in front of Colonel Gillian Davis and makes a statement about being outed that caused Davis to back off on trying to get Tasha discharged. However, Tasha decided that she no longer wanted to serve in the Army if she cannot be with the person she loves and admits to the board that she is indeed in love with Alice, effectively outing herself and resulting in her discharge. When Tasha does not immediately contact her, Alice assumes that she has chosen Jamie. She attends Bette and Tina's going away party, as they are moving to New York, and tells her friends that she has decided to make peace with Jenny for Shane's sake. However, it is Alice who first alerts the party guests to the discovery of Jenny's body in Bette and Tina's pool. Tasha arrives at the party and comforts Alice, having ultimately chosen her over Jaime. Alice briefly dates Lisa. She soon decides that her true feelings lie with Dana Fairbanks, who does not love her back and who was then engaged to her fiance Tanya. Shortly after Dana and Tanya announce their engagement, Alice visits Dana and impulsively kisses her; taking advantage of Alice's feelings, Dana kisses her back and begins an affair with her behind Tanya's back, and with Alice's pushing, Dana eventually splits up with Tanya (made easier when Tanya casually admits she had been cheating on Dana as well, implying that Tanya was only interested in Dana for her money). Though the two seem happy in their relationship, Dana's ex, Lara, comes back at the end of the second season, raising Alice's suspicions, particularly when Dana shows surprise at Alice's suggestion that they live together and refuses to say she loves her.
