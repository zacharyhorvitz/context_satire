Webb relaunched Dragnet in 1966, with NBC once again chosen to air the series. He tried to persuade Ben Alexander to rejoin him as Frank Smith. Alexander was then committed to an ABC police series, Felony Squad, and the producers would not release him. Webb reluctantly came up with a new character to take the role of Joe Friday's partner, calling upon his longtime friend Harry Morgan to play Officer Bill Gannon. In a review in Locus, Gary K. Wolfe wrote that while stories blending science fiction and fantasy are often about science versus magic, and their outcome is generally predictable, All the Birds in the Sky "is one of the most surprising novels Iâ€™ve read this year", and on the whole, "one of the most delightful". He said Anders pulls it off with "something as simple as tone". The first part is "an absolutely terrific YA novel", achieved by "masterful, wacky, and sometimes hilarious control of tone"; later it "gets a bit wobbly from time to time" as the story moves from "fixing a relationship to fixing the world", but at this point "Anders has pretty much sold us on the sheer likeability of her flawed characters". Writing on the British Fantasy Society website, Richard Webb found the book's plot generally "well-paced and compelling", and commended the "beautiful imagery" in Anders' prose. Their time at school, however, does not last long and they soon become separated. Patricia runs away after being accused of witchcraft, and with the help of a bird, becomes one and flies away; she is intercepted by a magician who enrolls her in a school for witches. Laurence is sent to a military reform school by his parents for his non-conforming behavior.
