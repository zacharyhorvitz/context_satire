 The frenetic pace of presidential campaigning that has crested in the last few days -- in which the candidates or their surrogates hit 10 states -- won't end when voters go to the polls on Tuesday. Republican candidate Mitt Romney will campaign in two states on Election Day - Ohio and Pennsylvania - according to a Romney campaign official. Campaigning on Election Day, a senior Romney adviser says, will help "keep the energy going" until the polls close. The idea is that the campaign is "just going to keep working up until the polls close," said the same Romney adviser. Romney's speech represented an unprecedented attack by a major U.S. party's most recent presidential nominee against the party's current front-runner for the nomination. Trump dismissed the comments, criticizing Romney for his losses in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections and for "working with the establishment." Two months after the speech, Trump secured the Republican Party's presidential nomination and subsequently won the general election and became the President of the United States.  On the eve of the presidential election, Mitt Romney and President Obama both made their emotional final appeals to voters. Speaking in Des Moines, Michelle Obama delivered a passionate speech about the race and the president appeared to wipe away tears at what will be his final campaign event. On Starting Point this morning, Obama campaign surrogateÂ Rep. Jim Clyburn discusses the emotional side of political campaigns and weighs in on how Hurricane Sandy may influence the election results. "Obama did a tremendous job reaching out to the other side time and time again," Clyburn says.
