 The Washington Monument, one of D.C.'s most iconic landmarks, reopens to visitors on September 19 after several years of construction and repairs. A tall, white obelisk named for the United States' first President, the monument is one of the most dramatic features of the Washington skyline and one of the most popular attractions on the National Mall. However, like so many historic sites, the 555-foot-tall monument has needed TLC over the years. In 2011, a 5.8-magnitude earthquake centered in Virginia damaged the obelisk, causing some 150 cracks in the structure.  Last December, six families penned an impassioned open letter to the world pleading for assistance in securing the release of their loved ones unjustly detained in Iran. Many of these families are still waiting for the world to heed their call for the safe return of their fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters. This week, as world leaders gather at the United Nations General Assembly, they must use this opportunity to bring up their cases with Iranian officials and call for their immediate release. For many years, Republicans and Democrats in Congress have joined together in bipartisan calls for the return of these Americans and others. George Washington (February 22, 1732 â€“ December 14, 1799) was an American political leader, military general, statesman, and Founding Father who served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. Previously, he led Patriot forces to victory in the nation's War for Independence. He presided at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which established the U.S. Constitutionand a federal government. Washington has been called the "Father of His Country" for his manifold leadership in the formative days of the new nation.
