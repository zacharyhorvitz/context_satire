The 2016 Democratic Party presidential debates pitted candidates in the race for the Democratic Party's nomination for the President of the United States. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates. Critics alleged that the small number of debates and the schedule, with half of the debates on Saturday or Sunday nights, were part of the DNC's deliberate attempt to protect the front-runner, Hillary Clinton. In February 2016 Clinton's and Sanders's campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more debates for a total of ten.  In a speech rallying Jewish supporters in Miami on Sunday afternoon, Michael Bloomberg took a jab at the other Jewish candidate in the 2020 race for the Democratic presidential nomination -- Sen. Bernie Sanders. "Now, I know I'm not the only Jewish candidate running for president. But I am the only one who doesn't want to turn America into a kibbutz," Bloomberg said near the top of his remarks at the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center and Tauber Academy Social Hall, avoiding the use of Sanders' name. Sanders spent time in Israel during the 1960s as a volunteer on a kibbutz, which is a communal farm, and calls himself a democratic socialist. After the final primary election, Clinton became the presumptive Democratic nominee. On July 12 Sanders formally endorsed Clinton, and he continued to work with the Democratic National Convention organizers to implement the progressive positions for which he had campaigned. He spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 25, during which he gave Clinton his full support. Some of his supporters attempted to protest Clinton's nomination and booed when Sanders called for party unity.
