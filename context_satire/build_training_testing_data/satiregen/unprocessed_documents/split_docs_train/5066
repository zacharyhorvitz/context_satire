 A county official urged visitors not to be deterred by dramatic images of the eruption of Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano, as only a small part of the state is affected. Kilauea volcano has gobbled up lush landscape, destroyed houses and caused nearly 2,000 people to flee their homes. It's also wreaking havoc on Hawaii's famed tourism industry to an estimated tune of millions of dollars in the first week after the May 3 eruption. At a Monday night briefing, Hawaii County Managing Director Wil Okabe called on reporters to help minimize the economic fallout by getting their geography straight when they describe the affected and putting it in the proper context.  After an eruption from the Kilauea volcano's summit shot ash and smoke 30,000 feet into the air on Thursday, officials handed out almost 18,000 masks to help residents deal with the fallout. Rain kept the ash from going very far, and the ashfall was light, but officials still warned people in the area on Hawaii's Big Island to stay indoors and to use the masks. US Geological Survey geologist Michelle Coombs described the event as "energetic, but short-lived" and said most of the debris ejected from the crater likely fell near the explosion site. Officials expect volcanic activity to continue, citing a similar series of events in 1924 that lasted 2Â½ weeks.  A week after the Kilauea volcano erupted, the future of thousands of people in Hawaii's Big Island remains uncertain. The threat of violent explosions has prompted authorities to close the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park beginning Friday and "until further notice," according to the National Park Service. The volcanic vents on the ground that released slow-moving lava and toxic gas into island communities are still a hazard. No lava was reported from any of the 15 vents but "additional outbreaks of lava are likely," the US Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said.
