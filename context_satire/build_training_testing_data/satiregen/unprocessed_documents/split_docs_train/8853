 President Barack Obama officially begins his second term today, a day ahead of his public swearing in and all the pomp and ceremony of a U.S. presidential inauguration. Because the Constitution calls for the president to be sworn in on January 20, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will be sworn in for their second terms in relatively quiet ceremonies before they take their public oaths in front of the Capitol on Monday and before an audience spread down the National Mall. Obama's Monday address will lay out the values and vision for his second term and acknowledge the division in Washington but won't address policy, a source with knowledge of the speech told CNN on the condition of anonymity. He'll lay out policy in his February 12 State of the Union address, the source said.  There is no constitutional requirement that the Supreme Court preside over the inaugural - it's just been that way and a little history was made around that on Sunday. Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the oath at the White House to President Barack Obama for a second term. Just prior, Justice Sonia Sotomayor swore in Joe Biden to another four years as vice president, becoming the first Latina jurist to administer an inaugural oath. Biden was instrumental in Sotomayor's vetting and ultimate selection by Obama for the high court and said it was an "incredible honor" for him to have her deliver the oath.  President Barack Obama got a second term from voters and another chance with Chief Justice John Roberts. After flubbing the oath in 2009, Obama and the Supreme Court's top jurist performed the honor flawlessly at the White House on Sunday at the official swearing in for the Democrat's second term. They will do it again on Monday at the Capitol before a crowd of up to 800,000 people. The Constitution mandates that U.S. presidents be sworn in on January 20.
