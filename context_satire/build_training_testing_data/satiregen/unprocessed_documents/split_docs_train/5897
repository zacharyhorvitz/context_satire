Asics (アシックス, Ashikkusu) is a Japanese multinational corporation which produces footwear and sports equipment designed for a wide range of sports, generally in the upper price range. The name is an acronym for the Latin phrase anima sana in corpore sano, which translates as "Healthy soul in a healthy body". In recent years their running shoes have often been ranked among the top performance footwear in the market. By 1971, the relationship between BRS and Onitsuka Tiger came to an end. BRS prepared to launch its own line of footwear, which was rebranded as Nike, and would bear the Swoosh newly designed by Carolyn Davidson. The Swoosh was first used by Nike on June 18, 1971, and was registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on January 22, 1974. The Nike Cortez is the first track shoe released by Nike, in 1971, and is therefore thought to be a significant aspect to the success of Nike, Inc. The Nike Cortez was first designed by Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman. Bowerman, an Olympic-class track coach, felt that athletes needed a comfortable and durable running shoe designed for distance training and road running. The Nike Cortez was released at the peak of the 1972 Olympics, which is why it gained rapid exponential interest by the general public.
