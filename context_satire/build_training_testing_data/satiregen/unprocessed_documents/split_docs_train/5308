In June 2016, it was announced that Gibson had begun work on a sequel to The Passion of the Christ focused on the resurrection of Jesus. Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay for Braveheart (1995) was also penned as screenwriter. In September, Gibson expressed his interest in directing it. He estimated that the film would be released in a few years, as it is a big project. On January 22, Noonan noted that she and Dreher had discovered the emails were sent by "an email server in the Vatican's domain" from an Vatican computer with the same IP address. The Los Angeles Times reported when they asked on December 19 when the story first broke if the "It is as it was" quote was reliable, Navarro-Valls had responded, "I think you can consider that quote as accurate." In an interview with CNN on January 21, Vatican analyst John L. Allen Jr. noted that while Dziwisz stated that Pope John Paul II made no declaration about this movie, other Vatican officials were "continuing to insist" the pope did say it, while other sources claimed they had heard Dziwisz say the pope said it on other occasions, and Allen called the situation "kind of a mess". A representative from Gibson's Icon Productions expressed surprise at Dziwisz's statements after the correspondence and conversations between film representatives and the pope's official spokesperson, Navarro-Valls, and stated "there is no reason to believe that the pope's support of the film 'isn't as it was.'" In The Passion: Photography from the Movie "The Passion of the Christ", director Mel Gibson says, "This is a movie about love, hope, faith and forgiveness. Jesus died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts.
