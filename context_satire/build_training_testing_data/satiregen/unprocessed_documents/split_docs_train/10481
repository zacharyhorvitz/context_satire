Regarding lead actress Keira Knightley, director Saul Dibb said The Duchess was "a chance to take a character from late childhood – she's married at 17 – into full adulthood, 10 years later." It was also a chance for Knightley to work with Ralph Fiennes, whom she regarded as one of her most accomplished co-stars to date; Dibb said, "When I said, 'We've got Ralph interested in playing the Duke', we both took a gulp and went, 'F---.' ... But I didn't for one second feel that she wasn't up to the task." Hayes struggled to find work after Rainbow was cancelled by ITV when the production company, Thames Television, lost its franchise in the early 1990s. He took a job stacking shelves for his local Sainsbury's grocery for four months as he had not yet found an acting job and his wife wanted him to earn an income. He spent time as a taxicab driver and then retired some time later. He stated he would like to have done serious acting work after Rainbow but "directors could only think of me as Rainbow's Geoffrey". During a series of interviews to promote his film Sing Street in 2016, Carney repeatedly criticized Knightley's performance and comportment while making Begin Again. When asked about the critical reaction to Sing Street by The Independent, Carney responded unprompted that "it's a small personal movie with no Keira Knightleys in it. It's really rewarding." In the same interview, Carney also referred to her repeatedly as a model, despite the fact that Knightley had been working professionally as an actress since childhood, saying "I'll never make a film with supermodels again."
