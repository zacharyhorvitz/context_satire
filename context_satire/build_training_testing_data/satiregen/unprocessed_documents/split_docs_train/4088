 A once unthinkable idea is now the Republican Party's new political reality: Donald Trump is its presumptive presidential nominee. Ted Cruz's sudden exit from the 2016 race Tuesday night following a devastating loss in Indiana all but brought to a halt the hard-fough battle for the GOP nomination, virtually ensuring Trump will garner the 1,237 delegates needed before the Republican convention this summer. Now, a party fractured by more than a year of campaigning, personal insults and threats of third-party runs has to figure out how to move forward. Nightcap: Donald Trump is now the presumptive GOP nominee | Sign up From congressional leaders to top donors to veteran strategists, the GOP establishment has been deeply skeptical of Trump's candidacy and motives.  Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee following a decisive victory in the Indiana primary and the decision by Ted Cruz to drop out of the race. Though Trump has not formally secured the 1,237 delegates he needs to win the nomination -- and likely won't until June -- there is no serious opposition left to block his path. His victory amounts to a stunning takeover of the Republican Party by a candidate with no political experience. Along the way, he eviscerated the GOP's most accomplished presidential field in a generation and captured the Zeitgeist of a party in which grass roots voters harbor deep ill will toward establishment elites.  Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump hasn't always considered himself a Republican. A deep dive into the CNN archives highlights Trump's political dexterity over nearly three decades. To be fair, he has been on the GOP track for the bulk of that time. In the late 1980s, during sit-down interviews with CNN's Larry King, Trump declared himself a Republican.
