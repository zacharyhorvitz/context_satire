In 2003, President of Creighton Prep, Reverend Robert Hotz resigned following an incident where he invited an openly gay alumni to speak on his experiences pertaining both religion, service, and homosexuality. The speaker, Don Fraynd, was an alumnus of the school (class of 1990) and had taught at Creighton Prep for 6 years. Rev. Hotz's resignation occurred days after the presentation, and was followed by the Creighton Prep School board's statement, describing the situation as an "incident in what we felt was a lack of correct judgment." In a match on July 19, 1859, the Niagaras were being heavily outscored by the Star Club of Brooklyn. Creighton, who had thus far been used by the team primarily in the infield, was brought on as a substitute pitcher. Using what observers described as a "low, swift delivery," Creighton achieved uncommonly swift velocity. With the balls "rising from the ground past the shoulder to the catcher," the Star batsmen were unable to hit them effectively. The Jays bounced back to defeat Long Beach State 13–4 in an elimination game, to set up a rematch with Wichita State in the National Semifinals. A trip to the title game for Creighton was not to be, however, as Wichita State advanced to the National Championship game after defeating Creighton for the eighth time that season, 11–3.
