Shortly after Leslie successfully relaunches the Pawnee harvest festival, she struggles to find any new ideas for future parks project. She becomes so stressed that Ron, in the episode "Camping," locks her in a room and refuses to let her out until she gets some sleep. She awakens the next day refreshed and full of ideas. Ron attends Andy and April's wedding in "Andy and April's Fancy Party," where he has the first dance with April. Despite Ron being a very private person, including getting his birthdate redacted from all public documents, his background does occasionally come up. He was born in a small town to Tamara "Tammy" Swanson and a father unnamed in the series. He grew up on a farm in a small town and is shown to have enjoyed woodworking from an early age, building his first chair at age 5. Ron is opposed to child labor laws, stating he got his first job at a sheet metal factory at age 9 and, in two weeks, was running the floor. Eventually when Swanson was 14, his adoptive parents divorced and he returned to his mother who at the time had recovered from the addiction. Swanson then attended Cathedral City High School, along with future boxer Timothy Bradley. At the time, Swanson associated himself with local gangs and participated in many streets fights. He also drank alcohol and took recreational drugs.
