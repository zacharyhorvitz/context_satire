 For one night, Mike Pence put a calmer, gentler face on the 2016 Republican ticket. And Tim Kaine's pestering style helped him do it. But the Indiana governor's big night in Tuesday's vice presidential debate might not transfer to his running mate, Donald Trump. Kaine -- Hillary Clinton's number two -- spent his night throwing all of Trump's most politically damaging lines at Pence and asking him to explain them.  "Some calm, something peaceful." That is what Rob Chapman is hoping will come out of the vice presidential debate being held in his hometown of Farmville, Virginia. "I think they have a better disposition, they should be able to get along," Chapman, the 45-year-old manager of Walker's Diner on North Main Street, says of vice presidential nominees Mike Pence and Tim Kaine. After the fireworks Americans saw in the general election's first presidential debate, many expect the vice presidential debate to be a more sober affair -- free of name calling, shimmies, or, hopefully, audio issues.  Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said Wednesday he apologized to his staff for breaking the "cardinal rule." "I danced in public," the Democrat said during an appearance on CNN's "New Day." The always enthusiastic McAuliffe did a bit of a jig on Tuesday at a rally in Virginia with Tim Kaine, the state's junior US senator and Hillary Clinton's running mate.
