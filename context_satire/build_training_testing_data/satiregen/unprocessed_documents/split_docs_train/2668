 In an extended shutdown, most of the federal workforce would go without pay, but the checks will keep coming to the 533 current members of Congress. Who gets paid in a shutdown and who doesn't? "That is disgraceful in my view," said freshman Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, told CNN. "Basically the only people who get paid in a shutdown are members of Congress, and that is irresponsible."  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told Congress Tuesday that the U.S. government has started to use the last of its "extraordinary measures" to ensure it stays below the debt ceiling. Now that those steps are underway, it won't be long before the country can no longer pay all its bills in full. "There are no other legal and prudent options to extend the nation's borrowing authority," Lew wrote. The Treasury Department "continues to believe" that it will run out of extraordinary measures no later than Oct. 17, he added.  Government shutdowns are very, very confusing. Among the hardest-to-grasp and most vital questions: Which federal employees will get paid and which won't. And for those who will get paid, when will they see their paychecks? "It's messy," said William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center who served for 14 years as the Senate Budget Committee's staff director.
