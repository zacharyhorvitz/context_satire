  The United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union, CNN predicts. Results show the Leave campaign has won with more than 51% of the vote. The United Kingdom stands on the precipice of a historic move to leave the European Union as a neck-and-neck race appears to have turned in favor of a "leave" vote. ITV News, a CNN affiliate, and the BBC have called the referendum for "Leave" to win.  The British pound crashed to its lowest levels in 31 years as the country voted to leave the European Union in a historic referendum. The pound dropped as low as $1.32 versus the U.S. dollar in overnight trading, a level not seen since 1985. It was down against all major world currencies. At the end of the London trading day on Friday, the pound was down by nearly 9% against the dollar, making this one of the biggest one-day declines on record.  Scotland will likely seek independence for a second time this decade after the historic vote for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Friday. Sturgeon's Scottish National Party was elected on a platform that vowed, in part, to revisit the independence issue -- last decided in a failed 2014 referendum -- should the country be "taken out of the EU against our will," Sturgeon said. "Scotland does now face that prospect," Sturgeon said. "It is a significant and material change in circumstances, and it is therefore a statement of the obvious that the option of a second referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table."
