Originally, Triple Cities College students finished their bachelor's degrees at Syracuse. By the 1948â€“1949 academic year, these could be completed entirely at the College. In 1950, it split from Syracuse and became incorporated into the public State University of New York (SUNY) system as Harpur College, named in honor of Robert Harpur, a colonial teacher and pioneer who settled in the Binghamton area. At the time it joined Champlain College in Plattsburgh as the only two liberal arts schools in the New York state system. The area is also sometimes called the "Greater Binghamton Area" as the city of Binghamton is the largest and most prominent of the three, with a population greater than the other two combined, and a much larger geographical area. The three incorporated areas are tightly squeezed together and can seem like a single large, albeit spread out, city. They are economically integrated, though they retain their political identities. For example, many people living in Binghamton go shopping at the Oakdale Mall in Johnson City on a regular basis, and it's very common for someone living in one city to work or go to school in one of the other two. During the Second World War, growth and corporate generosity continued as IBM, which was founded in greater Binghamton, emerged as a global technology leader. Along with Edwin Link's invention of the flight simulator in Binghamton, IBM transitioned the region to a high-tech economy. Other major manufacturers included Ansco and General Electric. Until the Cold War ended, the area never experienced an economic downfall, due in part to its defense-oriented industries.
