Halloran's religion became an issue during his campaign for a city council seat after it was revealed that he was an adherent of Theodism. On his group's website, Halloran offered the following descriptions of his beliefs: "We believe in and honor the Gods and Goddesses of the North, spirits of the land, and the memories of our ancestors" and described his group as "a cultural, religious and martial organization; dedicated to reviving the folkways of the Norman peoples of Northern Europe." Odin, Tyr and Freyr are among the deities worshipped by the group. Halloran also stated that "It is our hope to reconstruct the pre-Christian religion of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European peoples, within a cultural framework and community environment." Logan reveals that he is still alive and that the barn games occurred ten years prior. He was the man who appeared to die in the first game, but John, having decided Logan shouldn't die over an honest mistake, saved him and recruited him as his first apprentice. The bodies that were found were actually the bodies of criminals Halloran allowed to walk free, which Logan placed into the same tests that took place at Tuck's Pig Farm ten years ago. Logan also reveals that Munsen, one of the criminals Halloran let go, killed his wife. After the intended conclusion, Lionsgate ceased making Saw films, while waiting to hear a pitch that they thought made it worthwhile to resurrect the series. Jigsaw was conceived when writers Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger, who had spent two years pursuing the opportunity to write a Saw entry, proposed their vision. It became known in July 2016 that brothers Michael and Peter Spierig would direct the film. The producers Mark Burg and Oren Koules had also produced the previous entries in the Saw series.
