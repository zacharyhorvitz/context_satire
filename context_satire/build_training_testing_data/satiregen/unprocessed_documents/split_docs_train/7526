Joe Lo Truglio portrays Detective Charles Boyle, a nervous and clumsy but honest and hard-working detective. He is Jake's best friend, and almost completely idolizes him. He is divorced from his wife Eleanor, who had numerous affairs during their marriage, to the point where she has to pay alimony to him. He is also a huge, unapologetic foodie, maintaining a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email and often relishing bizarre foreign cuisine that disgusts his coworkers. His father left his family during his childhood and, as a result, he feels a strong tie to memories involving his father, such as his favorite Brooklyn pizza joint. He also initially refuses to celebrate Thanksgiving, since he associates the holiday with his father's absenteeism. He has a strong emotional tie to his muscle car, a 1967 Ford Mustang, which he bought outright on his first day as a cop and always carries a positive association for him (until he sold it to help pay for Terry's new child). He often quotes and makes references to his favorite movie, Die Hard. In the show's first season, Charles has a crush on Rosa, but he eventually gets over her when he starts dating Vivian Ludley, whom he met at Captain Holt's birthday party. They get engaged but break up after Charles refuses to move to Canada with her. He and Gina start seeing each other in season two, and their brief relationship results in his father and Gina's mother getting married. In season three, he starts dating Genevieve Mirren-Carter after he and Jake clear her name from an art thief.
