Carter and Moses pretend to comply with Colton, and shoot their way through Colton's guards. It is later revealed that Flynn is on Colton's payroll, and is responsible for leaking Carter's and Moses' whereabouts to Colton. Moses takes a bullet in the shoulder to save Carter's life, giving Carter time enough to arrest Flynn; Moses then shoots Colton dead. Moses gives the incriminating documents on Colton to Carter, who allows him to escape. Carter miraculously survives and makes a full recovery with the aid of his physical therapist, Dr. Traci Flynn, with whom he falls in love. Moses is brought into custody, and he agrees to testify against Colton, but the trial is set to take place at the other side of the country. Carter's superior officer, Capt. Jensen, orders him to personally transfer Moses to the courtroom. Moore was born in Mount Vernon, Washington and grew up in his mother's house in Camano Island. Neighbors said they made several calls to Child Protective Services, believing he was neglected or abused. His father, Gordon Moore, used drugs and was in prison while Colton was a toddler. When Colton was twelve years old, his father walked out after an argument at a family barbecue.
