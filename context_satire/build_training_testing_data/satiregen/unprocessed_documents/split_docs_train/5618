 Donald Trump said Monday London's new mayor made "very rude statements" about him -- and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee warned he won't have a good relationship with British Prime Minister David Cameron if he's elected. Trump made the comments in an interview with ITV's "Good Morning Britain" host Piers Morgan, when asked to respond to criticisms made about him by British politicians. Trump's comments on Islam have provoked an outcry in the UK, and prompted parliamentarians to debate a proposal to ban him from the country for hate speech after a petition to do so attracted more than 500,000 signatures. In December, Cameron labeled the presidential hopeful's suggestion of a temporary ban on Muslims traveling to the U.S. as "divisive, stupid and wrong."  Actor Bryan Cranston called for greater civility in today's political discourse, referencing the 2016 presidential race, in an interview with CNN's Ashleigh Banfield Tuesday. "I want to promulgate the idea that just because someone has a different opinion than yours it does not make them the enemy," the "Breaking Bad" star said. "So I will say right here, right now, on national television that I believe Donald Trump loves this country. I truly believe that and I know he does.  An attorney for Donald Trump said Tuesday that money raised for veterans has been "distributed to worthy causes" as he defended the campaign from reports it was unable to account for all the funds promised to charities. Trump counsel Michael Cohen spoke to CNN's "New Day" to rebut reports, including by CNN, that the campaign exaggerated funds raised at a charity event for veterans last January, which Trump hosted instead of participating in a Fox News presidential debate the same night. "How sad is that? Donald Trump who goes ahead and raises -- whether it is 4, 5, 6 million, whatever the number is -- a guy who has clearly shown himself who is interested and cares very deeply for our American veterans," Cohen said.
