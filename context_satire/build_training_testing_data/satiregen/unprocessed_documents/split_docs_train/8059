 The bull market hit a speed bump this week as investors begin to consider what life will be like when the Federal Reserve starts to taper off its long-standing asset purchasing program. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all ended little changed Friday. Trading volume was light Friday, ahead of the Memorial Day Holiday. U.S. and U.K. markets will be closed Monday.  Got a question about tax refunds, polluters or subsidized housing? Don't expect an answer this Friday. That's because four federal government agencies will be closed on Friday, including the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental Protection Agency and the White House Office of Management and Budget. Employees at all four agencies will be on furlough that day.  The first sign for a truck driver that something was wrong on a bridge on Interstate 5 that collapsed into Washington's Skagit River was the sound of a "boom," a federal investigator said Saturday. At the same time, the driver felt a shudder, NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman told reporters. That's the moment, according to Hersman, the tractor-trailer hauling an oversized load Thursday struck one of the bridge's overhead trusses, causing it to collapse and sending vehicles into the river below. The latest details were released as state officials work to find a temporary solution for the bridge on the heavily traveled interstate near Mount Vernon, about 60 miles north of Seattle.
