 The GOP race is down to the final four candidates, and last night's Fox News debate showed the wear and tear of an already bruising campaign on each of them. From the opening bell until the closing round, the candidates took heavy swings at each other, sometimes connecting, more often missing in the flurried exchanges. And perhaps due to some last-minute desperation, the disagreements on stage occasionally veered from heated to embarrassing. For three of the four candidates, the sense of urgency was palpable.  Size matters. The GOP debate in Detroit Thursday night had been underway for just seven minutes when this point was made crystal clear. Republican debate turns dirty As the number of candidates still in the race has shrunk, tonight carried the promise of learning more about the remaining four. Instead, the personal insults began flying right away, most notably between Marco Rubio and Donald Trump.  Imagine if every GOP debate had been like the one Thursday night. Policy heavy, insult light and providing voters with a contrast between the candidates over level of knowledge on issues. It was clear that each candidate had shifted tactics from the last dumpster fire of a debate. After Sen. Marco Rubio's mudslinging with Donald Trump hurt his campaign, he decided to return to his above-the-fray, aspirational tone.
