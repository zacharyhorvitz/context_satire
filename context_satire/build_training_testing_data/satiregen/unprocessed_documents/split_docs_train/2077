 Natalie Dubose has no choice but to carry on, one day after rioters smashed the windows of her Ferguson bakery. "I'm baking today," Dubose told CNNMoney, as the sound of broken glass being swept up can be heard over the phone. "We have orders to go out for Thanksgiving. I can't tell the people -- I won't tell the people -- that I'm canceling."  It's the kind of anxiety you feel when a Category 5 Hurricane is hurtling your way. You can't gauge with certainty what will fall in its path, what will remain in its aftermath. You board up. And wait.  President Barack Obama called for calm Monday night, moments after a Missouri prosecutor announced there would be no indictment against the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown. His measured tone stood in stunning contrast to the images of violence on the streets of Ferguson that intensified on a split screen. As the President spoke -- warning protesters that throwing bottles and smashing car windows won't help -- some members of the crowds of hundreds in Ferguson were doing just that. Police responded by firing tear gas.
