In August 2018, Nelson issued a statement urging the use of the church's full name. At the church's General Conference in October 2018, he reiterated his position, declaring, "It is a correction" and "It is the command of the Lord." Nelson told members that the use of nicknames such as Mormon or LDS was "a major victory for Satan." In 1997, Mitchell's 15-year-old friend Angela was killed in a car accident. In the book Chicken Soup for the Preteen Soul, Mitchell described how the death deeply affected her. The 7th Heaven episode "Nothing Endures But Change" was based on her experience. Her hit song "Angel" which is featured on her debut album was also written for her late friend. On a weekend in June 2019, at a large number of Target stores in the U.S., "On Saturday ... shoppers experienced a systems outage that shut down the card readers at check-out registers for close to two hours. On Sunday, there were additional spot outages that the company says were unrelated to Saturday’s problems." Another—although much shorter—checkout register crash happened in 2013, on the same date as the Saturday crash.
