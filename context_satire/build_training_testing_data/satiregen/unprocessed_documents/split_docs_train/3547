 Forty days after he began his presidency with a dark and foreboding inaugural speech, President Donald Trump on Tuesday night spoke in broadly optimistic tones throughout his first address to a joint session of Congress. If Trump's words on January 20 bore the tone of his divisive campaign, his remarks on Capitol Hill were remarkable for just how much they resembled similar speeches from his predecessors. Opponents and critics will note that, in its substance, Trump did little to back down from his most controversial plans. But his nods to the more conventional tropes of the genre created an unlikely juxtaposition.  Twenty-five minutes before President Donald Trump was due to be introduced into the House Chamber for his first address to Congress, the speech he was set to deliver was typed, bound and in his hands for delivery. But it was the delivery the President was hung up on. Sitting in the back of his armored limousine next to his wife, rain pounding on the windows, Trump set to work practicing a few lines with the advisers he trusts most: his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and daughter, Ivanka. As the car rolled into a wet night toward Capitol Hill, Trump ran through the most important lines of his most important speech to date, looking to Kushner for approval.  President Donald Trump nailed the performance art during his first address to Congress Tuesday night. But turning his solid reviews into tangible policy victories will be a lot more complicated and test more than his showmanship. The President woke up to a rare experience Wednesday: glowing reviews in the media that he has nominated as an enemy of the American people. "THANK YOU" he tweeted, savoring a rare moment of universal praise in a young presidency battered by self-detonated controversies and the political residue of one of the most divisive elections in decades.
