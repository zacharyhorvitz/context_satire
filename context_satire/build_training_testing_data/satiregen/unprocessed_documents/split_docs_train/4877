 U.S. Army Sgt. Timothy Owens will be remembered as many things. A son, a husband, a father. A victim of Wednesday's shooting at Fort Hood, Owens loved the Army and planned to make it his career.  Authorities investigating this week's deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood said Friday that an altercation between Spc. Ivan Lopez and his fellow soldiers, rather than a medical condition, may have led to Lopez opening fire. "The immediate precipitating factor was more likely an escalating argument in his unit area," Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, the post's commanding general, told reporters. Some of the soldiers involved in the altercation were victims in the shooting, according to Chris Grey, spokesman for the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, who appeared with Milley at a news conference on the sprawling post. Twenty-five years later World War II is raging in Europe. Jerry's son Johnny enlists in the Army shortly after Pearl Harbor. He tells his sweetheart Eileen Dibble that they cannot marry until he returns, since he doesn't want to make her a widow.
