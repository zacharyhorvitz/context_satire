During the post World War II period, student enrollment expanded greatly. The original university buildings were then located in what was known as the Valley Campus. It was located geographically down the hill in lower Mankato. The size and footprint of the Valley Campus could not sustain the space needed to handle the growing student body. The RHEDC eventually identified the need for a branch campus of the University of Minnesota system that could integrate with the health sciences programs and needs of the Mayo Clinic. The group promoted the University of Minnesota system as the only higher education provider in a position to carry out this ideal, in spite of the existing branch campus of Winona State University - Rochester and Rochester Community and Technical College. The RHEDC report was drafted and delivered to the legislature and the governor. The recommendations of the report were adopted by the governor, the legislature and the University of Minnesota Board of Regents. The University of Minnesota Crookston (UMC) joined the university system in 1966. At that time it was known as the University of Minnesota Technical Institute at Crookston. Since 1993 the Crookston campus has offered bachelor's degrees, and it has grown to be a more comprehensive regional college campus. It is known for its focus on experiential learning and technology, and through fees each student is provided a laptop computer as part of their experience.
