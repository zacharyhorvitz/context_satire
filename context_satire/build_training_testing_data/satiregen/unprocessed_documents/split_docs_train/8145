 The past week has been a devastating one for many families. Zubeidat Tsarnaev's is one of them. But the mother of the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings remains resolute in her belief that her sons were not involved in the attack. She told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh in Makhachkala, Dagestan, that she believes the tragedy that killed three people and injured dozens more was staged and that the bombing was fake.  It was a boat owner's obsession with perfection, making sure his "baby" was stowed just right in his backyard, that led him to discover the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. Contrary to police reports, David Henneberry said the discovery of blood had nothing to do with the inspection of his boat, the Slip Away II, he told CNN affiliate WCVB. During the inspection, he found a bloodied Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, hiding in the boat, he said. Henneberry said he had been obsessing over how two pads had fallen out of the shrink-wrap protecting his boat for the winter.  The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings has cited the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as motivating factors behind last week's attack, a U.S. government official said Tuesday. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been able to communicate with investigators in a limited fashion from his hospital bed and told them that neither he nor his brother Tamerlan, now dead, had any contact with terrorist groups overseas. The official cautioned that the interviews were preliminary, however, and that Tsarnaev's account needs to be checked out. The 19-year-old has told investigators the brothers were self-radicalized via the Internet.
