 Future generations of Americans will be fully accustomed to a female commander in chief, President Barack Obama said Tuesday. He didn't mention former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the current Democratic presidential front-runner who has come closest to becoming the country's first female president. But he did suggest while dedicating a new national monument that the gender barrier in the White House would be broken soon. "I want young girls and boys to come here 10, 20, a hundred years from now and know that women fought for equality; it was not just given to them," he said at the newly designated Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument on Capitol Hill.  As President Barack Obama works to keep a Democrat in the White House, his public assessments of Hillary Clinton remain constrained politically and legally, a scenario that's unlikely to change anytime soon. Much of Obama's acclaim for the Democratic presidential front-runner remains couched in generic terms about her tenure as his top diplomat, broad enough to offer praise while not alienating the significant number of young people who are voting for her rival. And his replies to questions about her use of a personal email server while serving as his secretary of state remain carefully crafted as his administration investigates the set-up. It's never been a secret that most of Obama's closest allies regard Clinton as the more obvious caretaker of his legacy, much of which has been built through executive action and therefore will rely on his Oval Office replacement to maintain.  Hillary Clinton was on the subway. And New Yorkers were totally unfazed. Clinton, arguably the most famous woman in the United States, boarded the 4 train going uptown on Thursday morning, nearly at the peak of rush-hour traffic. Followed by over a dozen reporters and cameras, Clinton tried to make a chaotic situation seem normal.
