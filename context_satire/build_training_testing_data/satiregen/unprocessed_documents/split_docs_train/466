Since its founding in 1914, a secretive coalition of fraternities and sororities, commonly known as "The Machine", has wielded enormous influence over the Student Government Association. Occurrences of harassment, intimidation, and even criminal activities aimed at opposition candidates have been reported. Many figures in local, state, and national politics have come out of the SGA at the University of Alabama. Esquire devoted its April 1992 cover story to an expos√© of The Machine. Local county health departments provide information on All Kids, a low-cost health care coverage program for all eligible children under the age of 19. All Kids is the result of a partnership between The Alabama Department of Public Health, The Alabama Medicaid Agency, and the Alabama Child Caring Foundation. Alabama was the first state in the nation to have a federally approved State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plan. CHIP was added to the Social Security Act by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. At the same time, many rural people migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the "Magic City". By 1920, Birmingham was the 36th-largest city in the United States. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy.
