 ESPN's "Monday Night Football" had bears, vikings and Jedi on Monday night. The official trailer for "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" debuted during halftime of the Monday night match up between the Chicago Bears and Minnesota Vikings. The new trailer gives us our latest look at the most anticipated film of the year, which brings us back to the galaxy far, far away. It focused on the two new main characters of the series in Adam Driver's Kylo Ren and Daisy Ridley's Rey as well as old favorites like Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker and Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia. During 1966, Disney cultivated businesses willing to sponsor EPCOT. He increased his involvement in the studio's films, and was heavily involved in the story development of The Jungle Book, the live-action musical feature The Happiest Millionaire (both 1967) and the animated short Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day. The release of The Jungle Book and The Happiest Millionaire in 1967 raised the total number of feature films that Disney had been involved in to 81. When Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day was released in 1968, it earned Disney an Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category, awarded posthumously. After Disney's death, his studios continued to produce live-action films prolifically but largely abandoned animation until the late 1980s, after which there was what The New York Times describes as the "Disney Renaissance" that began with The Little Mermaid (1989). Disney's companies continue to produce successful film, television and stage entertainment.
