 Over the last year, researchers have found nearby exoplanets that could potentially support life, like Proxima b and the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets. Now, a "super-Earth" has been found 39 light-years away, according to new research in the journal Nature. Researchers believe it may be one of the best candidates for a closer look in the future by the James Webb Space Telescope, which NASA will launch in 2018. LHS 1140b, named for the small, faint red dwarf star it orbits, has all the right features.  NASA announced this week exciting results from a spacecraft observing Saturn's moon Enceladus and Jupiter's moon Europa. Equipment on the Cassini probe detected some of the required conditions and building blocks for life on both moons. For those like myself, who thrill at any discovery that suggests Earth's creatures may not be alone in the universe, the findings capture our imagination anew. But does Cassini bring our imaginings closer to reality?  Wondering how to show that special planet some affection this Earth Day?Adopt it. NASA has sectioned off 64,000 individual pieces of Earth to be "adopted" by supporters on their website. The pieces are about 55 miles wide and assigned randomly. Similar to adopting a highway or naming a star, participants do not get legal or property rights to their section.
