On January 14, 2015, it was announced that Allen would write and direct a TV series of half-hour episodes for Amazon Studios, marking the first time he has developed a television show. It was to be available exclusively on Amazon Prime Instant Video, and Amazon Studios had already ordered a full season. Allen said of the series, "I don't know how I got into this. I have no ideas and I'm not sure where to begin. On August 16, 2005, Combs announced on Today that he was altering his stage name yet again; he would be calling himself "Diddy". Combs said fans didn't know how to address him, which led to confusion. In November 2005, London-based musical artist and DJ Richard Dearlove, who had been performing under the name "Diddy" since 1992 –  nine years before Combs started using even "P. Diddy" –  sought an injunction in the High Court of Justice in London. He accepted an out-of-court settlement of £10,000 in damages and more than £100,000 in costs. Diddy performed "Come To Me" with Cassie on MTV Europe Music Awards 2006, as well as on the NBC pregame show for the opening game of the 2006 NFL season between the Miami Dolphins and the Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He has also performed the song several times with Danity Kane. Plus, he performed it three times with Nicole Scherzinger.
