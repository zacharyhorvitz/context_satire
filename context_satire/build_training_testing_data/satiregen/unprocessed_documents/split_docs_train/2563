Young originally wrote The Shack as a Christmas gift for his six children with no apparent intention of publishing it. After letting several friends read the book he was urged to publish it for the general public. In 2006, Young worked with Wayne Jacobsen, Brad Cummings (both former pastors from Los Angeles) and Bobby Downes (filmmaker) to bring the book to publication after a period of sixteen months and four rewrites. They had no success with either religious or secular publishers, so they formed Windblown Media for the purpose of publishing the book. At that week's tournament, The Tour Championship, Stewart's good friend, Stuart Appleby, organized a tribute to his friend. With Stewart's wife's permission, he wore one of Payne's own signature outfits for the final round of the tournament on Sunday, and most of the rest of the golfers in the field wore "short pants" that day, as well. The Tetra Society was founded in 1987 in Vancouver, British Columbia, by quadriplegic Sam Sullivan. He recounts feeling trapped – not by his disability but by his inaccessible surroundings: “I couldn't use the washroom, shower, cook on my own. I couldn't even turn the doorknob to get out of my own apartment! It wasn’t long before I found that I was not alone; there were many frustrated people struggling with things so basic that most people would never think twice about them.”
