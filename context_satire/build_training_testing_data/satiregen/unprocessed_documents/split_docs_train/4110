Zuckerberg built a website called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending Harvard University. The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used "photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the "hotter" person". Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours. The site was sent to several campus group list-servers, but was shut down a few days later by Harvard administration. March and Healy try to bring the matter to court but have no evidence. At Misty’s house, they discover the nearsighted Mrs. Glenn only saw projected footage of her niece — the missing film. They realize that Chet is the projectionist for the Los Angeles Auto Show and will try to screen the film. At the auto show, Healy and March are intercepted at gunpoint by Tally, who is distracted by Holly and knocked unconscious. Healy is interrogated by two thugs, “Blueface” — so named after he sets off a dye pack while searching Healy’s apartment — and Older Guy, about Amelia's whereabouts. Healy wards them off with a shotgun, and teams up with a reluctant March to find Amelia first.
