Brooks' distance from his friends and colleagues living in Washington, D.C., which he has called "the most emotionally avoidant city in America", provided a major inspiration for writing the book. He has also remarked, "Our explanation of why we live the way we do is all on the surface... Our policies have been shaped by shallow views of human nature."  Tiger Woods hasn't played since that miraculous Masters win last month but he says he is physically fresh and mentally ready to launch his quest for a 16th major title. The 43-year-old is the betting favorite for the year's second major at this week's PGA Championship at Bethpage -- moved from August to a new slot in May -- after clinching his fifth Green Jacket and first major title for 11 years after overcoming career-threatening back injuries and personal issues. Woods' comeback has electrified the sport of golf again and reignited his pursuit of Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 majors, and Bethpage's infamous Black course is a venue he knows intimately after winning the 2002 US Open on the Long Island track. "I wanted to play at Quail Hollow  but to be honest with you I wasn't prepared to start the grind again, I wasn't mentally ready to log the hours," Woods told reporters at Bethpage Tuesday. Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive behavior, such as the prevalence of teenage sex and divorce. His view is that "sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the entertainment media have become more sex-saturated, American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious" by "waiting longer to have sex ...  having fewer partners". He sees the culture war as nearly over, because "today's young people ... seem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right."
