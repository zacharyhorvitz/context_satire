Deep fried Oreos were first introduced by Charlie Boghosian, also known as "Chicken Charlie" or "The Man Who Fries Everything," a 46-year-old Armenian settled in San Diego, in 2002 at Los Angeles County Fair. "There are many other fried foods at the fair, but I specialize in it. I make it my life," Boghosian says about deep fried foods. Aside from the deep fried Oreo, he has also introduced new types of deep fried food every year in different state fairs. A deep fried Oreo is a dessert or snack consisting of an Oreo which is dipped in batter and deep-fried. It can be served with different toppings or simply with no toppings. Deep fried Oreos are generally made using the Oreo cookies by the Nabisco division of MondelÄ“z International, but also can be made of other chocolate sandwich cookies. In 2013, Kim Kardashian appeared on The Jay Leno Show and she introduced the deep fried Oreo. On the program, Kardashian cooked her deep fried Oreos with Food Network chef Guy Fieri and said of the goodies: "It's like a once-a-year snack."
