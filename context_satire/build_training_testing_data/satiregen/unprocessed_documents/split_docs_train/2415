Various spellings were used for the name they heard Native Americans use for their valley and hillside. It was an Algonquian word, shah-pah-ka, and it meant "the rustling land" or "the rattling land," or a place where nothing is heard but the rustling of the wind in the leaves. The Quakers spelled it Shapiqua, Shapaqua, Shapequa, Shappaqua, and, finally, Chappaqua. Their meeting was often referred to as the Shapequa Meeting as early as 1745. Each block represents one of the one hundred seats in the U.S. Senate. "D#" is a Democratic senator, "I#" is an Independent senator, and "R#" is a Republican senator. They are arranged so that the parties are separated and a majority is clear by crossing the middle. The school is named for Horace Greeley, the editor of The New York Tribune who made his home in Chappaqua late in life. One of the school's three main publications, The Greeley Tribune, is an additional tribute to the newsman. The school's other two main publications are The Quake, a full color, student-run sports magazine with a staff of over fifty, making it the school's largest publication, and ADVO, a full color, student-run lifestyle and entertainment magazine.
