 North Korea announced Friday that it has detained a U.S. citizen who it says entered the secretive country as a tourist in April and broke the law. The news brings the number of Americans believed to be held in the communist nation to three. The North's state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that authorities are investigating a man who it said violated the law by acting "contrary to the purpose of tourism." In a brief English-language article, KCNA gave the American's name as Jeffrey Edward Fowle, saying he arrived as a tourist on April 29.  The great American Dream is dying. Even though many Americans still desire to own a home, they are losing faith in homeownership as a key to prosperity. Nearly two-thirds of Americans, or 64%, believe they are less likely to build wealth by buying a home today than they were 20 or 30 years ago, according to a survey sponsored by non-profit MacArthur Foundation. And nearly 43% said buying a home is no longer a good long-term investment.  The American Dream is impossible to achieve in this country. So say nearly 6 in 10 people who responded to CNNMoney's American Dream Poll, conducted by ORC International. They feel the dream -- however they define it -- is out of reach. Young adults, age 18 to 34, are most likely to feel the dream is unattainable, with 63% saying it's impossible.
