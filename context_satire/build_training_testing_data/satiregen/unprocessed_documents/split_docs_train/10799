 President Barack Obama spent part of Monday hobnobbing with celebrities and other power-brokers in Southern California, continuing a West Coast trip that includes town-hall events, a meeting with Marines and fund-raisers for his re-election campaign. It was not all fund-raising, though, as the president started his day in Northern California. That included a morning stop in Mountain View for a forum at the Computer History Museum. Obama then jetted to San Diego, where he landed at the Marine Air Corps Station in Miramar. On June 4, John McCain proposed a series of ten joint town hall meetings with Obama, at which the two could engage each other. Obama first agreed in principle to the notion, but later rejected McCain's proposal, offering instead one town-hall event on the Independence Day holiday and four traditional debate-style joint appearances. Hank Paulson, President Bush's Treasury Secretary, said Obama's comprehension of the financial crisis compared to McCain's was as broad as "night and day". McCain's confidence vastly lowered when Obama questioned his ideas on the financial crisis in a meeting on September 25 at the White House with Bush and other congressmen. In February 2009, the Cullman Times, an Alabama newspaper, reported that at a town hall meeting there, U.S. Senator from Alabama Richard Shelby was asked if there was any truth to the rumors that Obama was not a natural-born citizen. According to the Times report, Shelby said, "Well his father was Kenyan and they said he was born in Hawaii, but I haven't seen any birth certificate. You have to be born in America to be president."
