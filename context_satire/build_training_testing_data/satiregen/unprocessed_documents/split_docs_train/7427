Despite being a gated community, there have been rare but occasional instances of crime. In February 2007, the Beverly Park home of Tim McGraw and Faith Hill was burglarized. Police stated that the method of entry was believed to be a broken window and an unspecified amount of money was missing. In February 2010, resident Lisa Vanderpump's automobile was stolen from her driveway during the night and driven off a nearby cliff. Crestwood Hills began as a utopian experiment in the late 1940s by a few musicians, and eventually turned into a cooperative association that included 400 members. The project was initially called the Mutual Housing Tract, before changing to Crestwood Hills. It was intended as a multi-ethnic project, but pressure on the landowner from existing Brentwood residents - this was still the era of racially and religiously restrictive housing covenants - eventually led to some members of the original group to being dropped as a condition of finalizing the sale. The 1961 Brentwood-Bel-Air fire lead to the destruction of 49 homes. In May 2008, residents of South Beverly Park sued the North Beverly Park Homeowners Association over access to the north's two gates at Mulholland Drive after access was restricted in 2007. Residents of South Beverly Park could use the gate, but visitors were forced to use the south's gates, which, due to the location of the neighborhood, could require a detour of up to seven miles (11Â km). The dispute arose in March 2006 when the north's Homeowners Association sent the south's homeowners a letter demanding that they "pay their fair share of costs we  are incurring for maintenance of the roads, gates, and security" for an amount specified at $121,000 a year. The south's residents rejected the demand, and a series of legal correspondence followed that resulted in the north's raising the amount it sought to $128,000.
