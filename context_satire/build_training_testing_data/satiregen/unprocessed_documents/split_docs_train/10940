In 1965 Allen filmed a half-hour comedy special in Great Britain for Granada Television, The Woody Allen Show. It is the only complete standup show of Allen's on film. In 1967 Allen hosted a TV special for NBC, Woody Allen Looks at 1967. It featured Liza Minnelli, who acted alongside Allen in some skits; Aretha Franklin, the musical guest; and conservative writer William F. Buckley, the featured guest. His show "Jammin" was picked up as "Kickin' It with Byron Allen" in 1992, and by the end of its run had made the list of longest-running United States television series. Allen's foray into television production began in Los Angeles in 1993 when he founded Entertainment Studios with the launch of his first series — Entertainers with Byron Allen—a weekly, one-hour series profiling the current stars of film and television. Comedian Jimmie Walker saw Allen's stand-up act and invited the 14-year-old comedian to join his comedy writing team alongside promising young comedians Jay Leno and David Letterman. At age 18, Allen made his television debut on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. One of his earliest roles was as a regular presenter on the NBC series Real People during the show's entire run.
