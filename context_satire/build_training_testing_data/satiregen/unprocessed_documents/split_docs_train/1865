 For one night, Mike Pence put a calmer, gentler face on the 2016 Republican ticket. And Tim Kaine's pestering style helped him do it. But the Indiana governor's big night in Tuesday's vice presidential debate might not transfer to his running mate, Donald Trump. Kaine -- Hillary Clinton's number two -- spent his night throwing all of Trump's most politically damaging lines at Pence and asking him to explain them.  Donald Trump and Mike Pence are a study in contrasts when it comes to their debate preparation. As the vice presidential candidates prepare to take the stage for a televised debate this Tuesday, a campaign official said GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence has been preparing for Tuesday's debate since the day the Indiana governor received the call to join the Republican ticket in July. Pence's debate preparations contrast sharply with the much looser sessions used by Trump in the weeks running up to his first face-off with Hillary Clinton. Trump never practiced against a stand-in for Clinton.  As one of Donald Trump's earliest and strongest backers on Capitol Hill, Jeff Sessions knows a thing or two about defending the Republican nominee. So does the Alabama senator think Mike Pence failed Trump on that front at the vice presidential debate? Not at all. "What Pence did and why he won this debate was he refused to be distracted," Sessions said Wednesday morning on CNN's "New Day."
