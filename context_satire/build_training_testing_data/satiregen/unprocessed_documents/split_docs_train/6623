Appleton North High School is a comprehensive secondary school in Appleton, Wisconsin that is part of the Appleton Area School District. Opened in August 1995, it is the most recently built of the three four-year public high schools in the district. The school has 1,780 students. The school colors are gold, silver and navy blue. At the start of the 2001â€“02 season, Appleton was a regular in the first team, but on 19 November 2001, Appleton tore posterior cruciate ligaments in his right knee, after an accidental training ground collision with teammate Des Lyttle. He was initially expected to be out for the rest of the season. With West Brom getting promoted to the Premier League, Appleton had to wait until February 2003 for his return to football, 28 minutes into a reserve team match against former club Manchester United. In November 2003, at the age of 27, Appleton was forced to retire, after losing his two-year battle against injury.
