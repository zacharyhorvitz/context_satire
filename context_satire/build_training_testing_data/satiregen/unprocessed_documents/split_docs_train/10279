 Finally, after days of listing on a disabled Carnival cruise ship without electricity and working toilets, thousands of passengers finished disembarking early Friday morning at the Port of Mobile. The frustration that many felt was typified by Janie Esparza, one of the first passengers to get back on land. "It was horrible. Horrible," Esparza told a scrum of reporters.  Much-needed supplies and a third tugboat are heading across the Gulf of Mexico to try to make the end of the miserable voyage of the Carnival Triumph as comfortable as possible for hungry travelers who have waited in lines for hours for food and other necessities. Carnival Cruise Lines said Wednesday afternoon it has dispatched another tugboat to help two others tow the disabled and befouled cruise ship to port in Mobile, Alabama, with U.S. Coast Guard escorts on the scene. The cruise line also said it would compensate passengers $500 each in addition to measures previously announced, including refunds. Carnival said on its Facebook page that it decided against sending another ship to pick up passengers because towing the ship to port was the safest option. Normal daily life comes to a stop for about a week in the southern part of the Netherlands during the carnival, with roads temporary blocked and many local businesses closed for the week as a result of employees who are en masse taking the days off during and the day after the carnival.
