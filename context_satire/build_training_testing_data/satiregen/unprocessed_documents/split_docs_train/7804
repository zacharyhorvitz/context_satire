 The war of words over "thoughts and prayers" in response to the San Bernardino massacre is the latest illustration that our culture is fractured not only politically, but also along the transcendence line: The line divides those who believe in a God who intervenes in the world and those who do not. We see the transcendence line in sharp relief when some people are moved to pray in response to tragedy and others insist that prayer doesn't "work" and isn't "doing" anything. We see it in the puzzled and impatient reactions to the acts of forgiveness extended by the family members of those killed in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. We see it in critiques of Christian missionaries who care for the sick and dying in Ebola-stricken lands.  I feel grateful to President Barack Obama, who has urged a calm, steady, yet vigorous approach to the threat from radical Islam that has, in the wake of San Bernadino, come to our shores again. As he implied in his speech to the nation Sunday night, it's easy to overreact to terror, which makes us feel, well, terrified. But the facts on the ground, so far, don't support the notion that we have been facing a great deal of active terrorism in this country. As New America has pointed out, there have been just 45 deaths in the United States from jihadist terror since 9/11.  Put away the adrenaline and testosterone. In the six days and five nights we were in northeast Syria we heard not a single shot fired, nor saw a single bomb drop. The flak jackets and helmets we brought with us never left their bags. We went to a variety of places in northeastern Syria.
