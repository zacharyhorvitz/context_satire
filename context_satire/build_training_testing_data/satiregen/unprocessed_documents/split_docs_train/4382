In "Payback", he gets the name of the witness, Ruben, from the Bingham investigation. In his own car, he sees the witness and an unknown man in what appears to be a transaction. He waits for the witness to leave, then goes to the second person involved. It turns out that Ruben was paying off his debt. In "Fathers and Sons", while Ruzek working undercover in an investigation of a drug dealing ring that involves the brutal death of a young drug mule, he finds out that his father, Disco Bob, is also involved. So the next morning he visits his father's house for a meeting of the minds. Bob says he's just “getting paid” and there's nothing else his son needs to know about, but wants his name kept out of the report. Upon this discovery, Upton demands that he either tells Voight about his father's involvement or she will. In Season 2, Voight learns that he is going to be a grandfather when he meets Olive, who got pregnant by Justin before he enlisted. In "An Honest Woman", Voight was beaten and kidnapped, along with Olive, by two criminals, and was threatened by them to open the safe he has in his basement by killing Olive. It was revealed that earlier, she had run her mouth to an old friend of hers and confessed that Justin had told her about his father's secret stash. Then later, her friend went behind her back and betrayed her.
