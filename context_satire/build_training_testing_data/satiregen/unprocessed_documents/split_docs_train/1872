It was built in 1911 and was designed by Minot architects Woodruff & McGulpin in Classical Revival style. It has also been known as Free Public Library, Carnegie Library and Minot Public Library. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It served as the public library for Minot from 1912 until 1965, until the new Minot Public Library building was built. The 90th Academy Awards in 2018 had the lowest Nielsen ratings of all time, with less than half of the 57.25 million viewers of the 70th in 1998. In October 2018, the Academy asked Dwayne Johnson to host the 91st ceremony, believing that the popularity of Hollywood's highest-paid actor would help increase the audience. Johnson immediately began planning what he described as an "audience first" show, but could not change his schedule of filming Hobbs & Shaw and Jumanji: The Next Level. The next day, outside the town hall, Jack announces his new comic book series to a crowd which he calls "Super Buddies" and his new partner, Bartleby Livingston. He reads the comic out loud to the audience. The film ends with a picture, from one of the new comics, of the Super Buddies standing on a building, ready for action.
