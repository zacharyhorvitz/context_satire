After a year-long vacation from acting, she returned to her role on The Young and the Restless in March 1999. After a successful return as Ashley Abbott, which included Davidson's second Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress, Davidson was fired from the show. In December 2006, Davidson told TV Guide that she was fired from The Young and the Restless due to lack of storyline. Her last airdate as Ashley was January 11, 2007. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn demanded an apology from Davidson in March, 2019, after an SNL sketch in which he compared the Catholic Church to R. Kelly, an entertainer who had been accused of pedophilia. In the sketch, Davidson said "(Kelly) is a monster and he should go to jail forever. But if you support the Catholic Church, isn't that like the same thing as being an R. Kelly fan? I don't really see the difference, except for one's music is significantly better." Davidson appeared as captain of The Young and the Restless team when they played for charity on Family Feud several times from 1989 until 1993. Through connections he made during those appearances, Davidson eventually got a position hosting a five-night-a-week, syndicated, half-hour version of the game show The New Price Is Right, beginning on September 12, 1994. The show was canceled just four and a half months later on January 27, 1995. Davidson was one of a few people given an audition to replace Bob Barker after his retirement from The Price Is Right in June 15, 2007, a role which ultimately went to Drew Carey.
