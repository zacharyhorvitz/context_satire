Hyde violated a restraining order issued by a judge in Washington, D.C., ordering him to stay away from a female Republican political consultant who said Hyde was stalking her, leading police to confiscate three rifles and two shotguns from him. Kurt Hyde of The New American called the film "a mixed bag", stating that, among other reasons, although "parts of the movie were well-researched, the accounts of numerous other events, especially those more than 100 years in the past could have been researched more thoroughly" and that "here isn't any great difference between the two parties", contrary to what the film claimed. After graduating from Gustavus Adolphus in 1989, Elling enrolled in graduate school at the University of Chicago Divinity School where he studied for his master's degree in philosophy of religion. He thought about continuing work in academia or working for the World Council of Churches when he graduated. He began playing jazz gigs once a week during graduate school, with one of his first shows at Milt Trenier's, a basement club in Chicago (now defunct). He earned little money at these gigs, but Karl Johnson, the house pianist, was his mentor and teacher.
