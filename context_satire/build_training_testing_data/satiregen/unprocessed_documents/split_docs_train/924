Yennefer and Istredd become lovers while finishing their training. While Yennefer has the chance to transform her body into her ideal image during graduation, the Brotherhood of Sorcerers discuss the allocation of their newly initiated to their respective kingdoms. But through Stregobor's scheme, Yennefer is assigned to Nilfgaard instead of her preferred Aedirn due to her elven blood. Realizing what happened, Yennefer angrily breaks up with Istredd knowing only he could have told Stregobor about her blood. In 2008, Brown debuted Passport to Great Weekends, which showcased her in a more informal light as well as following her on more unique, off-the-beaten-path vacations. Episodes would follow the format of her arrival at a destination on a Friday afternoon and conclude with her leaving on Sunday evening. The second season's title was changed to Samantha Brown's Great Weekends and featured a new introduction, but mostly the same format. Keyes' last known victim was 18-year-old Samantha Koenig, a coffee booth employee in Anchorage, Alaska. Keyes kidnapped her from her workplace on February 1, 2012, took her debit card and other property, sexually assaulted her, then killed her the following day. He left her body in a shed and went to New Orleans where he departed on a pre-booked two-week cruise with his family in the Gulf of Mexico. When he returned to Alaska, he snapped a picture of a four-day-old issue of the Anchorage Daily News alongside her body, posed to appear that she was still alive.
