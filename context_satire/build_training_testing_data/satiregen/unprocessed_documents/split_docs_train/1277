The original Nilla product is the Nilla wafer, a round, thin, light wafer cookie made with flour, sugar, shortening, and eggs. Originally flavored with real vanilla, Nilla wafers have been primarily flavored with synthetic vanillin since at least 1994, a change which prompted some criticism. Presently, Nilla wafers are described as having "natural and artificial flavor", according to the ingredients list on the box. Nilla wafers are a common ingredient in banana pudding and are consequently very popular in the American South. In Atlanta and Houston, they are consistently in the five best-selling cookie brands. In 2013 the brand launched an advertising campaign on Facebook and other social media websites targeted at mothers. It was noted by the New York Times for being unique because Mondelez International, the company that Kraft created to own the brand, decided to spend all of its advertising dollars on social media rather than a combination of advertising platforms. The campaign resulted in a 9% increase in sales for Nilla. Nabisco had previously used other marketing techniques to promote the brand, including in-person events such as sponsoring banana pudding pie eating contests at amusement parks.
