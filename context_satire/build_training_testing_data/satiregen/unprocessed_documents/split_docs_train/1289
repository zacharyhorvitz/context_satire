 President Barack Obama, in awarding an overdue posthumous Medal of Honor to a Vietnam hero Wednesday, paid tribute to soldiers who received a cold reception when they returned home from the Southeast Asian war. "This month, we'll begin to mark the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War," Obama said at the White House ceremony. "A time when, to our shame, the soldiers didn't receive the respect and the thanks that they deserve. A mistake that must never be repeated."  Vice President Joe Biden kicks off a two-day swing Wednesday through the eastern edge of the must-win battleground state of Ohio, an area that President Barack Obama is unlikely to visit this election year. And while the vice president apologized to the president last week for seemingly jumping the gun on the issue of same-sex marriage, this trip is an illustration of just how valuable Biden is for Obama as he bids for a second term in the White House. "As much as political insiders joke about Joe Biden, he's indispensable to the Obama ticket," says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. According to the Obama re-election campaign, the vice president will travel to Ohio's Mahoning and Ohio valleys "to highlight the impact of President Obama's efforts to strengthen the region's manufacturing and auto industries, as well as bolster middle-class security for Ohio's workers." On April 30, 2016, The Onion hosted a Biden-themed event to coincide with the White House Correspondents' Dinner. Titled "Diamond Joe Biden's Badass Balls-to-the-Wall Fiesta", the event was hosted at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. The event featured an ice sculpture of Biden riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and a string quartet playing renditions of hair-metal songs. Biden was invited to attend, but declined.
