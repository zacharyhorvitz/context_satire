 Any Labor Day weekend plans that included a beach trip may have to be changed for residents living in coastal areas from Virginia to Connecticut as Hermine's winds pick up speed on its way north, forecasters say. "Wind and water hazards of a variety of kinds are things we have to contend with throughout Labor Day weekend," National Hurricane Center Director Rick Knabb said Saturday. "Certainly a bad weekend to be on the beach and on boats." Greg and Margee Germaine were celebrating a wedding anniversary Saturday at Atlantic City, New Jersey, having cocktails on the beach and getting blasted by sand.  Much of the Carolinas was being drenched by rain Friday as Tropical Hermine slid up the East Coast after knocking down trees and leaving hundreds of thousands without power in Florida. Forecasters with the National Weather Service said as many as 7 inches of rain could fall, and in isolated areas it could be more than that. A flash flood watch was issued for northeast South Carolina and southeast North Carolina though Saturday morning. The path of the storm, which smashed into Florida's Panhandle as a Category 1 hurricane Friday morning, is projected to move through the North Carolina coast Friday night and head into the Atlantic Ocean on Saturday.  Hours after Hurricane Hermine made landfall in Florida, the weakened storm is working its way up the East Coast. Here's a quick look at the numbers behind the storm and what to expect going into Labor Day weekend.
