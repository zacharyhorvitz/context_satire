In 1918 three professional groups, the National Association of State Supervisors and Inspectors of Rural Schools, the County Superintendent section of the NEA, and the National Association of Personnel Engaged in Preparation of Rural Educators joined the Department of Rural Education. For the first time, agricultural education was no longer included in the title of the organization and there was an evident change in the leadership of the organization in the succeeding ten years. During that period, only six of the presidents were from colleges or universities and only one of those six was associated with an agricultural school. The other presidents of the Department of Rural Education were school administrators. Following large increases in the number of women in higher education in the late nineteenth century, the number of deans of women also grew, establishing it as a professional occupation. In 1913 a graduate study program was created at Teachers College, Columbia University for deans of women. Realising that an organisation was needed to coordinate training and connections for deans, in 1915 Kathryn Sisson Phillips initiated informal meetings for the 26 women studying for the position at Teachers College for discussions, with their first formal meeting occurring at a meeting of the National Education Association on July 6, 1916. The association had begun publishing a yearbook by 1923 and a scholarly journal in 1938, the latter of which was edited by Ruth Strang. In 1968 the Association became the Rural Education Association, and in the following year CUIS elected its last president. It appears that the two groups that had been meeting together apparently merged their meeting dates, their leaders, and their goals. The growth of the adversary relationship between teachersâ€™ organizations and administrators must have resulted in an uncomfortable relationship between the Rural Education Association and its sponsoring organization, the National Rural Education Association. The rural department had expanded over the years to include county and intermediate superintendents and the leadership of the organization most often was from the ranks of administrators or representatives of higher education.
