 A man walks by and wipes a tear away from each eye. Who knows what's he been through or how many miles he is from home. He is a stranger in a new land, taking his first steps of a new life. Hundreds of migrants and refugees -- like this man -- this week filled a train station here in Munich, hoping that this stop could be one of their last ones on their grueling journey from lives of war, violence, poverty and oppression.  Europe is in the midst of an unprecedented human migration. Fleeing war, fearing for their life and dreaming of a better life far from the poverty and upheaval of their unstable nations, hundreds of thousands are flocking to Europe's shores. The migrants and refugees risk their lives in rickety boats and cramped  trucks -- only to be greeted by governments that can't agree on how, or if, to welcome them. Migrant crisis in Europe: How you can help Here's a look at the latest country-by-country developments in the refugee and migrant crisis unfolding across much of Europe: Austria: Migrants walk across border to applause Austrians applauded as buses loaded with migrants pulled up on their border with Hungary early Saturday -- and the exhausted passengers walked out toward them.  Angry scenes erupted outside Budapest's main train station Tuesday morning, as crowds of angry migrants and refugees were prevented from boarding trains they hoped would take them on from Hungary toward Western Europe. Hundreds of people who had expected to board trains to head on to Austria and Germany instead found Keleti station closed to traffic, with lines of Hungarian police officers barring their way. Tired, hungry and frustrated, the crowds chanted, "Hungary, no -- Germany, yes!" Police and officials on the ground offered contradictory lines to journalists and migrants, with some saying the station was open while others said trains were delayed by several hours.
