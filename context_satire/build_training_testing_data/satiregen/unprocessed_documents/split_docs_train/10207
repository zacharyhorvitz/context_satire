Harris' parents divorced when she was seven, and her mother was granted custody of Harris and her sister. After the divorce, when she and her sister would visit their father in Palo Alto on the weekends, she stated that neighbors' kids were not allowed to play with them because they were black. Concerning his role as Dumbledore, Harris had stated that he did not intend to take the part at first, since he knew that his health was in decline, but he relented and accepted it because his 11-year-old granddaughter threatened never to speak to him again if he did not take it. In an interview with the Toronto Star in 2001, Harris expressed his concern that his association with the Harry Potter films would outshine the rest of his career. He explained, "Because, you see, I don't just want to be remembered for being in those bloody films, and I'm afraid that's what's going to happen to me." They then make their way through rubbish-littered dumps but are unfortunately seen by Bhanu, who hasnâ€™t given up his chase. As he runs after them, we flashback to Shalini and her family watching the news of the Taj Mahal being destroyed. Her brother-in-law Naz exclaims that walls should be built to protect them, which causes disagreement and discord with his brother. The couple explains that they have decided to move to the East End, which is where we cut back to the present day.
