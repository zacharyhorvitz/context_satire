 One of President Donald Trump's attorneys in the Russia probe, Rudy Giuliani, left open the possibility that Michael Cohen might have doled out payments like the one he made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to other women. In an interview Sunday on ABC News' "This Week with George Stephanopoulos," Giuliani said Trump reimbursed Cohen with his own money in a retainer agreement for his services as Trump's personal attorney, which included $130,000 Cohen paid Daniels to keep quiet about allegations she had a sexual encounter with Trump. "The agreement with Michael Cohen, as far as I know, is a longstanding agreement that Michael Cohen takes care of situations like this then gets paid for them sometimes," Giuliani said. "So did Michael Cohen make payments to other women for the President?"  "AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake," the company's CEO Randall Stephenson said Friday morning. AT&T paid Cohen, President Trump's personal lawyer and fixer, $600,000 through a contract that ended in December 2017. The payments are now under scrutiny in part because Cohen is under federal investigation. "To be clear, everything we did was done according to the law and entirely legitimate.  Michael Cohen served loyally as Donald Trump's right-hand man for more than a decade, taking care of anything and everything the New York real estate baron needed to get done. On November 8, 2016, Cohen's stock suddenly soared: He was now the personal attorney to the President-elect of the United States, with unique understanding of a man that everyone was scrambling to get access to. Cohen quickly got to work. According to multiple people familiar with Cohen's conduct following the election, he aggressively pitched himself to potential clients, reminding them of his proximity to the most powerful man in the world.
