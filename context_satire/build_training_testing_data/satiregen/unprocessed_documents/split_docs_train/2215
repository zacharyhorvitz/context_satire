 It's called Gephyrophobia: fear of bridges. The anxiety disorder sends shivers through travelers faced with crossing high bridges that millions of drivers use every day. National headlines about bridge accidents don't help -- like the collapse of Washington's Skagit River Bridge last May and July's collision that sent a driver and her car tumbling off Maryland's Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Bridge disasters feed larger fears about whether the people we trust to inspect, repair and replace our critical infrastructure are doing their jobs. The argument used is that it is the common legal practice to date the founding of an institution from the date of founding for the oldest trust it administers. In this case, the oldest trust that the University of Pennsylvania administers was established in 1740. Historian Edward Potts Cheyney states that,  "it might be considered a lawyer's date; it is a familiar legal practice in considering the date of any institution to seek out the oldest trust it administers." (The university still administers this trust in the funding of the Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander University of Pennsylvania Partnership School.) In brief, in 1779 the College of Philadelphia was directed by provost William Smith. One might have expected it to evolve into the "University of the State of Pennsylvania" but this did not occur. "Since the Revolutionary state legislature felt that the board of trustees led by Provost Smith contained too many suspected loyalist sympathizers, they created a new board of trustees." Thus, the University of the State of Pennsylvania was created de novo.
