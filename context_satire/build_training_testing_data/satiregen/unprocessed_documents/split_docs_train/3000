Samuel Adams's name has been appropriated by commercial and non-profit ventures since his death. The Boston Beer Company created Samuel Adams Boston Lager in 1985, drawing upon the tradition that Adams had been a brewer; it became a popular award-winning brand. Adams's name is also used by a pair of non-profit organizations, the Sam Adams Alliance and the Sam Adams Foundation. These groups take their names from Adams in homage to his ability to organize citizens at the local level in order to achieve a national goal. In 1966, Campos had formed the group, The Forum which was consisted of him and 2 females. The other 2 members were Rene Nole (whom he would later marry) and a teenage girl  Riselle Bain. In 1967, the group had a hit with "The River Is Wide". They also released an album of the same name with half of the songs penned by Les Baxter. The prosperity of his law practice increased from this exposure, as did the demands on his time. In 1771, Adams moved his family to Braintree but kept his office in Boston. He noted on the day of the family's move, "Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning â€“ I am in it at 9 at night.
