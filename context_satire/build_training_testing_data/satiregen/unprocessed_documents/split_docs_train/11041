On June 5, 2003, DelCampo gained visibility as an comedic artist with his first appearance on The Howard Stern Show. According to the staff, Michael came to the station carrying instruments and skating on roller blades. Stern asked "What are you, a street musician? ", to which he confirmed and carried on in an English accent and did impersonations of mostly singers. In the present, Julie decides to meet with her son, despite her current family's protestations that the meeting would be too painful. When she does meet her son Scott, who is a minister, they bond immediately. Scott is also looking for his father, Steve, and Julie agrees to help him. She tracks Steve down to his office, and he ends up returning to Dobbs Mill to meet Julie in person. The pair spend the day exploring the town as they walk down memory lane together, and they discover that despite being apart for many years, they still have feelings for each other. Julie's grown-up daughter from a previous marriage disapproves this development, especially since Julie has recently become engaged to another man.
