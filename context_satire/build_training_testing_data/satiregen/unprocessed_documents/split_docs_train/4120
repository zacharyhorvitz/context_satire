China is also second only to the United States in venture capital activity and is home to a large number of unicorn startup companies. In 2018, China attracted $105 billion of venture capital investments, amounting to 38% of global VC investments that year. In late 2018, the world's most valuable startup was ByteDance, a Chinese company; and the two most valuable artificial intelligence (AI) startups in the world were SenseTime and Face++, both from China. In 2017, China's State Council released its Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, which declared AI technology a priority economic growth and investment sector. Silicon Valley is a region in the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California that serves as a global center for high technology, innovation, and social media. It corresponds roughly to the geographical Santa Clara Valley, although its boundaries have increased in recent decades. San Jose is the Valley's largest city, the third-largest in California, and the tenth-largest in the United States. Other major Silicon Valley cities include Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Redwood City, Cupertino, Santa Clara, Mountain View, and Sunnyvale.  Tucked away in the Ozark Mountains, near the birthplace of America's largest retailer, there's a thriving ecosystem for entrepreneurs. In the last five years, nearly 300 startups have launched in northwest Arkansas -- home to Wal-Mart -- raising more than $190 million in funding, according to Jeff Amerine, director at the University of Arkansas' Technology Ventures. The world's largest retailer is headquartered in Bentonville, and over the past few decades, more than 1,300 of its suppliers, including Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Nestle, have opened offices in the region solely dedicated to managing relationships with the retail giant. Over the years, this drew top-notch corporate talent to Arkansas but also dominated jobs and economic activity in the region.
