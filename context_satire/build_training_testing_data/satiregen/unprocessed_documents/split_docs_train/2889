Guttenberg, on September 4, 2018, at a hearing for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination, Guttenberg introduced himself to the nominee Kavanaugh who looked at him but then turned away without shaking his hand. The encounter was the basis of a written question from Senators and Guttenberg found Kavanaugh's response less than credible.  Fred Guttenberg, the father of a slain Parkland student, said on Twitter that he tried to approach Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh only for the judge to ignore him. The incident occurred as the Senate Judiciary Committee took a recess shortly after noon Tuesday. "Just walked up to Judge Kavanaugh as morning session ended. Put out my hand to introduce myself as Jaime Guttenberg's dad.  Fred Guttenberg, the father of a slain Parkland student, said he had approached Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at his confirmation hearing Tuesday in an attempt to appeal to him "as a dad," but when he extended his hand he was ignored by the judge. "I simply said, 'Hi, my name is Fred Guttenberg, I'm the father of Jaime Guttenberg, who was murdered in Parkland,' " Guttenberg told Kate Bolduan on CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront." "As soon as I got to the 'murdered in Parkland,' that's when you saw him turn and move and walk the other way." White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah addressed the moment on Twitter earlier Tuesday, saying, "As Judge Kavanaugh left for his lunch break, an unidentified individual approached him.
