Obama and Biden won re-election in 2012, defeating a Mitt Romney-Paul Ryan ticket. The campaign focused largely on the Affordable Care Act and President Obama's stewardship of the economy, as the country still faced high unemployment numbers and a rising national debt stemming from the Great Recession. While Republicans lost seven seats in the House in the November congressional elections, they still retained control of that chamber. However, Republicans were not able to gain control of the Senate, continuing their minority status with a net loss of two seats. It would be no exaggeration to say that the Republican Party has been in a state of panic since the defeat of Mitt Romney, not least because the election highlighted American demographic shifts and, relatedly, the party's failure to appeal to Hispanics, Asians, single women and young voters. Hence the Republican leadership's new willingness to pursue immigration reform, even if it angers the conservative base. The 2020 Republican Party presidential primaries and caucuses will be a series of elections taking place in many U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories. These events will elect most of the 2,550 delegates to send to the Republican National Convention. Delegates to the national convention may otherwise be elected by the respective state party organizations. The delegates to the national convention will vote, by ballot, to select the Republican Party's nominee for president of the United States in the 2020 election, where the majority will be bound by the results of their respective state contests on the first ballot.
