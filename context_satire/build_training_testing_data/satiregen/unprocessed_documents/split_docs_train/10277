Saaphyri and Buckwild have brought four girls in the house because they really want Flav to find love. The new girls then introduce themselves to Flav. The first girl up wants to be called Blue because of her eyes, but Flav names her Black because of the color of her clothes. The remaining 12 contestants were taken back to Warren Tricomi salon and got their makeovers. During the makeover process, Jay spoke with each of the girls to help them to establish their individual styles, Jade thought she looked bad in short hair and wanted to chose long hair extensions instead.

Nnenna won her second challenge for her interpretation of the "new African queen," and once again chose Jade and Gina to accompany her for a $5,000 shopping spree at Nanette Lepore.
