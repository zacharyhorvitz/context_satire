While many states hold primary elections, relatively few states hold statewide, multilevel caucuses. Party leaders and state officials believed that switching from a primary election to a caucus would streamline Nevada's move to becoming an early contender in the nomination process. As a result of switching from a late presidential primary to an early caucus, Nevada has gained electoral prominence. The 2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses took place in Nevada, United States, on February 22, 2020, with early voting on February 14â€“18, and was the third nominating contest in the Democratic Party primaries for the 2020 presidential election, following the New Hampshire primary the week before. The Nevada caucuses are a closed caucus, meaning that only registered Democrats could vote in this caucus. The state awarded 48 delegates towards the 2020 Democratic National Convention, of which 36 are pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the caucuses. In late August 2019, the Democratic National Committee ordered both the Iowa and Nevada Democratic state parties to scrap their plans for "virtual caucuses" because of security concerns.
