A film adaptation of the first game was announced in 2005. Creator David Jaffe confirmed that a completed script had been written by David Self and would be sent to an unspecified director. He said that Universal Studios was behind the making of the God of War movie, but was unaware of its status, and eventually said, "it's doubtful that the film will even be made". In September 2010, Jaffe said that the "script went out a year and a half ago to Daniel Craig who plays  Bond, but he turned it down".  Juice WRLD's girlfriend Ally Lotti honored him at Rolling Loud in Los Angeles over the weekend, where the rapper was supposed to perform before his sudden death last week. Lotti took the stage at the end of a set by A Boogie, G Herbo and Ski Mask the Slump God, telling the audience that Juice WRLD was full of love. "I just wanted to come out here and let everyone know that Jarad loved every single person that he helped on this Earth," Lotti said. "He literally loved every single one of you." God of War III was first released in North America on March 16, 2010, for the PlayStation 3. Reigniting the Great War, Kratos is soon abandoned by the Titans, who were only using him to exact their own revenge. Helped by the spirit of Athena who was elevated to a new level of understanding, she instructs him to seek the Flame of Olympus in order to defeat Zeus. Kratos engages the gods and the Titans in an epic series of battles across the Underworld and Olympus and learns that Pandora's Box is within the Flame.
