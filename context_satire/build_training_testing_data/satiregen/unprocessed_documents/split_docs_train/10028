After the golden years of the 1920s, the Great Depression in the United States (1929–1941) hit Northwestern hard. Its annual income dropped 25 percent from $4.8 million in 1930-31 to $3.6 million in 1933-34. Investment income shrank, fewer people could pay full tuition, and annual giving from  alumni and philanthropy fell from $870,000 in 1932 to a low of  $331,000 in 1935. The university responded with two salary cuts of 10 percent each for all employees.
