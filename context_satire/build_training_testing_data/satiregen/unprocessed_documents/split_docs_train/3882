The first person, who was not a Native-American, to settle the area was Thomas F. McMillan. His cabin at the base of Mars Hill is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Santa Fe Railroad built a town nearby which they named Flagstaff and during the 1880s, the town opened its first post office. The origins of the town name of Flagstaff came about when in July 4, 1855, a surveyor for the Santa Fe Railroad by the name of Samuel Clark Hudson, accompanied by his team, climbed a tall pine tree and tied a flag. In February 2009, the Government Accountability Office evaluated whether the Forest Service should be moved from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior, which already includes the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management, managing some 438,000,000 acres (1,770,000Â km2) of public land. The Government Accountability Office did not offer a recommendation. The Forest Service remains under USDA. On July 2, 1862, William and Jim Anderson returned to Council Grove and sent an accomplice to Baker's house claiming to be a traveler seeking supplies. Baker and his brother-in-law brought the man to a store, where they were ambushed by the Anderson brothers. After a brief gunfight, Baker and his brother-in-law fled into the store's basement. The Andersons barricaded the door to the basement and lit the store on fire, killing Baker and his brother-in-law.
