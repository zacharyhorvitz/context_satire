Bryan John Charnley was born on 20 September 1949 in Stockton-on-Tees. With his twin brother he grew up in London, Chislehurst in Kent, Cranfield, where his father worked as a Senior Lecturer, and finally in Bromham near Bedford. In the summer of 1968, aged 18, he suffered a nervous breakdown but was able to study at Leicester School of Art later that year. In 1969, Charnley gained a place at the Central School of Art and Design in Holborn, London but was unable to complete the course due to another breakdown that was later diagnosed as acute schizophrenia. Perez also experienced a championship of another sort first-hand. As a neighbor of baseball player Pat Burrell, he had been very close to the Philadelphia Phillies for several years. In a January 2010 interview, he revealed, "I was part of that (2008) team (that won the World Series) because I know all of the guys, I had my locker there, I would come and see them all the time. I would really root for them like I was part of the team." Perez began playing in bands at the age of 13 and discovered Honky Tonk music when he first heard "Guitars and Cadillacs" by Dwight Yoakam, with whom he would later perform. “Hearing that really turned me around and it gave me a focus. From then on I started to learn everything I could about that music. But then I also had that rock ’n’ roll background, too.” In 2003, Perez replaced Nick Kane in the Mavericks, just a short time before the band broke up.
