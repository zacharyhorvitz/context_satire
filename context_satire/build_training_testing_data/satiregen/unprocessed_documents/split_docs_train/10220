 Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley said Thursday he'd be willing to meet with Judge Merrick Garland, but firmly rejected the idea of considering his nomination to the Supreme Court even in a lame-duck session of Congress. Grassley, an Iowa Republican facing reelection, said a meeting with Garland wouldn't change his mind that President Barack Obama's nomination to the high court should not move forward this year. He said he would talk about possibly meeting with Garland after Easter. "If I can meet with a dictator in Uganda, I can surely meet with a decent person in America," Grassley said Thursday.  Wednesday's nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court was shockingly nonpartisan. Nominees are supposed to energize the President's political base. Garland, an open-minded moderate, won't. Nominees are supposed to be young.  President Barack Obama said he had a candid conversation with Judge Merrick Garland -- his pick for the Supreme Court -- about how a contentious nomination process could affect him and his family. "For those of us who are more often in the scrum of politics, we call folks like Judge Garland 'civilians,'" Obama told NPR in an interview released Friday. "And so, suddenly being placed in a war zone like this is something that you want to make sure they're mindful of." Republicans in the Senate, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said they will not hold a nomination hearing for Garland or vote on his nomination, arguing the next President should pick a replacement for deceased Justice Antonin Scalia.
