22 episodes of Harlem Globetrotters were eventually produced: 16 for the 1970-71 season, and six more for the 1971-72 season. Harlem Globetrotters has a place in history as being the first Saturday morning cartoon to feature a predominately African-American cast; Filmation's The Hardy Boys had been the first to feature an African-American character the previous year. Another Hanna-Barbera series, Josie and the Pussycats, premiered 30 minutes earlier than Harlem Globetrotters on the same day and network, and was the first Saturday morning cartoon to feature an African-American female character. Like many other Saturday morning cartoons of the era, the first-season episodes utilized a laugh track. Harrison was discovered in 1954 when he faced The Harlem Globetrotters as a member of the College All-American team during the World Series of Basketball. Later described as an "iconic figure" for the Globetrotters, Harrison was known to be an "outstanding dribbler and rebounder." During his basketball career, it is estimated that Harrison traveled to more than 100 counties. Harrison also had tea with Queen Elizabeth and played for an audience of three popes. "Aside from my family, being a Harlem Globetrotter has been the greatest highlight of my life. I have had the good fortune to be a part of the most celebrated sports team in history."
