 Forty days after he began his presidency with a dark and foreboding inaugural speech, President Donald Trump on Tuesday night spoke in broadly optimistic tones throughout his first address to a joint session of Congress. If Trump's words on January 20 bore the tone of his divisive campaign, his remarks on Capitol Hill were remarkable for just how much they resembled similar speeches from his predecessors. Opponents and critics will note that, in its substance, Trump did little to back down from his most controversial plans. But his nods to the more conventional tropes of the genre created an unlikely juxtaposition.  President Donald Trump is set to deliver his first address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night -- where he's expected to make the case for a budget that boosts defense spending and slashes funding for agencies.

His Republican National Convention speech painted a picture of a struggling nation in need of rescue.  President Donald Trump is set to give an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday -- but it technically won't be his first State of the Union address.

Traditionally, a president of the United States should be in office for a year before they give their first State of the Union address.
