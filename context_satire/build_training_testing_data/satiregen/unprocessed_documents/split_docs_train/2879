Stacey Abrams had long been involved with the Democratic Party and had served as a Democratic leader in the Georgia House of Representatives. In 2018 Stacy Abrams ran for Governor of Georgia against Brian Kemp. This race received national attention for irregularities in voter access to the ballot. Kemp was serving as Secretary of State during this race which led to criticism that he was biased against potential Abrams voters.  Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams is refusing to accept Republican rival Brian Kemp's declaration of victory in the Georgia gubernatorial race and is considering legal action in the high-profile contest. "Our opponent has had his office declare himself the victor and we do not accept that," the Abrams campaign said in a phone call with reporters Wednesday evening.
