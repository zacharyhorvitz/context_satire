Back in Germany (after May 1949, West Germany) the Langs settled in Frankfurt am Main. In January 1951 Erna Lang rejoined the SPD, and she remained politically engaged. Joseph Lang, also a member of the party, played an important part in trades union and party affairs in the Frankfurt and South Hessen regions until his death in 1973. By 1981 it was reported that Erna was living in a retirement home in Frankfurt, the city in which she died on 18 May 1983. Shortly after arriving in New York Erna Halbe and Joseph Lang married. They support themselves initially through casual work,  later setting up a little textiles business. After 1945, with friends, they organised support for a number of persecuted socialists in Germany. At the end of 1950 Joseph and Erna Lang returned to Germany where till 1954 Erna Lang continued to work for the Frankfurt office of the International Rescue Committee. The Financial Times reported that Lang is "evangelical in his efforts to spread the popularity of classical music." In October 2008, he launched the Lang International Music Foundation in New York with the support of the Grammys and UNICEF. In May 2009, Lang and his three chosen scholars from the foundation—Charlie Liu, Anna Larsen, and Derek Wang, aged between eight and 10 years old—performed together on The Oprah Winfrey Show.
