In an unfavorable review, The Hollywood Reporter's Jonny Coleman deemed the album " joyless mess" and summarized, "Minaj doesn't really investigate any of her issues with herself or others in any meaningful way on the new album. When all is said and done, it's just another playlist of disconnected mish-mash bangers that we'll probably forget in two weeks." An article of The New York Times noted the album's first two singles "have failed to stick commercially." The Atlantic's Spencer Kornhaber criticized its lyrical content, writing, "When Minaj raps on "Hard White" that she "ain't ever have to strip to get the pole position," it's a clear knock on the former exotic dancer who's outcharting her lately, but it also undermines Minaj's broader position that women who use sex appeal and their brains deserve respect. Hodgson decided to leave the series halfway through Season Five due to his dislike of being on-camera and his disagreements with producer Mallon over creative control of the program. Hodgson also stated that Mallon's insistence on producing a feature film version of the show led to his departure, giving up his rights on the MST3K property to Mallon. Hodgson later told an interviewer: "If I had the presence of mind to try and work it out, I would rather have stayed. 'Cause I didn't want to go, it just seemed like I needed to." Frederick graduated from the old Greenfield High School in 1888 and went on to Ohio State University. While at the university, he played on the football team in his junior year on the 1891 Ohio State Buckeyes football team, the first African American to do so. He withdrew from college in his senior year before graduating, taking a job as a high school history teacher in Louisville, Kentucky. It was a different career than his father's business, where his older brother was already working.
