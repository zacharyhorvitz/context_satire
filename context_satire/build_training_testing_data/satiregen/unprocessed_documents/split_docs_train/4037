 Valentine's Day is just around the corner, which for many means pressure to find the perfect gift. Heart-themed chocolates are flooding store aisles, but this may the February when refined sugar may not make the cut. The past few years have seen an increase in people adopting healthier plant-based diets or following strict keto and Whole-30 eating plans. Plus, not everyone is ready to give up on those New Year's resolutions so early in the year. While the custom of sending cards, flowers, chocolates and other gifts originated in the UK, Valentine's Day still remains connected with various regional customs in England. In Norfolk, a character called 'Jack' Valentine knocks on the rear door of houses leaving sweets and presents for children. Although he was leaving treats, many children were scared of this mystical person. In Iran, the Sepandarmazgan, or Esfandegan, is a festival where people express love towards their mothers and wives, and it is also a celebration of earth in ancient Persian culture. It has been progressively forgotten in favor of the Western celebration of Valentine's Day. The Association of Iran's Cultural and Natural Phenomena has been trying since 2006 to make Sepandarmazgan a national holiday on February 17, in order to replace the Western holiday.
