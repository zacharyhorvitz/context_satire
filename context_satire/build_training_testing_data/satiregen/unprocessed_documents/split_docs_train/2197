Imaginaria Sonora is their fifth studio album of Bohemia Suburbana: a journey to the roots of the band and a leap into the future. The twelve songs were the result of a process of collective creation among Giovanni Pinzón, Álvaro Rodríguez, Pepe Mollinedo, Juancarlos Barrios and Josué García, who in addition to being good friends, are professional musicians and music lovers. The result is according to Pinzón: "A rock-and- roll eclectic proposal; an updated version of Bohemia." In May 2007, with the support of a Guatemalan producer and old friends of the band, Bohemia Suburbana reunited in Miami, Florida. Over the following month, the band composed and recorded material for a new album. At the beginning of 2008, the band played a series of concerts in Puerto Rico. Afterwards, the band decided to focus on the composing and recording of new material. Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars and described it as "a skillful meat-and-potatoes action extravaganza with some added neat touches". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, "The latter part of From Dusk till Dawn is so relentless that it's as if a spigot has been turned on and then broken. Though some of the tricks are entertainingly staged, the film loses its clever edge when its action heats up so gruesomely and exploitatively that there's no time for talk". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a "B" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, "Rodriguez and Tarantino have taken the let-'em-eat-trash cynicism of modern corporate moviemaking and repackaged it as junk-conscious 'attitude.'
