In 2020, President Donald J. Trump made a divisive speech attacking the faith of others at the National Prayer Breakfast. The event was held shortly after the acquittal on impeachment vote in the Senate, where Senator Mitt Romney voted against party line for his impeachment. Also at the event was House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi who had tense moments with the President during the State of the Union address the prior night. Kevin Kruse, a Princeton University historian was quoted stating “This event has usually been to bring Washington together.... And that instead he used it to further denigrate others’ faith and cast doubt on their public expressions of faith is stunning.” In 1988, the law was amended so that the National Day of Prayer would be held on the first Thursday of May. Two stated intentions of the National Day of Prayer were that it would be a day when adherents of all great religions could unite in prayer and that it may one day bring renewed respect for God to all the peoples of the world. In January–February 1952 during the Korean War, the desirability of a united national prayer was stated by Reverend Billy Graham, who said, "What a thrilling, glorious thing it would be to see the leaders of our country today kneeling before Almighty God in prayer. What a thrill would sweep this country. What renewed hope and courage would grip the Americans at this hour of peril." Representative Percy Priest from Tennessee observed that Graham had issued a challenge for a national day of prayer.
