Despite the fact that the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts annually bestows a Mark Twain Prize for American Humor (usually on comedians) since 1998, this award does not by itself qualify the recipient as a humorist. As of 2017 only two recipients, Steve Martin and Neil Simon, are known as humorists, being humorous playwrights. Gold Turkey was also subsequently issued as a CD. The title of the album is a reference to the phrase "cold turkey", meaning to suffer sudden withdrawal from an addictive substance;  John Lennon performed the  song Cold Turkey. "Gold Turkey" as shown in the cover photograph by Arky & Barrett is a visual pun on the golden statue awards for entertainment, such as the Oscars and the Emmy Awards, and is simultaneously a verbal pun on the word "turkey" meaning a box-office bomb or entertainment failure. Gold Turkey is an American album of sketch comedy that was first released as a vinyl record in 1975. It was a spin-off from National Lampoon magazine. The album is a collection of "greatest hits" from the National Lampoon Radio Hour, a show broadcast on 600 radio stations from November 17, 1973, to December 28, 1974. The sketches on Gold Turkey feature numerous National Lampoon actors, including Christopher Guest, Bill Murray, John Belushi, Brian Doyle-Murray, Chevy Chase, Harold Ramis, Gilda Radner, Joe Flaherty, and Ed Subitzky.
