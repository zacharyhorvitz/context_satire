 President Barack Obama's Keystone pipeline headache is only going to get worse. Democrats -- in their final weeks of controlling the Senate -- successfully blocked a bill Tuesday that would authorize the pipeline from hitting the president's desk. But the reprieve won't last long. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately vowed that Keystone would be "an early item on the agenda in the next Congress."  Legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline is headed back to Congress after President Barack Obama vetoed the bill Tuesday. Obama's veto of the bill comes after a yearslong debate on the controversial pipeline which ultimately handed a legislative victory to proponents of the pipeline after Republicans took control of the Senate in January. The House and Senate may have come together to send a single piece of legislation to Obama, but don't expect that agreement to lead to construction permits for the pipeline project that would ship crude oil from Canada to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. Republicans may have enough Democratic support to clear a filibuster, but they'll be hard-pressed to find the 67 votes to override a veto.  Last-minute jostling in Louisiana's Senate race has given sudden life to long-stalled legislation to authorize the Keystone XL pipeline. Both houses of Congress are on track to vote in the coming days on proposals sponsored by the candidates who will face off in a December Senate runoff in Louisiana. The House has scheduled a vote for Friday on a bill to green-light the $8 billion project to transport oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. The Senate, meanwhile, is likely to vote early next week on similar legislation.
