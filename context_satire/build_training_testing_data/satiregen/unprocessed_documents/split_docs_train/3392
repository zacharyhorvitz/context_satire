 On Tuesday morning, CNN's Poppy Harlow interviewed Janet Porter, a spokeswoman for Roy Moore's Senate campaign, about the accusations made by multiple women that the Alabama Republican pursued relationships with them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Two women have said Moore sexually abused them. Moore has denied all the allegations. The interview was stunning for lots of reasons -- not the least of which is that Porter tried to make an issue out of the fact that Poppy is pregnant.  Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Thursday that Senate Republicans will have little choice but to seat Alabama Senate hopeful Roy Moore if he wins next month. "If he is elected, there are no grounds under the Constitution to fail to seat him," Collins said at a breakfast held by The Christian Science Monitor. "The Constitution says you can only look at citizenship, whether they are a resident of the state, and if they are the proper age. So we have to seat him."  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell changed his tone Sunday on whether he thought Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore should be in the Senate, saying he would "let the people of Alabama make the call" in the state's special election December 12. On ABC's "This Week," McConnell said that if Moore wins, the Senate Ethics Committee would have to consider the allegations against him. "I think we're going to let the people of Alabama decide a week from Tuesday who they want to send to the Senate, and then we'll address the matter appropriately," McConnell said. Referring to the committee, the Kentucky Republican added: "I'm confident they'll come up with the right conclusion."
