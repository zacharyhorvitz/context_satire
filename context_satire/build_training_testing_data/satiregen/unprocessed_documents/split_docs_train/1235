Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review, writing that "While the beats of the story are often stock, the picture benefits from sensitive direction by New Zealander Niki Caro and from a most appealing performance by Kevin Costner." James Rocchi of The Wrap wrote "A feel-good movie that earns all those good feelings, McFarland USA might be running on a predetermined track, but the heart it shows along the journey is what makes it a winner." A.O. Scott of The New York Times described the film favorably as "a slick and safe Disney version of a fascinating and complicated reality", and that "Mr. Costner, with his knack for grumpy understatement, manages both to dominate the film and to deflect attention from himself." Costner brought on Reynolds to direct the post-apocalyptic film Waterworld (1995). Mid-way through filming, production problems led to conflict between them. It was reported Reynolds walked away near the end of post-production, leaving star/producer Costner to supervise the completion of editing. The two friends stopped speaking; Reynolds was later quoted as having said of Costner: "Kevin should only star in movies he directs. "Very Big Riding Hood": After hearing that Bailey has a stomach ache, Emily and Clifford set out to cheer her up with a box of heart-shaped treats. However, the treats become popular with the other animals, and for each animal they come across on their way to her house, Emily and Clifford gives them one. When they reach Bailey's house, there aren't any treats left for her, but they still attempt to cheer her up.
