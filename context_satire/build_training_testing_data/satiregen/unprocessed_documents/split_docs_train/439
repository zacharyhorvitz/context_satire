 At a coming-out party for its upcoming PlayStation 4 console, Sony leveled its guns at rival Microsoft's Xbox One device and fired until the chambers were empty. During a press event Monday night at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, Sony hammered home key points about its new gaming system: Sharing games will be free. If people want to sell used games, that's fine. And a near-constant Internet connection, meant to monitor game usage, won't be required.  With lingering questions about privacy, game trading and selling, and an "always-on" Kinect device, Microsoft has released new details about the new Xbox One console, hoping to address issues that have had some fans in an uproar. The details come a week before the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) next week in Los Angeles and, presumably, are meant to free up the company to focus on games and features, not consumer concerns, during its major showcase there. Among the new details: Up to 10 family members will be able to log in and play purchased Xbox One games from anywhere. The unique proposition addresses concerns from fans about being able to play where they want, and when they want, in an era when game companies worry about protecting digital rights.  Much of the focus this week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the video game industry's big annual trade show, will be on Microsoft and Sony, which both have new game consoles coming in time for the holiday shopping season. But the spotlight inside the Los Angeles Convention Center won't be so much on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 as what's really important: the games themselves. With these two next-generation consoles on the near horizon, game developers are in a transitional period between the new devices and the ones that people enjoy in their homes right now. Many of the titles featured during E3 may be playable immediately, with a next-gen option down the road.
