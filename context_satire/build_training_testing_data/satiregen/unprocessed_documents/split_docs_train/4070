"God Bless the U.S.A." (also known as "Proud To Be An American") is an American patriotic song written and recorded by American country music artist Lee Greenwood, and is considered to be his signature song. The first album it appears on is 1984's You've Got a Good Love Comin'. It reached No. 7 on the Billboard magazine Hot Country Singles chart when originally released in the spring of 1984, and was played at the 1984 Republican National Convention with President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan in attendance, but the song gained greater prominence during the Gulf War in 1990 and 1991, as a way of boosting morale, and was re-included on his 1992 album American Patriot as a result of its newfound popularity.

Greenwood is known for writing and recording "God Bless the USA" in the early 1980s. The song gained renewed popularity following the launch of Operation: Desert Storm in 1991, and again, 10 years later, following the September 11, 2001 attacks. "God Bless the USA" re-entered the top 20 of the country charts in late 2001. Since then, Greenwood has played at many public events and commemorations of the attacks.
