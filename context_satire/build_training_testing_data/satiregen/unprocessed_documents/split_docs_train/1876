Joe Sr. had aspirations for Joe Jr. to become president. Joe Jr. was a delegate to the 1940 Democratic National Convention and planned to run for a seat in the United States House of Representatives after his military service as the first stepping stone on the path to the White House. His death while participating in a top-secret mission in 1944 caused Joe Sr. to transfer his aspirations to his next-oldest son, John F. Kennedy. John Kennedy followed the path first planned for Joe Jr., advancing from the US House to the United States Senate to the presidency.  Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts has announced a run for Senate on Saturday morning at the East Boston Social Center, challenging Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, who has served in Congress for more than 40 years. "We have a Senate that instead of trying to harness the opportunity and potential of every person in this country, they're trying to pull us back," Kennedy said Saturday in announcing his run. "And I'm running for the United States Senate to tear that down, to fight back with everything we've got." In recent weeks, Kennedy, 38, has sought to draw a generational contrast with Markey, 73, while benefiting from the goodwill shown for the generations of Kennedys who have represented the state before him.  Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts, the heir to his family's political dynasty, will announce a run for Senate on Saturday morning at the East Boston Social Center, challenging Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, who has served in Congress for more than 40 years, according to a source familiar. In recent weeks, Kennedy, 38, has sought to draw a generational contrast with the 73-year-old Markey. "Sen. Markey is a good man," Kennedy said in August. "I think I've got new ideas and a new approach and if I get into this race, that's what this race will be about."
