 This week North Korea sentenced an American student to 15 years of hard labor after the student was arrested for allegedly removing a political flag from a hotel. A Human Rights Watch officials condemned the sentence in a statement: "North Korea's sentencing of Otto Warmbier to 15 years hard labor for a college-style prank is outrageous and shocking, and should not be permitted to stand." The U.S. State Department has responded that the punishment for Warmbier, a University of Virginia student, is "unduly harsh," and called for his release. Some may think that's the least the Department of State can do. American University is also home to a unique program known as the Washington Semester Program. This program partners with institutions around the world to bring students to AU for a semester. The program operates as part of the School of Professional & Extended Studies. The program combines two seminar courses on three days a week with a two-day-per-week internship that gives students a unique look at Washington, D. C. The program is unique in that the courses are not typical lecture courses; instead, speakers from various sectors of a particular field are invited to address the class, often from different perspectives.  Feminism in the United States is back in the spotlight, but it looks a lot different than it has in the past. Once considered the bastion of wealthier, educated white women, today's feminists are a much more diverse group who are dealing with a complex set of stereotypes and perceptions. They must face the biases that come with being both a woman and a member of a certain race, class or religion. Muslim-American women know this all too well.
