On Continuum, Reardon plays Greg Cameron, the husband of the main character, Kiera Cameron. According to Reardon, "Greg on the surface appears to be a clean-cut family man who is a respectable law-abiding member of society. The memory of Greg, along with their son Sam, is an anchor for Kiera when she is transported back in time and taken away from her family. However, as season one progresses, it appears that Greg may not be what he seems." On Arctic Air, John Reardon portrayed Blake Laviolette, a young, good-looking "Top Gun-type" pilot who was secretly involved with his coworker and fellow pilot Krista Ivarson. According to Reardon, his character is "a fascinating duality because Blake is a bit of a cocky hotshot pilot who, I think, just found himself in the north and Yellowknife as a bit of a stepping stone to moving to what he probably considered his dream job. However, once he gets there, he starts to realize that thereâ€™s something about that part of the country that gets to people. In fact, it starts to get to him and he begins to fall in love with the north, followed by Krista . When CBS first approached him about making more Star Trek series, Kurtzman believed that Picard was the greatest Star Trek captain and included a series featuring the character on his wish list. Despite Stewart's statements that he was done with the franchise, Kurtzman and Goldsman contacted Stewart in late 2017, initially to see if he would be willing to appear in a Star Trek: Short Treks episode. Kurtzman, Goldsman and Discovery writer Kirsten Beyer met with the actor, who took the meeting with the intention of turning the project down, but was intrigued enough by their discussion to ask them for a three-page document outlining their ideas. At that time, Goldsman invited novelist Michael Chabon, a friend, to work on the project as well and the four ultimately produced a 34-page document that they sent to Stewart.
