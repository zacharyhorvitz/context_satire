Born in South Orange, New Jersey and growing up in suburban Wilton, Connecticut, Browne assisted his father on the comic strips Hi and Lois and Hägar the Horrible. He contributed to Hägar from the beginning of the comic in 1972 and co-authored Hägar the Horrible's Very Nearly Complete Viking Handbook in 1985. When Dik Browne died in 1989, Chris Browne continued the strip, both writing and drawing, while Chance Browne took over Hi and Lois. He currently lives in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Hägar the Horrible is the title and main character of an American comic strip created by cartoonist Dik Browne, and syndicated by King Features Syndicate. It first appeared in February 1973, and was an immediate success. Since Browne's retirement in 1988 (and subsequent death), his son Chris Browne has continued the strip. As of 2010, Hägar is distributed to 1,900 newspapers in 56 countries and translated into 12 languages. Chris Browne (born 1952) is an American comic strip artist and cartoonist. He is the son of cartoonist Dik Browne  and brother of cartoonist Chance Browne. Browne writes and draws the comic strip Hägar the Horrible, which is distributed by King Features Syndicate.
