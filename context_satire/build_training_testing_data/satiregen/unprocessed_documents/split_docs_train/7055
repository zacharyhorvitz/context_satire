Bunge was immediately hospitalized after the Terrapins' loss to Temple, missing the pep rally held for the Terrapins, and his weight had fallen to well under 200 pounds. Bunge suffered from ulcerative colitis that was first discovered during his freshman year at Maryland, and he had lost 55 pounds at that time. He would experience fatigue, drastic weight loss, anemia and had to endure regular transfusions. "When I came back for my sophomore year, I couldn't run up and down the floor" he said. Bunge was born on September 21, 1919 in Buenos Aires (Argentina). His mother, Marie Herminie MÃ¼ser, was a German nurse who left Germany just before the beginning of World War I. His father, Augusto Bunge, also of some German descent, was an Argentinian physician and socialist legislator. Mario, who was the couple's only child, was raised without any religious education, and enjoyed a happy and stimulating childhood in the outskirts of Buenos Aires. The San Francisco Weekly wrote that during her 2005 European tour, Saint's belongings were stolen, which the paper said, "may have been the best thing that ever happened to her. ... Her slashed, duct-taped, hand-painted 'Trash Couture' creations were such a hit that she now sells them online."
