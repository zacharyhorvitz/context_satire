The video was made at and around Angel tube station in Islington, London, and was uploaded to YouTube on 22 April 2010. It depicts the story of a young woman addicted to drugs, portrayed by Selina MacDonald, who's seen trying to earn money selling The Big Issue magazine on the streets of London, actually selling one to Sheeran himself. The girl's struggles, both financial and existential, result in her prostituting herself to get money to buy crack. In the end, the girl dies alone in her room from her drug use, the outcome being the preface of the video, where a tearful grieving woman can be seen beside her corpse. In 2016, Lipa and her father set up the Sunny Hill Foundation in Pristina to donate to the citizens of Kosovo, her parents' home country. In August 2018, Lipa hosted her own festival to raise money for the Sunny Hill Foundation, called the SunnyHill Festival where she also performed. The Mayor of Pristina, Shpend Ahmeti then awarded Lipa the Key to Pristina the first time such an honour had ever been granted. She hosted the festival for the second year in a row in 2019, with Miley Cyrus as one of the performers. Lipa performed at F1 Singapore Grand Prix in September. In the same month, Lipa was chosen as the face of British car brand Jaguar's new electric car, I-PACE. The brand made a special remix of Lipa's song "Want To", and fans around the world can create their own version of Dua Lipa x Jaguar's song on the Join the Pace website, based on their own driving behaviour or the music they listen to, and share it on social media. Shortly after announcing the collaboration, Jaguar and Lipa set the world record for the "most remixed song ever".
