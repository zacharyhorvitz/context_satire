Before the show, the Think Tank answered quiz questions under strict conditions to determine which eight are in the tank that episode, because if a Think Tanker gets the final "Question: Impossible" correct they cannot be in the episode. Three contestants play against each other in five rounds. The phrases, "Shut the gate", "kill the goat" or "dance like a pagan" are sometimes used, similar to the phrase "Lock it in", from rival game show Millionaire Hot Seat, when selecting an answer. Some contestants have accidentally said "Lock it in" by mistake, leading to joking ridicule from the host. The show began airing also in 1986 in the United Kingdom on Saturday nights on Sky Channel. For a short time, it was shown on Tuesdays on Eurosport. Early in the 1990s, it was featured in a Friday night time slot. In the mid-1990s, Superstars was then moved to a Sunday morning time slot. The Masked Singer is based on the South Korean show King of Mask Singer. Executive producer Craig Plestis explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a Thai restaurant. While an episode of the Thai version of the show was playing on a television, he observed that the other patrons "were all just staring at this TV watching this crazy kangaroo in like a pleather outfit singing, and we didn't even finish dinner." Plestis and his daughter began to research the series, and he later secured the rights to produce an American adaptation, which he sold to Fox.
