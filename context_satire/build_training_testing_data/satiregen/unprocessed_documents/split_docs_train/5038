 President Donald Trump keeps taking Nancy Pelosi's bait. The House speaker spent the last week provoking Trump, questioning his self-confidence, condescendingly confiding that she prays for him and suggesting a "family intervention." The President's wild, improvised response Thursday suggests that so far, the speaker is winning the hugely consequential clash between Washington's top two political forces. It's not often that Trump, the man who dismembered the most talented Republican primary field in years in 2016, seems to be struggling for traction in a face-to-face political fight.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi argued Thursday the "White House is just crying out for impeachment" but that Democrats will continue to hold back on opening an impeachment inquiry until it's "unavoidable." "How we deal with it is a decision that our caucus makes, and our caucus is very much saying 'whatever we do, we need to be ready when we do it,'" Pelosi said at her weekly news conference. Pelosi has previously argued that President Donald Trump is goading Democrats into impeaching him because he thinks it will fire up his base ahead of the 2020 election. Despite a more fervent push from members in her caucus this week to open an impeachment inquiry, Pelosi continues to argue to Democrats that impeachment is "divisive" and the House is already on a steady course with their investigations.  President Donald Trump on Sunday ratcheted up his rhetoric toward Iran, warning that a fight with the United States would "be the official end of Iran." "If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran," Trump said in a tweet. "Never threaten the United States again!" The tweet comes amid rising fears over a potential military confrontation between the two countries.
