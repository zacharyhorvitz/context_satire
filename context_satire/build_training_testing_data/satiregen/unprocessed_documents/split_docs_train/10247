In December 2007, before the second film was released, Nicolas Cage showed interest in doing a third film, believing it should be more international. In early 2008, Disney registered the domains for NationalTreasure3DVD.com and NationalTreasure4DVD.com (both sites are now unregistered and the second link redirects). In May 2008, director and producer Jon Turteltaub said that the filmmaking team would take its time on another National Treasure sequel. In September 2008, producer Jerry Bruckheimer officially confirmed that they were in the process of developing a third film, and in November of that year, Bruckheimer said that the writers were in the process of writing the script to the film. As AMMO is about to be shut down due to their recent failure, Mike explains to Marcus in private that Armando may be his biological son: Before he and Marcus were partners, he was recruited by Captain Howard out of the academy to infiltrate the Aretas cartel. Being deep undercover, he had an affair with Isabel, which led to the birth of Armando as Benito was sterile, and they used to say "Hasta el fuego" to each other. Despite promising to flee with her, Mike ultimately had her arrested as well as Benito knowing how dangerous she was. All of the previous victims killed by Armando were working on the same case. In October 2013, Turteltaub stated that all individuals involved with the first two movies, want to make a third film. He further stated that the delays have been due to working out the script, and that he expected the film begin production in 2015. By 2014, producer Jerry Bruckheimer announced that a new team of writers were work the script. In May 2016, Nicolas Cage confirmed that the script was still being sorted out.
