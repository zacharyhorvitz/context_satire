 It was another scorcher at the Australian Open and for the second day in a row, a French player bore the worst of it then took aim at organizers. After Gael Monfils suspected he sustained a heat stroke in Thursday's blazing conditions, Alize Cornet crumpled to the court Friday as temperatures peaked at 40.2 degrees Celsius in Melbourne. A visibly distressed Cornet stayed down for a few moments in her third-round match against Elise Mertens on Hisense Arena before gingerly walking to her chair and receiving medical attention. The world No.  Comebacks were the order of the day at the Australian Open. Novak Djokovic, Maria Sharapova, Stan Wawrinka and Petra Kvitova all returned to Melbourne Park and all but one reached the second round Tuesday ahead of one of the city's summer heat waves. In a roller-coaster ride not unusual for a Kvitova match, the twice Wimbledon champion fell 6-3 4-6 10-8 to Andrea Petkovic in nearly three hours. Djokovic fared better.
