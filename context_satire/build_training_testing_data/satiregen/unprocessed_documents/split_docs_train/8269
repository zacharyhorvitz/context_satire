Seth is a shy man who works at an Animal Control department. He has developed an obsession with Holly, a waitress he saw writing in her journal on the bus. Seth asks security guard Nate for advice, and Nate tells him to be confident and approach her. Seth extensively researches her online profiles for information and tries to ask her out, but she rebuffs him. In the first season, Nate serves as strength for Annalise when the latter is having a hard time. He investigates the night Sam Keating left town for a conference—the same night Lila died—and discovers he went to Yale University and returned to Philadelphia during exactly the same time Lila was killed. Nate omits that fact from Annalise, but eventually reveals to her when they have a fight. By the end of the first season, Nate is charged for Sam's murder. Dr. Kroger is instrumental in trying to get Monk reinstated as a detective, all while discussing his problems and progress as a person. In the novel Mr. Monk and the Blue Flu, Natalie describes Dr. Kroger as relaxed towards everything, to such an extent that she notes that she could easily walk into his office with a monkey on her head and a hatchet in her chest, and he would not be the least bit disturbed.
