Because the character contrasts so strongly with the real person, some commentators have expressed the view that The Onion's Biden has, to some degree, supplanted the real Biden in the public imagination. In a profile of Biden for The New Republic, George Blaustein asked: The character has received widespread praise in the media. Mike Pesca, host of the podcast The Gist, said he considered the Onion's Biden to be one of "the great comic characters of our day" alongside Homer Simpson, Gob Bluth and Tobias Fünke of Arrested Development, and Selina Meyer of Veep. The month before the 2012 presidential election, Slate named the character as the best parody of Biden—topping the animated Biden on SuperNews!, Jason Sudeikis's performances on Saturday Night Live, and Bill Barol's essay "My Name Is Joe Biden and I'll Be Your Server" in The New Yorker. Time magazine ranked The Onion's Biden at number 7 on a list of the top 10 political memes of 2012. In a 2011 video interview with Yahoo! News, Biden was asked about The Onion and said most of his acquaintances and even members of the press tended to think of him as "a little bit square", but "now, I'm the philanderer. I think it's hilarious, the stuff they do on me." He also said he was "flattered" that the character was "totally inconsistent with my personality."
