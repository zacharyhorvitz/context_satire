Big Red was originally marketed exclusively in Central and South Texas and around Louisville, Kentucky, including parts of Southern Indiana. The Louisville connection was due to Roark owning the R.C. Bottling Company in Louisville and Kentucky was the first state in which this soda was available to consumers. May 16, 2018, was proclaimed "Big Red Day" by Louisville mayor Greg Fischer in recognition of the 80th anniversary of Big Red being sold in that city. On Thursday June 22, 2017, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced that he was working on banning state-funded travel to Kentucky as a response to a bill signed by Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin. The law was designed to reinforce students' ability to express religious and political views in public schools and universities. However, the bill also says religious and political student organizations cannot be hindered or discriminated against for the way they conduct their internal affairs or how they select their leaders and members. Critics say those provisions could be used to let student groups prevent LGBTQ students from joining their ranks. On June 27, 2017, Fischer announced via Twitter that the city was already feeling the negative effects of the ban, citing an "unnamed convention" that had allegedly chosen to move its venue elsewhere as a show of solidarity with the ban. He further elaborated on Facebook, stating "We are very concerned about others " and "...Tourism/conventions are a key driver of our economy." A few days later, Karen Williams, president and CEO of the Louisville Convention and Visitors Bureau, announced in a press conference with Mayor Fischer that a second convention had pulled out of the city. Williams said one convention was slated for 2018 and the other for 2021, but she declined to name them because they are "still looking for other venues outside the city."
