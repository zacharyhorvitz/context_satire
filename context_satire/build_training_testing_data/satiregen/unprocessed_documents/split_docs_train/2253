 As it turns out, diamonds in the Earth are much more common than we thought. About 1,000 times more common, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A new study by an interdisciplinary team of researchers used seismic technology (the same kind used to measure earthquakes) to estimate that a quadrillion tons of diamonds lie deep below the Earth's surface. That's 1,000,000,000,000,000 --- or one thousand times more than one trillion.  As it turns out, diamonds in the Earth are much more common than we thought.
