 The midterms are a referendum on President Donald Trump, and no place is that clearer than in Nevada. In one of the midterms' political hotbeds, Republicans and Democrats are testing the limits of using Trump as a motivating force for voters who might otherwise sit the election out. Candidates in the state's competitive House, Senate and governor's races are all trying to galvanize their bases in the middle of a crucial week of early voting by touting their support, or opposition, to Trump's agenda and style. With control of both chambers of Congress on the line, Nevada is a must-win for Democrats. Trump said in July 2016 that his father, Donald Trump, had made "hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal donations" to the Eric Trump Foundation in the past, although the Eric Trump Foundation's tax records don't explicitly show such donations. When The Washington Post followed up for evidence, Trump appeared to backtrack and refused to give details.  President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama traded blow after blow as they crossed the country in the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday's midterm elections. In Georgia and Tennessee on Sunday, Trump touted a humming economy, and in a message designed to drive the Republican base to the polls, stoked fear of what a Democratic takeover of Congress would mean on cultural issues like immigration. In Indiana and Illinois, Obama lambasted Republicans for "blatantly, repeatedly, baldly, shamelessly lying" about their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act's protections for those with preexisting conditions. He accused Trump of fear-mongering over a group of migrants headed toward the US-Mexico border.
