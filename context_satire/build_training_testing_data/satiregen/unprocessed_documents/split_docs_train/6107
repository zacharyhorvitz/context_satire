 In an attempt to weaken the Syrian government's air power, rebel fighters attacked several military airports across the country Sunday -- including a sprawling base in Idlib province, dissidents said. "Fighter planes have caused many deaths, so we want to end any such thing as military air power," opposition activist Jehad al-Hamwwi told CNN. The rebel Free Syrian Army devised a plan to attack the military airports and the regime's other strategic bases, said Zukan Hded, a dissident in Idlib province. Syrian troops and rebels battled for control of Idlib's Abu al-Zhuhoor military airport, one of the few places in the opposition-dominated province from which government forces can still inflict damage, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. According to Najjar (October 2007), "Iranian missiles are not a threat to any country, and they will only fall on the heads of those who attack Iranian territory." In response to the test of the long-range surface-to-surface Sajil missile, Najjar said it was designed "â€¦for deterrence and to safeguard the stability of the region." Throughout his tenure, Najjar has focused on Iran's military-technological independence and on ensuring the country would not be dependent on the supply of weapons systems from other countries. This was emphasized in his statement upon handing over the reigns of his position to his successor (September 2009):  Syria's president made a rare public appearance Wednesday. Bashar al-Assad visited the Umawyeen Electricity Station at Tishreen Park in Damascus to commemorate Workers' Day. He congratulated the station's staff and all other Syrian workers. The visit came amid more violence in the civil war, a 2-year-old conflict fueled by a grass-roots revolt against the government.
