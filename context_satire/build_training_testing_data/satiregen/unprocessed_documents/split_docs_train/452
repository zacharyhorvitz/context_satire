Another program was then debuted on November 16, 2009, and was hosted by a rotating series of anchors as an interim replacement for Lou Dobbs Tonight following Lou Dobbs' resignation from the network on November 11, 2009. The program featured reporters who filed reports for Lou Dobbs' program, including Dana Bash, Candy Crowley, and Kitty Pilgrim. It was discontinued after January 15, 2010, due to a scheduling shift which occurred the following Monday, extending Rick Sanchez's hour during the CNN Newsroom block into a two-hour program known as Rick's List, which pushed The Situation Room up an hour into Lou Dobbs' former timeslot. On March 22, 2010, the final hour of The Situation Room was replaced by John King, USA, the official replacement for Lou Dobbs Tonight. Kitty Pilgrim was a correspondent for the program, and the most frequent substitute anchor when Dobbs was not on. Other reporters attached to Lou Dobbs Tonight included Dana Bash, Lisa Sylvester, Bill Tucker, Suzanne Malveaux and Casey Wian. The show was broadcast live from CNN's New York studios, located in the Time Warner Center. After his resignation, the show was temporarily replaced by CNN Tonight, a news program hosted by John Roberts and later Erica Hill which featured reports filed by reporters who had filed reports for Lou Dobbs' program. On January 15, 2010, CNN Tonight was displaced by The Situation Room in a scheduling shift as a result of the premiere of Rick's List. John King's new program, John King, USA debuted in Lou Dobbs' timeslot on March 22, 2010.
