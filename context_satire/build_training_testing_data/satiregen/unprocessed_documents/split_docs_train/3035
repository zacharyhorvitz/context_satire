The Transformers: Movie Prequel reveals that in the battle of Tyger Pax, Megatron's forces attack, searching for the All Spark. Bumblebee's squad (which includes Arcee) attempts to hold off the Decepticons, but are eventually overwhelmed. They are captured and tortured by Swindle, with Megatron intervening personally to torture Bumblebee for information. However, they refuse to speak long enough for Prime's secret plan to take effect—launching the AllSpark into outer space. The sequel series, Transformers: Robots in Disguise saw Optimus contacting Bumblebee to warn him of danger on Earth—a prison ship's complement of Decepticon prisoners escaping upon the ship crashing and appearing briefly in physical form to help Bumblebee's unlikely new team defeat the Decepticon Underbite. Optimus appeared throughout the first season as a vision to Bumblebee, though he was only allowed to do so when the latter's need was dire. Residing in the "Realm of the Primes", Optimus Prime began training to combat an "ultimate evil" where his first part of the training was overseen by Micronus Prime. Bumblebee returns in Transformers: The Last Knight, as the last appearance of this incarnation. In the former, he now displays the ability to separate and reassemble himself during combat, as shown when he battles the TRF soldiers in order to protect Cade. He is also revealed to have helped the United States Army Air Force to fight the Nazi Party during World War II, and transformed into a Mercedes-Benz 770. He also regained his voice during his battle with Optimus Prime.
