Collinsworth was born in Dayton, Ohio, the son of Abraham Lincoln "Abe" Collinsworth (who was born on Abraham Lincoln's birthday) and his wife, Donetta Browning Collinsworth. Abe, known as "Lincoln" in high school, was one of the top scorers in Kentucky high school basketball history and played for the Kentucky Wildcats "Fiddling Five" that won the 1958 national championship. Both of Cris's parents were educators; Donetta was a teacher, and Abe was a high school teacher and coach who later became a principal and eventually an assistant superintendent. The family, which also included Collinsworth's brother, moved to Titusville, Florida in 1963, when Cris was four years old. He grew up there and attended Astronaut High School, where his father was the principal. Cris Collinsworth was a high school football All-American quarterback and the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) Class 3A 100-yard-dash state champion for the Astronaut War Eagles in 1976. The Lakeview school district was formed in 1968 in response to Columbus Public Schools deciding for financial reasons to no longer admit non-resident tuition students. Lakeview High School opened in the fall of 1969 and graduated its first class in 1970. In 2009, the district moved seventh- and eighth-graders to the Lakeview High School building and added six classrooms in order to alleviate crowding at its two feeder schools, Shell Creek Elementary and Platte Center Elementary, following the closure and sale of another school, Sunrise Elementary, to Archer Daniels Midland.
