On February 24, 2010, Brancheau performed a 'Dine with Shamu' show with Tilikum, the largest orca at SeaWorld Orlando. In this setting, guests ate at an open-air restaurant while watching the performance poolside as the orca was exercised and fed. As part of the end-of-show routine, she was at the edge of the pool, rubbing Tilikum's head. She was lying with her face next to Tilikum's on a slide-out, which is a platform submerged about a foot into the water. In August 2014, SeaWorld announced it planned to build new killer whale tanks that would be almost double the size of the existing ones to provide more space for its whales, scheduled for completion in 2018. The company maintained the move was not in response to the release of the Blackfish documentary. Wild killer whales may travel up to 160 kilometres (100Â mi) in a day and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. PETA, which opposes whales being kept in captivity has proposed the theme park operator base its whales in seaside sanctuaries. Beginning in 2001 the park was named Six Flags Worlds of Adventure, boasting 750 acres, it became the largest Six Flags park. The property was divided into three sections known as wild life, the former SeaWorld park, wild rides, formerly Geauga Lake, and wild slides, a 10 acre water park, all included in a single gate price. The sale of SeaWorld Cleveland did not include the three current killer whales or the park's dolphins. The killer whale show was replaced by three dolphins from Six Flags Discovery Kingdom until a new killer whale, Shouka, arrived on loan from a park in France.
