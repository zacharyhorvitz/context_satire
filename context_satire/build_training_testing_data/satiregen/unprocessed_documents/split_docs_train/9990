 Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts is threatening to "shut down the Senate" with a Ted Cruz-style filibuster if President Barack Obama tries to thwart the congressional ban on moving Guantanamo Bay detainees into U.S. prisons. "I stopped him once from trying to send the Gitmo terrorists to Leavenworth" prison in Kansas, Roberts said during an event in Topeka, according to Roll Call. "I shall do it again, I shall do it again and if he tries it I will shut down the Senate." The White House denied a Wall Street Journal report that it is considering ways to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, which could lead to detainees being transferred into the continental United States. The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country comprising 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe. Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million, the U.S. is the third most populous country.
