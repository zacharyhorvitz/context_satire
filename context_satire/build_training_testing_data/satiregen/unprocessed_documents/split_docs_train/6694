 Three debates down. Two weeks of campaigning to go. President Barack Obama put Republican challenger Mitt Romney on the defensive on foreign policy in the final presidential debate Monday night, with analysts and an immediate poll giving Obama the victory. With 15 days before the November 6 vote, the candidates now hit the road for the final sprint to Election Day -- focusing on the handful of vital battleground states that could decade the closely contested race.  Afghanistan factored in Monday's third and final presidential debate, which covered foreign policy. At one point, President Barack Obama accused Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney of initially being against a withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan in 2014. The claim: "In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends," Obama said. Fact Check: Romney, Obama and Iraq The facts: As early as last year, Mitt Romney said he agreed with a 2014 withdrawal date.  Both candidates are on the trail again today. Both of them will be in new York City tonight for an annual Catholic Charity Dinner. Yesterday President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were all about the "binders," attacking Mitt Romney for his comments about women in the last debate. Governor Bob McDonnell of Virginia is the Chair of the republican Governor's Association and a Romney campaign supporterÂ weighs in.
