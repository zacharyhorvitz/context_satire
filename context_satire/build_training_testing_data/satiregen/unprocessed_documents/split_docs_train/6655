 Less than three days after his former player was shot to death, New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton publicly blasted gun laws in Louisiana and the United States. "I hate guns," he told USA Today in a phone interview. "I find myself leaning to the right on some issues. But on this issue, I can't wrap my brain around it."  Wenceslaus Billiot, an 89-year-old with suede-soft eyes and a bayou-French accent, asked me to follow him onto the second-story balcony of his stork-legged house here in the southern Louisiana marshland. He held up a broom made of dried palmetto leaves and pointed way off into the distance. See that tiny water tower? he asked.  Tyler Summitt had skyrocketed up the women's college basketball ladder, becoming head coach of Louisiana Tech University's team in his early 20s with lots of promise, and cachet from his pedigree as the son of legendary coach Pat Summitt. Now, the younger Summitt is out of a job and "profoundly disappointed in himself." He announced his resignation Thursday, explaining he was doing so "for engaging in a relationship that has negatively affected people I love, respect and care about most." Summitt did not elaborate on the nature of that relationship, or with whom it was, but did say he hopes now "to repair" others with people close to him.
