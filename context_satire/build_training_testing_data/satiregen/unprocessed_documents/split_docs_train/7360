In 1985, Nabisco was bought by R.J. Reynolds, forming RJR Nabisco. After three years of mixed results, the company became one of the hotspots in the 1980s leveraged buyout mania. The company was in auction with two bidders: F. Ross Johnson, the company's president and CEO, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a private equity partnership. George Myles Cordell Fisher (born 1940 in Anna, Illinois) is an American business executive. He served as the chief executive officer and chairman of Eastman Kodak Company from 1993 to 2000. Prior to joining Kodak, Fisher worked at Motorola, Inc. from 1976 to 1993 and was named president and chief executive officer in 1988 and chairman and CEO in 1990. Prior to joining Motorola, George was involved in research and development at Bell Laboratories for ten years. Johnson negotiated a merger between Standard Brands and Nabisco with Nabisco CEO Bob Schaeberle in 1981. Soon after, Shaeberle left Nabisco, and Johnson took the helm, replacing many Nabisco executives with ones from Standard Brands. After growing restless, he went into talks that led to the Nabisco-RJ Reynolds merger in 1985. He was soon appointed President and CEO of RJR Nabisco.
