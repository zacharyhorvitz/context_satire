Immediately following the September 11 attacks, the statue and Liberty Island were closed to the public. The island reopened at the end of 2001, while the pedestal and statue remained off-limits. The pedestal reopened in August 2004, but the National Park Service announced that visitors could not safely be given access to the statue due to the difficulty of evacuation in an emergency. The Park Service adhered to that position through the remainder of the Bush administration. The statue is situated in Upper New York Bay on Liberty Island south of Ellis Island, which together comprise the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Both islands were ceded by New York to the federal government in 1800. As agreed in an 1834 compact between New York and New Jersey that set the state border at the bay's midpoint, the original islands remain New York territory though located on the New Jersey side of the state line. Liberty Island is one of the islands that are part of the borough of Manhattan in New York.  New York City still hasn't said whether "Fearless Girl" will stay. The bronze statue, which appeared one year ago opposite the iconic charging bull near Wall Street, is guaranteed a place only through Thursday â€” International Women's Day. Natalie Grybauskas, a spokesperson for Mayor Bill de Blasio, told CNN that the statue will probably stay in place for a few more days. Beyond that, she said, the city expects to announce its plans soon.
