 Michigan-based Whirlpool has scored a trade victory that could allow President Trump to limit the number of washing machines sold in the U.S. by Samsung and LG. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) voted 4-0 in Whirlpool's favor on Thursday, ruling that a "surge" of washing machines from Samsung and LG have "seriously injured" domestic manufacturers. "The ITC vote is an important win for American manufacturers and American workers," Whirlpool chairman Jeff Fettig said in a statement. Whirlpool filed its petition with the ITC in May, describing Samsung and LG as "serial violators" of U.S. trade law and seeking protection under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. In 1992, Dodge moved their performance orientation forward substantially with the Viper, which featured an aluminum V10 engine and composite sports roadster body. This was the first step in what was marketed as "The New Dodge", which was an aggressive advertising campaign with a litany of new models, with television ads narrated by Edward Herrmann that pointed out the innovations in the vehicles and challenged their competitors. Also,he would go on to serve as the brand's spokesperson for the rest of the decade. They followed up on this idea in a smaller scale with the Neon and Stratus. The Dodge Stratus was the middle entry of the Chrysler JA platform (with the Cirrus being the higher-end model and the Breeze being the lower-end model). The three cars differed only in the front fascia, rear bumper, taillights, and wheels. The interiors also had little variation between the three models; being almost identical, save for the name on the steering wheel, and a few available options.
