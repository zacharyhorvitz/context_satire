 The Senate rejected a proposal from Republican lawmakers to repeal Obamacare on Wednesday, marking a significant milestone in the Republican Party's years-long political crusade to gut former President Barack Obama's legacy health care law. The vote was 45-55, with seven Republicans opposing the measure. The failed effort was a remarkable contrast from less than two years ago, when a Republican-controlled House and Senate passed an identical measure and sent it to Obama. He vetoed the bill.  Senate Republicans are finally voting to repeal Obamacare. But the effort has splintered, with the chamber's leaders pushing multiple ways to get the job done. The Senate narrowly approved a motion to begin the health care debate on Tuesday. Hours later, the Senate failed to approve one repeal and replace bill that would have included a controversial amendment pushed by Texas Senator Ted Cruz.  The latest, last-ditch effort by Senate Republicans to overturn the Affordable Care Act -- the so-called "skinny repeal" --  gives Democrats a golden opportunity to begin redefining their party as a reliable champion of the bread-and-butter economic issues that working-class voters care about. Republican attempts to dismantle Obamacare have ground to a near halt as the nation absorbs the implications of undoing the current law's dense web of federal subsidies of medical services that insurers are legally required to cover. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, ripping away the subsidies and loosening mandatory requirements could add 16 million people to the rolls of the uninsured. But Republican leaders are determined to press ahead, using a strategy that treats repeal efforts as a budgetary matter, which, under Senate rules, requires passage by a simple 50-vote majority rather than an all-but-impossible 60 votes.
