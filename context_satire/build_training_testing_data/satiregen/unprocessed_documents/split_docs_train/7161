 Dylan Farrow broke down in tears in her first televised interview and said she wishes her father, director Woody Allen, had been charged with assaulting her. "He's lying and he's been lying for so long," she said after watching a clip of a 1992 "60 Minutes" interview in which Allen denied abusing her. "It is difficult for me to see him and to hear his voice." Farrow, 32, sat down with Gayle King for an interview that aired on "CBS This Morning" on Thursday and provided graphic details about how Allen allegedly sexually assaulted her when she was seven years old.  Is it #TimesUp for famed director Woody Allen? In the wake of the #MeToo movement and Time's Up campaign, which have focused attention on the treatment of women, the list of actors who have denounced the famed director is growing. The most recent actor to do so is Colin Firth, who appeared in Allen's 2013 film "Magic in the Moonlight." "I wouldn't work with him again," Firth told The Guardian on Thursday.  The young actor set to star in Woody Allen's next film says that he will donate his entire salary from that movie to charity amid questions about longstanding sexual abuse claims against Allen. Timothee Chalamet announced in an Instagram post Monday night that he was "learning that a good role isn't the only criteria for accepting a job." "I don't want to profit from my work on the film, and to that end, I am going to donate my entire salary," he said. Chalamet said that he had been asked "in a few recent interviews" about the film, "A Rainy Day in New York," but was unable to answer because of "contractual obligations."
