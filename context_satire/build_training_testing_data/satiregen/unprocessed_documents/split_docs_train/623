 North Korea's announcement that it successfully conducted a hydrogen bomb test caught the world by surprise -- and raised a slew of questions about what this disturbing development means. Here are the answers to seven key questions:  What's the difference between an H-bomb and an atomic bomb? A hydrogen bomb is much more powerful -- more powerful than anything North Korea has tested before. The tests North Korea conducted until now used fission weapons, which break large atoms like plutonium, into smaller atoms.  LATEST UPDATES: Click here to see the most recent developments on this story  North Korea says it has successfully carried out a hydrogen bomb test, which if confirmed, will be a first for the reclusive regime and a significant advancement for its military ambitions. A hydrogen bomb is more powerful than plutonium weapons, which is what North Korea used in its three previous underground nuclear tests. "If there's no invasion on our sovereignty we will not use nuclear weapon," the North Korean state news agency said. "This H-bomb test brings us to a higher level of nuclear power."  The House of Representatives is expected to vote on new economic sanctions on North Korea, on the heels of its claim to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb this week. A vote is scheduled for Tuesday, according to House leadership. The legislation, sponsored by House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce of California and Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the top Democrat on the panel, would curtail North Korea's access to U.S. financial markets, targeting banks that may be supporting North Korea's arms, money-laundering or smuggling operations. It would also authorize the U.S. to sanction others who are facilitating or transferring assets to North Korea, penalize cybercrimes and crack down on human rights abuses.
