Childhood friends from Jackson, Mississippi, Hubbard and Clay Jones both moved to Oxford to study literature at the University of Mississippi, where they subsequently met violinist Helena Lamb. The three began working on songs that Hubbard had written that didn't fit into their previous bands. Hubbard, Jones and Lamb adopted the name Spoon and recorded their first song, "Say Something Warm", in one day. Soon after, they began playing live as a trio in bars, coffee houses, college lunch rooms and restaurants. Dianetic auditing is one way by which the Scientologist may progress toward the Clear state, winning gradual freedom from the reactive mind's engrams and acquiring certainty of his or her reality as a thetan. David V. Barrett, a sociologist of religion who has written widely about the subject, says that according to Scientology, the "first major goal is to go Clear." Clearing was described to represent "the attainment of Man's dreams through the ages of attaining a new and higher state of existence and freedom from the endless cycle of birth, death, birth â€¦ Clear is the total erasure of the reactive mind from which stems all the anxieties and problems the individual has." Hubbard grew up in a climate that was very critical of organized religion, and frequently quoted anti-religious sentiments in his early lectures. The scholar Marco Frenschkowski (University of Mainz) has stated that it was not easy for Hubbard "to come to terms with the spiritual side of his own movement. Hubbard did not want to found a religion: he discovered that what he was talking about in fact was religion. This mainly happened when he had to deal with apparent memories from former lives.
