 Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has agreed to a "period of transition" while details of a more "independent" role for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are hammered out. After a crisis meeting of senior royals at the Queen's Sandringham estate north of London, the Queen said she had agreed that Prince Harry and Meghan could split their time between the UK and Canada but that "complex matters" would have to be resolved. The monarch said she had ordered final plans to be drawn up in the next few days. The highly unusual meeting was called after the couple's bombshell announcement last week that they wished to step back from their roles as senior members of the royal family.  The British royal family will meet Monday to discuss the future of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex after the couple announced this week they would step back from their roles as senior members of the royal family, a palace source told CNN. Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry will attend the meeting at the Queen's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, eastern England, the source said. Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is expected to call in to the meeting from Canada. Meanwhile, Prince William has expressed his "sadness" over the rift with his brother Prince Harry and that the royal family was no longer "a team," the UK's Sunday Times reported, citing a friend.  Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, did not dial into the crisis meeting called by Queen Elizabeth II on Monday, a royal source told CNN Tuesday. She had been expected to call in to the meeting with the Queen and Princes Charles, William and Harry about the Sussexes' decision to step back from senior royal duties. In the end, the Sussexes decided it was not necessary for her to join the discussion, the source said. The meeting was held at the Queen's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, some 100 miles north of London, and Meghan is currently in Canada, with the couple's baby son Archie.
