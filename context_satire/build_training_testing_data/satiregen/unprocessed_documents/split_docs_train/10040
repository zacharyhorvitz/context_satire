 Karachi isn't a city you'd often see on the silver screen. It isn't "pretty"; descriptions of it usually harp on the doom and gloom of terror, crime and death. It's erratic, sometimes insufferable and often torments those who love it. But this city, home to almost 27 million people, also has a tenacity said to be representative of Pakistan's stubborn pluck -- the soul of the nation, if you will.
