 More than one year after the death Justice Antonin Scalia, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold its first hearing for a nominee to succeed him on the Supreme Court. Judge Neil Gorsuch will appear Monday before senators looking to pin him down on his philosophy -- and some will air grievances about why Gorsuch is even here at all. Gorsuch, for his part, will try to defend his approach without discussing specific cases or damaging his smooth nomination in any way. The Judiciary Committee has four days of hearings scheduled.  A Democratic lawmaker said Monday his party is prepared to use "every tool" possible to keep Judge Neil Gorsuch from making it to the Supreme Court. "I think that that every nominee is important. If I conclude this one is outside the mainstream, I will use every tool at my disposal and I think my Democratic colleagues share that view," Sen. Richard Blumenthal told CNN's Poppy Harlow on "New Day." Gorsuch will appear before senators later Monday looking to pin him down on his conservative philosophy.  Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch came to the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday prepared to deliver a clear message: I'm a judge, not a politician. He stressed on several occasions that he is independent from the President who has appointed him, that as a judge he "doesn't give a whit" about politics, and that he treats his plaintiffs fairly. Sitting at a small table, he turned to listen to each senator as they spoke, hour after hour, carefully writing notes before launching into his replies. The questions -- even on hot-button issues such as abortion, the travel ban and controversial Supreme Court opinions -- never rattled him.
