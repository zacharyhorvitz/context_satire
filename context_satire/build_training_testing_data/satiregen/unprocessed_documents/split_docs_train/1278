When Carlson was 22, he got a job working as a "copy boy" for night city editor, Glenn Binford, at the LA Times. There, he met and befriended Carl Lance Brisson, the son of actress, Rosalind Russell. Shelly is a waitress who dropped out of high school to marry the trucker Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re), who she had fallen for after he gave her attention. Once they got married, however, she realized Leo just "wanted a maid he didn't have to pay for", and that he became abusive whenever he didn't get his way. Shelly has been having an affair with Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook), Laura's boyfriend. Leo finds out, and attempts to kill Shelly by tying her up inside the Packard Saw Mill and setting it on fire. Carlson referred to the 2020 assassination of Qasem Soleimani as a "quagmire." He criticized the "chest-beaters" who promote foreign interventions, particularly Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE), and asked, "By the way, if we're still in Afghanistan, 19 years, sad years, later, what makes us think there's a quick way out of Iran?"
