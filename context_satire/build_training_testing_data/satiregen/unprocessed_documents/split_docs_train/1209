Chol (Hebrew: חוֹל‎), in most passages of the Hebrew Bible, is a word for sand. The Leningrad Codex reads:אֹמַר עִם־קִנִּ֣י אֶגְוָ֑ע וְ֝כַח֗וֹל אַרְבֶּ֥ה יָמִֽים׃’omar ‘im-qinni ’egva‘; vekhachol, ’arbeh yamim. In the Greek Septuagint (circa 200 BCE), the translators used the Ancient Greek expression στέλεχος φοίνικος (stélechos phoínikos, "stem/trunk of a palm tree") when they reached the Hebrew chol in Job 29. Similarly, the Latin Vulgate (circa 400 CE), uses palma (Latin for "palm tree").A number of English translations use the term "phoenix" in this verse, while the King James Version and the German language Luther Bible use "Sand".In the New Revised Standard Version this reads:Then I thought, ‘I shall die in my nest,    and I shall multiply my days like the phoenix;Modern scholars have differed in their understanding of Job 29:18. This list is sorted by MONA number (MONA is short for Moths of America North of Mexico). A numbering system for North American moths introduced by Ronald W. Hodges et al. in 1983 in the publication Check List of the Lepidoptera of America North of Mexico. The list has since been updated, but the placement in families is outdated for some species. The list is sorted by the country of origin of the authors, although they may have published, or now be resident in other countries.
