 The rebooted MTV Movie and TV Awards, which now honors both big and small projects, debuted on Sunday night. The show was hosted by comedian and actor Adam DeVine, who kicked things off with an over-the-top musical number from "Beauty and the Beast." Actress Emma Watson, who starred in the Disney blockbuster, won the night's award for best actor. "I think I'm being given this award because of who Belle is and what she represents.  It's time for Emma Swan's swan song on "Once Upon a Time." Jennifer Morrison has announced she plans to depart the ABC fantasy series after its current sixth season. "After very careful consideration, I have decided that creatively and personally, it is time for me to move on," Morrison said in a note posted to Instagram. "Once Upon a Time" has not yet officially been ordered for a seventh season, but there have been reports that ABC was considering renewing and retooling the series, with Morrison's character and three other regulars (Lana Parrilla, Robert Carlyle and Colin O'Donoghue) at the center.  Mixed in with the star sightings and Golden Popcorn trophies at Sunday's MTV Movie and TV Awards will be a bit of messaging. In addition to adding television content to competition, the show has added two new categories for entertainment highlighting social justice issues and activism.
