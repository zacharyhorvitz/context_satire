The Los Angeles Police Department is world-renowned for its training. Officers on the Department receive the best academic, tactical and physical conditioning in the field. However, as with almost any profession, there are still some hazards associated with the job. On February 7, 2008, when LAPD responded to a call that an emotionally disturbed man killed three of his family members, the man shot two SWAT officers, one of whom was killed. The Los Angeles Police Department has suffered from chronic underfunding and under-staffing in recent years. Compared to most other major cities in the United States, and though it is the third largest police department in the country, Los Angeles has historically had one of the lowest ratios of police personnel to population served. Former police chief William J. Bratton made enlarging the department one of his top priorities (Bratton has been quoted as saying, "You give me 4,000 more officers and I'll give you the safest city in the world"). As noted, after the verdicts were announced, a crowd of protesters formed at the Los Angeles police headquarters at Parker Center in Downtown Los Angeles. The crowd grew as the afternoon passed, and became violent. The police formed a skirmish line to protect the building, sometimes moving as protesters advanced. In the midst of this, before 6:30Â p.m., police chief Daryl Gates left Parker Center, on his way to the neighborhood of Brentwood.
