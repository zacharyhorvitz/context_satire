 President Barack Obama indicated a willingness Wednesday to agree to a short-term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit, if Republicans will accept it, a Democratic lawmaker told CNN. The president signaled more "give" to the idea of a six-week deal to hike the debt ceiling during a private White House meeting with House Democrats, said the lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The revelation comes amid a stalemate that has Republicans trying to use spending and debt limit deadlines as leverage to wring concessions from Obama and Democrats. The result of the political standoff has been a partial government shutdown that is in its second week and fears of a possible U.S. default on its debt that economists warn could cause another recession.  In a large conference-style room in the basement of the U.S. Capitol, Republican members of the House, exhausted from more than two weeks of battling on the shutdown and debt ceiling crisis, met for one last time. They met in a room that had often been filled with contentious debate, snickering rebels, quiet observers and frustrated moderators. But on the night the House voted to reopen the government, the mood was different. They knew it was over.  After 24 hectic hours, Congress was back where it started Tuesday night -- with Republicans and Democrats in the Senate near a deal to end to the U.S. budget standoff, while House Republicans can't agree among themselves. Meanwhile the U.S. government is creeping closer to potentially defaulting on its debt, something the Treasury Department says will happen Thursday if there's no pact to hike the nation's borrowing limit. To this point, the Wall Street bond-rating firm Fitch has warned of a downgrade of gold-plated U.S. bonds, citing the default risk from "political brinkmanship." The economic nightmare from the possible debt default could compound the pain tied to the ongoing partial government shutdown, which enters its 16th day on Wednesday.
