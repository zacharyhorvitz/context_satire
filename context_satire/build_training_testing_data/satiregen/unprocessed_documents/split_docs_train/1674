The Men's Gymnasium served as the home of the basketball team from 1917â€“1928. After the first few games spectators complained that they couldn't see the game because of opaque wooden backboards. As a result, the Nurre Mirror Plate Company in Bloomington was employed to create new backboards that contained one-and-a-half inch thick plate glass so that fans could see games without an obstructed view. As a result, it was the first facility in the country to use glass backboards. As part of the new Indiana State Master Plan, Fairbanks Hall will receive a comprehensive study to determine a new use of the space. It is a historically significant structure and will continue to be used by the university. During the Great Depression, Indiana University fared much better than most state schools thanks to the entrepreneurship of its young president Herman Wells. He collaborated with Frederick L. Hovde, the president of IU's cross-state rival, Purdue; together they approached the Indiana delegation to Congress, indicating their highest priorities. For Wells, it was to build a world-class music school, replacing dilapidated facilities. As a result of these efforts, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) built one of the finest facilities in the country.
