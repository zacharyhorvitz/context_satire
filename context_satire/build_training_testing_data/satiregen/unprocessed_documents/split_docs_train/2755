Kingdom Come is the ninth studio album by American rapper Jay-Z. It was released on November 21, 2006, by Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. It was considered a "comeback album" for the rapper, as 2003's The Black Album was promoted as his final release. Kingdom Come received generally lukewarm reviews but was a commercial success, selling 680,000 copies in its first week, while earning Jay-Z a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap Album. Closing out the year, Magna Carta Holy Grail was met with many accolades and was named in multiple "Albums of the Year" lists by major publications. It was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards and for Best Rap Album at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. Complex ranked the album at number 23, on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They praised the "high-gloss production," and strong rhymes by Jay-Z, deeming it "very listenable". Watch the Throne was nominated for Grammy Awards for Best Rap Album and Best Recording Package, presented at the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012. It lost the award to West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, which took home three of the awards for which it was nominated. The song "Otis" was nominated for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song, winning the former. "Otis" lost the latter award to West's Twisted Fantasy single "All of the Lights".
