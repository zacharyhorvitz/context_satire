Hegdish (performed by Dan Redican) is a trickster, a rival, a grouch, and the show's only main antagonist. He was added in the second season. He wears a brown scarf and has shaggy purple fur, large black eyebrows (which makes the top of his head appear bald), and heavily ringed yellow eyes. Cynical, pessimistic, sarcastic and lazy (In many episodes he is shown sleeping in a hammock in the middle of the day), he sometimes makes the effort to horde the things he likes, trip up the plans of the other Groundlings, give misleading information, and waste resources. Before he starred in Home Improvement, he appeared in local print and television advertising in Denver. He then appeared at a showcase in New York City, directed by Peter Sklar, where he was seen by a professional talent representative. This, and his interest in acting soon brought him to California, where he was cast in the role of Brad, the oldest Taylor child, in the show Home Improvement. His character was known for experimenting with different hair styles as well as being the child most often in trouble. After the 1976 tour, Townshend took most of the following year off to spend time with his family. He discovered that former Beatles and Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein had bought a stake in his publishing company. A settlement was reached, but Townshend was upset and disillusioned that Klein had attempted to take ownership of his songs. Townshend went to the Speakeasy where he met the Sex Pistols' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, fans of the Who.
