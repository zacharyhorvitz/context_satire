 A United Airlines 787 Dreamliner was diverted due to a mechanical problem, the third such incident for Dreamliners in six days. United Flight 94 was on its way to Denver early Sunday when it was forced to fly back to the Houston airport where the flight had originated, United Airlines said. The cause: an issue with the brake indicator. The plane landed without incident and with no passenger injuries, said Boeing, which makes the Dreamliner.  The funnel cloud approached Denver International Airport from the south, not unlike a commercial airliner. But thankfully, the tornado hit right between the two runways on the airport's east side and did not cause any damage. "It's really lucky that it didn't hit the parking area or concourse," National Weather Service meteorologist Kyle Fredin said. The twister, which was caught on camera, looked menacing, but everything returned to normal  shortly afterward, airport officials said.  A pair of large passenger jets passed alarmingly close to each other in the busy skies over New York, the FAA said Friday. Although the Delta Boeing 747 and Shuttle America Embraer E170 landed safely, the June 13 incident has triggered an FAA investigation, the agency said. It happened about 2,000 feet above the borough of Queens, the FAA said, as the 747 Jumbo Jet was approaching John F. Kennedy International Airport and shortly after the E170 had taken off from nearby LaGuardia Airport. Both planes were turning away from each other at the point where they "lost the required separation," an FAA spokeswoman said.
