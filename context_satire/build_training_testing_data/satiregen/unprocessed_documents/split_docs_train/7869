Idaho was admitted to the Union on July 3, 1890. Since then, the state has had 32 governors, two of whom served non-consecutive terms. The terms for governor and lieutenant governor are four years, commencing on the first Monday in the January following the election. Prior to 1946, the offices were elected to terms of two years. The governor of Idaho serves a four-year term, and is elected during what is nationally referred to as midterm elections. As such, the governor is not elected in the same election year as the president of the United States. The current governor is Republican Brad Little, who was elected in 2018. The Governor of Idaho is the head of the executive branch of Idaho's state government and commander-in-chief of the state's military forces. The governor has the duty to see state laws are executed, power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Idaho Legislature.
