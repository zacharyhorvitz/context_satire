 On the night vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan made his debut on the national stage, the GOP turned its attention to America's influence abroad and what the party sees as President Barack Obama's failed economic policies. The roster of speakers at the Republican National Convention boasted two of the party's foreign policy heavy hitters and rhetoric designed to appeal to voters who are still undecided. Here are five things we learned from the convention's second night: 1. Romney's enforcer comes to play  On Tuesday, the GOP convention was about love (Ann Romney) and respect (Chris Christie).  The former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, talks with Soledad O'Brien on "Starting Point" this morning, live from Tampa at the site of the Republican National Convention. The former GOP presidential front runner is lending his support and his delegates to Mitt Romney. Gingrich addresses one of the big questions at the convention, as to whether presidential candidate Ron Paul will release his delegates. Gingrich explains to Soledad that he thinks Paul delegates will be very supportive of Romney.  Though all eyes are on hurricane Isaac as it nears the Gulf Coast, there's also a Republican National Convention going on and next week the Democratic National Convention will take place in Charlotte, North Carolina. There's one man who is trying to bring both parties together in a very unique way. TV personality Ty Pennington explains to Soledad and John on "Starting Point." As part of Craftsman House United, Pennington will lead the charge to build one half of a home during the Republican National Convention in Tampa today, and the other half of the home will be built during the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte on Monday, September 3.
