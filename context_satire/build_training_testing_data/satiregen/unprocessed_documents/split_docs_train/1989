In this conceit, Fallon sets up the premise that he had found an angry man ranting on the street and wants to give the man an opportunity to vent and get his complaints off his chest. Leno then comes in and gives his monologue in the form of a rant, finishing by storming off the set in a rage, sometimes knocking down a staffer on his way out the door. The fictional love story between Emily Hudson, the daughter of the wagon train's pastor, and Jonathan Samuelson, the son of the local Mormon bishop, plays out against the build-up to the tragedy itself. The film begins with the deposition of Mormon leader Brigham Young. The Bakerâ€“Fancher party is then depicted crossing Utah on its way to California. The party encounters a group of Mormon militiamen, who advise them to move on. In a light-hearted attempt to reclaim the honor of his The Proposal co-star Betty White, who at the time was the only celebrity Jimmy had defeated in beer pong, Ryan Reynolds played Jimmy in a game of beer shuffleboard. The two later played another game after a dispute arose over an interpretation of the rules of the game.
