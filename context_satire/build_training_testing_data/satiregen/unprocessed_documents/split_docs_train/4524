In "Weight Loss", Andy continually pesters Angela with ideas for their wedding. Most of his proposals are outlandish and expensive, and Angela continues to treat him and his ideas with contempt. She pages Dwight, and they meet in the Dunder Mifflin warehouse to have sex. This seems to be a habit, but later in the episode Andy tells Angela he doesn't care where they marry so long as they're together. However, the truth is eventually revealed in "The Duel", when Michael decides to take the matter into his own hands, much to the objection of the staff by telling Andy the news. Devastated, Andy confronts Angela who tries to squirm her way out of the confrontation before admitting to the affair. This only sparks a duel between Andy and Dwight which seems to arouse Angela because of two men fighting over her. But that is short-lived when Andy tells Dwight that he slept with her twice in comparison to how many times Dwight has slept with her. Up until Season 5, Angela is the head of the Party Planning Committee along with Phyllis as her assistant. Angela is patronizing and bossy towards Phyllis, who admits that Angela is hard to deal with and that the two have a severe disliking towards one another. In "Goodbye Toby", Phyllis catches Angela and Dwight having sex in the back of the office (thus cheating on her fianc√© at the time) and uses this to blackmail Angela and make her do what she wants. In "New Leads", Michael gives Angela Phyllis' leads, and Angela, in retaliation for all the aggravating tasks she had to endure while under her control, makes her do some accounting work only to shred it later.
