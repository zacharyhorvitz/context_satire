 Americans will see a preview of what could be the general election matchup when the Democratic and Republican front-runners make pitches to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee audience later this month. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are now scheduled to address the conference hosted by AIPAC, the leading pro-Israel lobby in Washington, from March 20 to March 22, the organization said Friday. AIPAC did not specify the dates on which the candidates will speak. Trump and Clinton have rarely spoken to the same audiences so far in the campaign.  Allies of Hillary Clinton are calling out Bernie Sanders for snapping at the former secretary of state in a pair of tense exchanges during the Democratic presidential debate on Sunday night in Flint, Michigan. "Excuse me, I'm talking," Sanders told Clinton as she attempted to interrupt his argument about the Wall Street and auto bailouts. Correct the Record, an independent group that backs Clinton's campaign, emailed the clip to reporters, describing it as Sanders' "Rick Lazio moment." That's a reference to former New York senate candidate Rick Lazio, then a Republican congressman, who in a 2000 debate with Clinton walked across the stage demanding she sign a campaign finance reform pledge. On November 12, 2007, the New York Times reported that "At two campaign events in Iowa this year, aides to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton encouraged audience members to ask her specific questions, a tactic that drew criticism from an opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination and led her yesterday to promise that it would not happen again." In response, Clinton remarked, 'It was news to me  and neither I nor my campaign approve of that, and it will certainly not be tolerated.'"
