 How best to capture the politics of the moment? With a cover photo, naturally. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump tweeted a photo that he used in an attempt to mock House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The President and Pelosi had engaged in a contentious White House meeting earlier that day on the unfolding crisis in Syria.  Sen. Kamala Harris on Wednesday defended her calls for Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump's account, a plan she reiterated on stage at the fourth Democratic primary presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times. Harris first made her call following the President's tweets about the whistleblower complaint at the center of the Ukraine scandal. During Tuesday night's debate, Harris called out Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the field's front-runners, for not following her lead in saying Trump's Twitter account should be taken down. Warren brushed off Harris' proposal, saying she didn't just want to "push Trump off Twitter" but also out of the White House.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday redirected an attack from President Donald Trump on Twitter, turning a photo he had tweeted of her during a contentious White House meeting with the caption "Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown!" into her Twitter cover shot. The image released by the White House shows the California Democrat standing with her finger pointed at a seated Trump during a meeting in which congressional Democratic leaders said the President had a "meltdown." Pelosi's deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill noted the change on Twitter, writing, "Thanks for the new cover photo @realDonaldTrump!"
