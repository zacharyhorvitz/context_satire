There are two recent cases that are related to the Frisbie v Collins case, in that the Ker Frisbie Doctrine apply. The first of them being United States v. Yunis, which was decided in 1991. This case's defendant, Yunis, was convicted of conspiracy, aircraft piracy, and hostage taking. Yunis plus four other men hijacked a plane on its way to Beirut, Lebanon, carrying various military level weapons. The Frisbie v. Collins case involved terms and laws. Two laws are the Federal Kidnapping Act and the Fourteenth Amendment (due process of law). The Federal Kidnapping Act, or otherwise known at the Lindbergh Law or the Little Lindbergh Law, states that if kidnappers cross state lines then Federal law enforcement can get involved. The Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment states that as “A fundamental, constitutional guarantee that all legal proceedings will be fair and that one will be given notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard before the government acts to take away one's life, liberty, or property.” In the case of Frisbie v. Collins, the apparent violation was due to how the authorities abducted Shirley Collins, forcibly taking him from Chicago back to Michigan to be tried for murder. From these two cases a new doctrine was created called the Ker-Frisbie Doctrine. Overall it states that criminal defendants that are being tried have to be in court, and it does not matter how the authorities get them there. This has been and is used in both domestic and international cases to defend the abduction and extradition by authorities. However, over the years while courts have continued to uphold and use the doctrine itself, limitations on it have been created.
