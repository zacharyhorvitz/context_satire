18 years pass and urban legend fuses into reality as a group of teenagers headed by Elias Sanchez again tell the story of Camila. Playfully, they claim that on the day of the blood moon eclipse, the ghost of Camila will possess a new body and kickstart her vow for revenge. As if fulfilling the prophecy, a girl from nowhere, Emma Bonaobra moves to the town. Securing a job as the town's mortuary cosmetologist, she is told of the tale of The Killer Bride but disbelieves it. Ten years later, this dream comes true as Leah gets her visa to compete in a choir competition in San Francisco, California. After the contest, Leah extends her stay in San Francisco with the intention of visiting her mother's grave, and to find a way to legally work in the United States. However to her surprise, Leah does not find her mother's grave, and as her visa expires, finding a job that will allow her to remain in the United States also becomes elusive. BidaMan is a talent search looking for ABS-CBN's next leading man actor. The competition is open to 20 to 35 year-old good-looking men. The winning BidaMan of the week receives ₱20,000 and advances to The Big Break. The first Ultimate BidaMan will take home ₱1,000,000, management and movie contract, a brand new pick-up truck, and a brand new house and lot.
