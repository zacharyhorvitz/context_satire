 Anthony Scaramucci is set on living his best life. After five days working at the White House, the shortest-lived communications director stint in history, Scaramucci told TMZ while departing the Trump International Hotel in Washington Tuesday that he's "working on being the best person I can be." Scaramucci's comments come a day after he was pushed out from his White House gig. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the move was in order to "give chief of staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team."  Anthony Scaramucci is out as White House communications director, the latest sign of chaos inside the Trump administration. Scaramucci's ouster is the most recent high-profile departure from the Trump White House. Chief of Staff Reince Priebus resigned at the end of last week, replaced by John Kelly, whose first day is Monday. "Anthony Scaramucci will be leaving his role as White House Communications Director," White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement Monday afternoon.  Sean Spicer said Friday night that President Donald Trump did not want him to resign as White House press secretary but "understood" that it was in the best interest of the administration. Speaking to Fox News' Sean Hannity, Spicer said that while he had previously considered resigning, it was his decision alone to leave his post as press secretary and give it over to a new communications team under Anthony Scaramucci, who was named the new White House communications director, and deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who will be taking over the press secretary position. The White House announced Spicer's resignation earlier on Friday. "He's been very gracious throughout this process," Spicer said of Trump.
