In a small town, Charlie Bucket, a poor paperboy, watches kids visit a candy shop. Walking home, he passes Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. A mysterious tinker recites the first lines of William Allingham's poem "The Fairies", and tells Charlie that "nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out". Charlie rushes home to his widowed mother and bedridden grandparents. The idea for adapting the book into a film came about when director Mel Stuart's ten-year-old daughter read the book and asked her father to make a film out of it, with "Uncle Dave" (producer David L. Wolper who was not related to the Stuarts) producing it. Stuart showed the book to Wolper, who happened to be in the midst of talks with the Quaker Oats Company regarding a vehicle to introduce a new candy bar from its Chicago-based Breaker Confections subsidiary (since renamed the Willy Wonka Candy Company and sold to Nestl√©). Wolper persuaded the company, which had no previous experience in the film industry, to buy the rights to the book and finance the picture for the purpose of promoting a new Quaker Oats Wonka Bar. As the tour ends, Charlie and Joe, the only two remaining, ask about the other kids, and Wonka assures them that that they will be restored to normal before retreating to his office, without awarding them the promised lifetime supply of chocolate. Grandpa Joe and Charlie enter his office to ask about this, and Wonka angrily informs them that by "stealing" Fizzy Lifting Drinks, they violated the contract, thereby forfeiting their prize. Joe suggests to Charlie that he give Slugworth the Gobstopper in revenge, but Charlie returns the candy to Wonka. Wonka declares Charlie the winner, and reveals that "Slugworth" was his employee Mr. Wilkinson; the offer to buy the Gobstopper was a morality test that only Charlie passed.
