Larry's friend, comedian Richard Lewis, is in dire need of a kidney transplant operation.

Larry then makes many concerted, ridiculous efforts to find Richard another kidney donor.

TiVo pioneered recording programs based on household viewing habits; this is called TiVo Suggestions. Users can rate programs from three "thumbs up" to three "thumbs down". TiVo user ratings are combined to create a recommendation, based on what TiVo users with similar viewing habits watch. For example, if one user likes American Idol, America's Got Talent and Dancing with the Stars, then another TiVo user who watched just American Idol might get a recommendation for the other two shows.
