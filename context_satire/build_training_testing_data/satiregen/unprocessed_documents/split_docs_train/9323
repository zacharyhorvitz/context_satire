In June 2016, it was announced that Gibson had begun work on a sequel to The Passion of the Christ focused on the resurrection of Jesus. Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay for Braveheart (1995) was also penned as screenwriter. In September, Gibson expressed his interest in directing it. He estimated that the film would be released in a few years, as it is a big project. As Jesus awaits crucifixion, he is haunted by the ghost of Judas, who asks why Jesus chose to arrive in the manner and time that he did, and if it was all part of a divine plan ("Superstar"). Jesus is crucified, recites his final words and dies ("The Crucifixion"). In The Passion: Photography from the Movie "The Passion of the Christ", director Mel Gibson says, "This is a movie about love, hope, faith and forgiveness. Jesus died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts.
