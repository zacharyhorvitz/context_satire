 Mitt Romney on Saturday announced U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate for the White House -- a bold and risky move that energized both conservatives and their opponents. Ryan is a rising Republican star and the party's leader on fiscal and budget issues. He said he is overwhelmed by the reaction to the announcement that he is Romney's running mate. "I was amazed at the energy, the crowd, people who just want to see us take the country in a different direction," Ryan said.  For both presidential campaigns, Republican Mitt Romney's choice of Wisconsin congressman and conservative star Paul Ryan as his running mate was like Christmas come early. Conservatives wanted one of their own on Romney's ticket and they got that in Ryan, who has emerged as their ideological leader on the Hill on fiscal and budget matters. The choice also helps satisfy Republican strategists who felt Romney needed to not only stress how President Barack Obama has failed in that role, but also better articulate what the GOP candidate would do if elected. "Ryan is a great choice.  The 2012 presidential campaign returned its focus to Iowa on Monday as President Barack Obama and Rep. Paul Ryan, the newly minted GOP vice presidential candidate, stumped in the electoral battleground. Elsewhere, Mitt Romney continued his campaign bus tour at events in Florida and Vice President Joe Biden was slated to rally in North Carolina, making Monday the first day all four candidates vying for president and vice president hit the trail. The focus for all four remained on Ryan, who was unveiled as Romney's running mate at a Saturday morning event in Virginia. A CNN/ORC poll taken at the beginning of August showed a majority of Americans were unfamiliar with Ryan, leaving an opening for both Democrats and Republicans to offer their own definitions of the seven-term Wisconsin congressman.
