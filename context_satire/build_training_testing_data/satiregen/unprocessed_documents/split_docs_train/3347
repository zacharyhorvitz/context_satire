 Visitors be warned: Security around the White House about to intensify. In the wake of last week's unprecedented security breach, the Secret Service is planning to increase surveillance around 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has ordered a full review of Friday's incident. Omar Gonzalez, an Iraq war veteran, is accused of carrying a small knife, scaling the White House fence, sprinting roughly 70 yards across the North Lawn and making it pass the North Portico doors, which were not locked. The White House "beat" concept that had been started during the Cleveland administration by reporter William Price was continued during the McKinley administration. Around the time of the outbreak of the Spanishâ€“American War in 1898, the reporters covering the White House were invited into the mansion itself and provided with space to write, conduct interviews, and generally cover the White House. Now reporting from inside the White House, the reporters used their new location to interview guests entering or leaving the White House or confirm pieces of information from the president's secretaries as they passed through in the course of their duties. Reporters working in the White House did, however, honor an unspoken rule and refrain from asking the president himself a question if he happened to walk through their working area. At the end of the Cleveland administration, a new feature of press coverage of the White House materialized. William W. Price, a southern reporter, auditioned for a job at the Washington Evening Star by stationing himself at the White House to seek out stories. He interviewed guests coming and going from meetings or events with the president and ultimately reported a story in a piece carrying the headline "At the White House". Competitor newspapers responded by sending their own reporters to cover the White House in a daily, sustained way and soon the White House had reporters dedicated to covering the "White House beat."
