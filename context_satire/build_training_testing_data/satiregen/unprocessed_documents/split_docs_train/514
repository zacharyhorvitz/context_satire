 U.S. agents disrupted an Iranian assassination-for-hire scheme targeting Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, U.S. officials said Tuesday. Elements of the Iranian government directed the alleged plan, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said. A naturalized U.S. citizen holding Iranian and U.S. passports and a member of Iran's Revolutionary Guard face conspiracy charges connected with the plot. "In addition to holding these individual conspirators accountable for their alleged role in this plot, the United States is committed to holding Iran accountable for its actions," Holder said.  As Saudi women artists, Reem Al Faisal and Lulwah Al Homoud, feel they are fighting against multiple stereotypes. They are caught between conservative attitudes at home and western critics who expect them to address women's rights in their work. "They want you to talk about very limited things like sexual oppression, search for identity and if you don't fit these criteria you're excluded and you are not considered a good artist," said Al Faisal. Al Faisal, a photographer, has another reason for being wary of people's expectations: She is a princess, a granddaughter of the first king of Saudi Arabia.  Five people allegedly involved in the plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States were designated Tuesday for sanctions by the U.S. Treasury Department. The five charged include Manssor Arbabsiar and Ali Gholam Shakuri, the two men charged with planning a bombing to kill the Saudi ambassador. The other three are high-ranking officers in Iran's Quds Force, a branch of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which allegedly coordinated the attack. The three were identified as Qasem Soleimani, Hamed Abdollahi and Abdul Reza Shahlai.
