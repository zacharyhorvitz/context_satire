 With her stunning assault on FIFA last week, Loretta Lynch became a global rock star, a rare accomplishment for a U.S. attorney general. The indictment and arrest of so many of soccer's governing cardinals gathered in Switzerland, and the sweeping charges of corruption against the sport's ruling regime, seemed a quintessentially American -- Wilsonian, even -- move to make the world safe for clean sportsmanship. As often happens when the word goes out that the Yanks are coming, people around the world greeted the news with a combination of grudging admiration and shame. The Feds' energetic move, after all, stood in vivid contrast to the usual fatalism with which people in many other countries accept rampant corruption in the management of sports and in a global governing body in which more than 200 nations have equal say.  Even "Mad Men's" Don Draper might have balked at the prospect of trying to promote a feature film about FIFA at the very moment the organization was engulfed by serious allegations of widespread corruption. A full year after it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival,  FIFA's multi-million dollar biopic, "United Passions," went on limited release at cinemas across the U.S. this weekend. And it's fair to say the reviews for the film, which stars Tim Roth, Sam Neill and Gerard Depardieu haven't been kind. "Pure cinematic excrement" and "preposterous hagiography," says the Guardian. The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country comprising 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe. Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million, the U.S. is the third most populous country.
