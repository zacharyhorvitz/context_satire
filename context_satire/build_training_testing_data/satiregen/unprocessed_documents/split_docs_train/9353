Belmont Park is a major thoroughbred horse racing facility in the northeastern United States, located in Elmont, New York, just east of the New York City limits. It was opened on May 4, 1905. It is operated by the non-profit New York Racing Association, as are Aqueduct and Saratoga Race Course. The group was formed in 1955 as the Greater New York Association to assume the assets of the individual associations that ran Belmont, Aqueduct, Saratoga, and the now-defunct Jamaica Race Course. Pasquale was born in Hershey, Pennsylvania. He attended the Meadows School of the Arts at Southern Methodist University as a theatre major for one semester, before moving to New York. He has starred in numerous theatre productions. He created the role of Fabrizio in the original Seattle cast of The Light in the Piazza, but his work on Rescue Me prevented him from reprising the role on Broadway. Pasquale worked for the Civil Service's Department of Transport before joining the Smithfield meat market. The hours at the meat market became too much for a young Pasquale, so he left to work at a building site and as a spot welder at the Ford factory in Dagenham.
