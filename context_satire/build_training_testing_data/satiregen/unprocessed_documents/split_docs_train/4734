Donald Gennaro is the attorney sent on behalf of Jurassic Park's investors to investigate the safety of the park after several reports of missing or dead workers. In the novel he is described as a short muscular man and represents an "every-man" personality among the characters. Although he is initially worried only about disappointing his supervisors, he soon drops this concern when his life is threatened, focusing on survival instead. When problems begin to occur, he consistently handles them appropriately, accompanying Robert Muldoon on a mission to subdue the Tyrannosaurus and successfully restoring power, despite being ambushed by a Velociraptor. R. B. "Arby" Benton is an 11-year-old African-American boy who is friends with Kelly. He tends to be quiet and shy, but is very intelligent and good with computers. He skipped two school grades and is in seventh grade with Kelly. In the film's introduction, when a worker is attacked by a Velociraptor that the park staff are transporting, Muldoon gives the order to kill it. He notes that the raptors have tested the perimeter fence in different places, probing for an opening, and comments that the animals "show extreme intelligence. Even problem-solving intelligence." He remains in the control room with Hammond and Arnold, commenting on the many safety and security failures of the park.
