Kirkland is a surname. It originated from a habitational name with variant spellings Kirtland and Kirtlan, from the English word Kirk meaning church, plus land, and was originally given either as a topographical name to someone resident on land belonging to the church, or as a locational name from any of the several places named Kirkland. Kirkland is a civil parish, located on the banks of the River Wyre, midway between Preston and Lancaster, in the English county of Lancashire. It is also the historic name of what is now the village of Churchtown, within the parish. It is part of the Wyre district. Kirkland has a long history centred on its Grade I listed building, St Helen's, the parish church of Garstang St Helen (or Churchtown) and once known as the Cathedral of the Fylde. Methil is an eastern coastal town in Scotland. It was first recorded as "Methkil" in 1207, and belonged to the Bishop of St Andrews.
