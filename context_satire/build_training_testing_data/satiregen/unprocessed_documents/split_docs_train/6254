 President Donald Trump will make his final pitch on tax reform to the American people Wednesday in a speech that will not "lean in on as many of the specifics as his prior tax reform speeches," according to two senior administration officials who briefed reporters Tuesday. The administration sees this as a higher-altitude speech, saying the President has already addressed specific rate brackets in previous speeches. Joined by about 120 people -- families and military personnel who have been invited -- the President will speak Wednesday afternoon from the Grand Foyer of the White House. Some young people will be among those invited, and the President will dedicate a "very significant portion" of his speech to the next generation that will be affected by tax reform.  President Trump thinks more poor people should work. Congressional Republicans do, too. So expect to hear the phrase "work requirements" a lot next year. It will likely be a central feature of the GOP's planned overhaul of the nation's safety net. Hoover Dam is a concrete arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, on the border between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933, it was officially renamed Hoover Dam, for President Herbert Hoover, by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947.
