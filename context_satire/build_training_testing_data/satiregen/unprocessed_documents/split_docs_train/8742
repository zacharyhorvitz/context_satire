The first issue featured only works that had been rejected by other publications, but the journal has since begun publishing pieces written with McSweeney's in mind. The journal is based in San Francisco. McSweeney's was founded in 1998 after Dave Eggers left an editing position at Esquire, during the same time he was working on A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. McSweeney's is a sort of successor to Eggers' earlier magazine project Might, although Might was focused on editorial content and news, and not literature. Eggers also refers to McSweeney's as having "less edge" than Might. In Issue 10, it was claimed that exactly 56 issues of the journal would be published. In Issue 20, this claim was repeated in an advertisement that stated: "There will be roughly thirty-six  to come; then, a five-year retrenchment." With the publication of Issue 56 it was revealed that this had always been a joke and that they will continue to publish until at least issue 156 but would prefer if you just didn't mention it at all.
