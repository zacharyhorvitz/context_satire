The decision to include crimson red is also thought to be a tribute to the state of Georgia and a reminder of the University's flagship status. Kaolinite, commonly referred to as "Georgia red clay" is commonly found throughout the state, especially in the Red Hills Region. The red color that is so evident in Georgia soils is due primarily to iron oxides. In 1989, 17-year-old Veronica Sawyer despairs at Westerburg High School's hellish social hierarchy, where students like Martha Dunnstock are tormented by jocks Ram Sweeney and Kurt Kelly, and the school is ruled by the Heathers: weak-willed Heather McNamara, bulimic Heather Duke, and "mythic bitch" queen Heather Chandler. When Veronica's talent for forgery gets the Heathers out of detention, they give her a makeover and elevate her to their inner circle ("Beautiful"). Meanwhile, Heather begins to develop a dangerous attraction to Alex, with ultimately lethal repercussions. Shane becomes aware of Heather's attraction for Alex and forces Alex to pretend that he likes Heather in order to lure her to a remote location. Shane arrives after Heather and Alex do, with a gun in her hands. She kicks Heather.
