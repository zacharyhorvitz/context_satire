The origin and identity of the Sisters, as well as the true nature of their relationship with Count Dracula, is never revealed. One of the three may have been identified in the short story "Dracula's Guest", as the vampire named Countess Dolengen of Gratz. Jonathan Harker, the protagonist of the story, encounters her at her tomb in Munich. Just as she is about to bite him, Dracula intervenes and destroys her. The group descends into a cavern beneath the sewers, Mike providing a rock from the Losers' fight with the Bowers Gang as they perform the ritual in the remains of the meteor that brought It to Earth ages ago. The ritual appears to work in trapping the Deadlights in the sealing jar, but they escape after Pennywise emerges from the jar in a giant spider-like form. Pennywise pressures Mike into revealing that It killed those who previously performed the ritual and that Mike scratched that truth off the sealing jar. Mike assures the others they have a better chance of facing their fears, but they accuse Mike of lying to them. In 1994 Polanski directed a film of the acclaimed play Death and the Maiden. From his debut feature “Knife in the Water,” Polanski has shown an affinity for creating tension and drama in contained environments. Perhaps that's why he does so well when adapting stage plays to the screen, which was certainly the case with “Death and the Maiden.” It all takes place in one house with a storm raging outside. Sigourney Weaver stars as a housewife living with her husband (Stuart Wilson) in South Africa.
