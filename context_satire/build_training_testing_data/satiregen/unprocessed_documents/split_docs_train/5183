 There was nearly ubiquitous (77% in CNN's May poll) American support for President Donald Trump's decision to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. That's a solid turnaround for him since a CNN poll last November showed 35% approval of Trump's handling of North Korea. The summit between the two leaders occurred on Monday evening US time and Tuesday in Singapore, ending with Trump and Kim vowing to "denuke" North Korea. According to current reports, it ended amicably with the two shaking hands and smiling, though details of their plan still need to be hashed out.  Could totalitarian North Korea one day become an opportunity for American businesses? President Donald Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on Tuesday at a historic summit that the United States hopes will lead to North Korean nuclear disarmament. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised the possibility last month that US companies could invest in the isolated country if it gets rid of its nuclear weapons. It's still very unclear whether it will.  Top Senate Democrats cautioned President Donald Trump on Monday that they would not support lifting sanctions against North Korea unless a nuclear agreement with that country met five standards they laid out in a letter to the President. The warning came days before Trump is set to meet with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at a summit in Singapore. The principles would require North Korea to denuclearize and get rid of all biological and chemical weapons, end production and enrichment of nuclear materials, scrap its ballistic missile program and allow robust inspections. The agreement also would have to be permanent.
