 President Donald Trump's golf scores have been hacked by someone apparently hoping to raise his handicap, the United States Golf Association confirmed to CNN Sports. Four less-than-flattering scores of 101, 100, 108, 102 were uploaded to the Golf Handicap and Information Network (GHIN) Friday and have since been removed, as has Trump's lifetime best round of 68 reported last month. Donald Trump had the best golf round of his life last month "We have become aware of reports in the media questioning recent scores posted on President Trump's GHIN account," USGA spokeswoman Janeen Driscoll said in a statement. "As we dug into the data it appears someone has erroneously posted a number of scores on behalf of the GHIN user.  President Donald Trump keeps taking Nancy Pelosi's bait. The House speaker spent the last week provoking Trump, questioning his self-confidence, condescendingly confiding that she prays for him and suggesting a "family intervention." The President's wild, improvised response Thursday suggests that so far, the speaker is winning the hugely consequential clash between Washington's top two political forces. It's not often that Trump, the man who dismembered the most talented Republican primary field in years in 2016, seems to be struggling for traction in a face-to-face political fight. While criticizing the special counsel investigation in July 2019, Trump falsely claimed that Article Two of the United States Constitution ensures that: "I have to the right to do whatever I want as president". Also in July 2019, Trump said that "free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposefully write badÂ ... To me that's very dangerous speech and you become angry at it." Trump's definition contradicts the First Amendment to the United States Constitution on free speech.
