It is impossible for someone to die by simply holding their breath, as the level of oxygen in the blood becomes too low, the brain sends an involuntary reflex, and the person breathes in as the respiratory muscles contract. Even if one is able to overcome this response to the point of becoming unconscious, in this condition, it is no longer possible to control breathing, and a normal rhythm is reestablished. The following year, the team won their second straight provincial junior title. At the 1994 Canadian Juniors, the team once again found themselves in a three-way tie for third, this time with Ontario and Northern Ontario, and with a 7–4 record. In their first tie-breaker, they defeated Northern Ontario's Rhonda Halvorsen 10–4. They then defeated Ontario's Dominique Lascelles 10–8 in the second tie-breaker. Jones participated in the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials in mid December, there the team played a 2–5 record and ended up tied for sixth place and off of the playoffs. She later revealed that she was sick all week unable to play well. "We worked really, really hard and wanted to excel at this event, but it just didn't work out," Jones told reporters.
