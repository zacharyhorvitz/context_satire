In Copenhagen, he starts modeling for "some weird flower water" under the name Silas Guinard. He returns to the United States with Andy, Doug, and Shane to find Nancy. When they go to the halfway house where she was staying, he and Nancy make eye contact for the first time in 3 years, and Nancy flees. He gets angry at her again and decides to leave the halfway house and go try to start his modeling career in New York City. Conrad Shepard (Romany Malco, leading character in seasons 1â€“3, guest season 8) is Nancy's initial supplier, under supervision of his aunt. Nancy met him years earlier through Andy. Although Conrad is very knowledgeable about the intricacies of marijuana cultivation, his aunt never allowed him to grow plants, insisting that they keep their business small. Despite this, he had worked on developing his own signature genetic blend. During season 8, Doug lives with Jill, Andy, and the rest of Nancy's family. He has a one-night stand with Jill during her breakup with Andy. During this time, his previous funding business scam is discovered, leading to decline all of his monetary accounts. He then decides to open a makeshift homeless shelter, which will later go onto as a sham religious cult, making him Guru Doug.
