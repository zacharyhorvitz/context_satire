 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg did not give a direct answer when asked Wednesday if the social media site had an impact on the results of the 2016 election. "It's really hard for me to have a full assessment of that," Zuckerberg said in an exclusive interview with Laurie Segall that aired on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360." "The reality is, well, there were so many different forces at play." Zuckerberg said he was "sure" Facebook activity had "some impact" on the outcome, citing organic Facebook posts from users, the organization's "get out the vote" effort, candidate pages and online advertising.  Facebook's first black eye was from "fake news." The social network's secretive algorithm enabled hoaxes and lies to reach millions of people during the US presidential campaign in 2016. Analysts were taken aback by the scope of the problem. Facebook vowed to make changes.  Until Wednesday night, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had been conspicuously absent from the conversation around the siphoning of data by researchers working with the research firm Cambridge Analytica -- and, more broadly, the company's alleged role in Russia's manipulation of the 2016 US presidential election. An awkward interview subject, Zuckerberg had preferred to let others at Facebook present its perspective on these hot-button issues -- and to face the increasingly angry grievances of a public whose distrust of the platform is at an all-time high. But on Wednesday, with numerous pundits saying the situation had devolved into an existential crisis for the company, Zuckerberg embarked on a whirlwind talking tour with journalists, most prominently in an exclusive TV interview with CNN's Laurie Segall, who appeared on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360." The beginning of the two-part interview was uncomfortable.
