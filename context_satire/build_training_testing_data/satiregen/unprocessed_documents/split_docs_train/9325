 Even without sound, the video is disturbing. In a series of black and white images, it shows a man appearing to drag a woman down the street and force her into a car. Philadelphia police released the footage Monday in the hopes of catching the suspect, whom they describe as an unknown black male of medium-heavy build, 25-30 years old. He's seen in the video wearing a dark jacket with a hood, a dark hat and dark pants.  Two days after a Philadelphia woman's abduction was captured on video, police say they have a lead across the state line: Someone used her bank card Tuesday morning in Maryland. A male used Carlesha Freeland-Gaither's ATM card at 6:01 a.m. a bank in Aberdeen, Maryland, about a 75-mile drive southwest from the Philadelphia street where she was forced into a car on Sunday night, Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson told reporters. Wilson didn't say how the card was used or whether cash was withdrawn. But he said surveillance video showed a male "similar" to the man who police say dragged and abducted the 22-year-old woman Sunday night. With a lack of consumer confidence in the economic direction given by the federal government panic started to spread across the country shortly after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. President Hoover retained the Gold Standard as the country's currency gauge throughout the following years. As a result, the American shareholders with the majority of the gold reserves began to grow wary of the value of gold in the near future. Europe's decision to move away from the Gold Standard caused individuals to start to withdraw gold shares and move the investments out of the country or began to hoard gold for future investment.
