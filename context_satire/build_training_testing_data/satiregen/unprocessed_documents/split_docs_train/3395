The following year saw such rapid growth that the board moved to the high school site on Princess Anne Road. This site was officially occupied and its name was immediately changed to Booker T. Washington High School. In 1917, Booker T. Washington High School became Virginia’s first accredited public high school for African Americans. In 1924, keeping pace with its own rapid growth, a new and then modern Booker T. Washington High School opened on Virginia Beach Boulevard with a student body of 1750 in grades 7–12 and a faculty of 63 teachers. Booker T. Washington High School was named in honor of Booker T. Washington who was an African-American educator, author, orator, and adviser to presidents of the United States. The school dates to April 1911, when the Norfolk School Board agreed to endorse one year of high school learning in connection with elementary school at John T. West School. In 1912, a second year was added and, in 1913, a third year was included. In May 1914, the State Board of Education endorsed the high school and the local board passed an act which gave Virginia its first accredited public high school for African-Americans. On 28 August 2009, McIntyre re-debuted on the SmackDown brand, disregarding his previous time on WWE television, and established himself as a villain by attacking R-Truth as he entered the ring, using his new double underhook DDT finishing move, the Scot Drop (soon renamed the Future Shock). McIntyre continued to attack Truth over the following weeks, claiming to be on the show to wrestle not to party like R-Truth. On 18 September, while Charlie Haas was waiting to face R-Truth, McIntyre came to the ring to explain that R-Truth had been injured backstage, and then attacked Haas. On 25 September, WWE Chairman Mr. McMahon introduced McIntyre as a "future world champion" that he had personally signed, after which Truth made a return attack against McIntyre.
