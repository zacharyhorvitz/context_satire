 Uber's new carpooling service may rival the city bus. The company announced on Wednesday a shared ride service called Express Pool. Fares will cost as much as half the price of Uber Pool. Starting this week, Uber customers in select cities will be able to request a shared ride with up to four passengers.  An Uber Eats driver wanted in connection with the fatal shooting of a customer over the weekend shot the victim in self-defense, the suspect's attorney said Monday. Robert Bivines, 36, turned himself in to authorities around 3 p.m. on Monday after police secured a warrant for his arrest on a felony murder charge, Atlanta Police said. Bivines was taken to the Fulton County Jail and booked on the felony murder charge related to the killing of Ryan Thornton, 30, of Atlanta, police said. Police said the shooting happened about 11:30 p.m. Saturday in the city's Buckhead neighborhood after the victim, identified by the Fulton County medical examiner's office as Thornton, placed a food order via his smartphone app. On New Year's Eve, after Camp and his friends spent $800 hiring a private driver, Camp wanted to find a way to reduce the cost of direct transportation. He realized that sharing the cost with people could make it affordable, and his idea morphed into Uber. Kalanick joined Camp and gives him "full credit for the idea" of Uber. The first prototype was built by Camp and his friends, Oscar Salazar and Conrad Whelan, with Kalanick being brought on as a "mega advisor" to the company.
