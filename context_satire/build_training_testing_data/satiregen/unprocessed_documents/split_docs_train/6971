The son of a legendary con artist, Bobby Caldwell, Linus is one of two newcomers to Danny's crew, recruited by Danny in person. Having witnessed Linus' pickpocket skills grifting in Chicago, he offers him a key slot on his crew for one of the essential parts of the elaborate heist. Throughout the trilogy, Linus repeatedly makes attempts to live up to the reputation of his family and gain respect within the crew. At various times, he seems to succeed: he backs up Danny in Eleven by bringing extra batteries for the explosives, which turn out to be crucial, and in Twelve gets a chance to run the con when half the crew end up in prison. The Caldwell First Nation is a First Nations band government whose land base is located in Leamington, Ontario, Canada. They are an Anishinaabe group, part of the Three Fires Confederacy, comprising the bands Potawatomi, Odawa, and Ojibwa, whose members are originally of the Mikinaak (Turtle) and the Makwa (Bear) dodems. The Caldwell First Nation are a distinct and federally recognized Indian band and used to be referred to by such names as: the "Chippewas of Pelee", "Point Pelee Indians" and "Caldwell's band of Indians." The Chippewa (also called Ojibwa in Canada) are an Anishinaabe-speaking indigenous nation with people within the borders of present-day Canada and the United States. Caldwell and fellow climbers Beth Rodden, John Dickey and Jason Smith were held hostage for six days by rebels in Kyrgyzstan in August 2000. Caldwell pushed a lone captor, Ravshan Sharipov, off a cliff, and subsequently escaped to government soldiers. They later learned that Sharipov survived the fall. A book about their ordeal, Over the Edge: The True Story of Four American Climbers' Kidnap and Escape in the Mountains of Central Asia was written by Greg Child.
