Surrounding the first floor lobby staircase in Parks Library are eight mural panelsdesigned by Iowa artist Grant Wood. As with Breaking the Prairie Sod, Wood's otherIowa State University mural painted two years later, Wood borrowed his theme for When Tillage Begins Other Arts Follow from a speech on agriculture delivered by DanielWebster in 1840 at the State House in Boston. Webster said, “When tillage begins, otherarts follow. The farmers therefore are the founders of human civilization.” Wood hadplanned to create seventeen mural panels for the library, but only the eleven devoted toagriculture and the practical arts were completed. The Iowa State Daily is the university's student newspaper. The Daily has its roots from a news sheet titled the Clipper, which was started in the spring of 1890 by a group of students at Iowa Agricultural College led by F.E. Davidson. The Clipper soon led to the creation of the Iowa Agricultural College Student, and the beginnings of what would one day become the Iowa State Daily.
