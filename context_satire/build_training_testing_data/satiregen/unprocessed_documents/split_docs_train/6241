Christopher Noxon appeared on The Colbert Report on June 29, 2006. On the show, Noxon told the story of how he met his wife. Apparently they met while playing kickball (Colbert: You were both in eighth grade? Noxon: No, mid-twenties). After three years with the Shockers, a time in which he also served as the school's athletic director, Trimble accepted an assistant coaching position with the Eagles in 1951. Bo McMillin, the man who had hired him, was diagnosed with cancer early in that first season and resigned in favor of Wayne Millner. When Millner himself resigned on September 8, 1952, Trimble was promoted to head coach. He was at that time the youngest head coach in the NFL & was for decades still one of the youngest ever. Out of football during 1966, Trimble remained in Hudson, Quebec, a suburb of Montreal. Here, he and a Montreal friend began to market a new type of goal post that was supported by only one post, instead of the two aka the "H" that had been the standard since the game began. The so-called "slingshot" goalposts, named because of their "Y" shape, were adopted by CFL in 1966 and by the NFL in 1967, just after Trimble returned to coaching as an offensive line assistant with the New York Giants. Trimble had been offered the job by head coach Allie Sherman while attempting to sell the team his innovative goal posts.
