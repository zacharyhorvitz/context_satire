Ricola Ltd./Ricola AG is a Swiss manufacturer of cough drops and breath mints. All their products include natural herbal ingredients exclusively cultivated on Swiss soil without any use of pesticides, insecticides or herbicides. The head office of Ricola is located in Laufen, Basel-Country. In February 1938, Seyss-Inquart was appointed Austrian Minister of the Interior by Schuschnigg, after Adolf Hitler had threatened Schuschnigg with military actions against Austria in the event of non-compliance. On 11 March 1938, faced with a German invasion aimed at preventing a plebiscite of independence, Schuschnigg resigned as Austrian Chancellor. Under growing pressure from Berlin, President Wilhelm Miklas reluctantly appointed Seyss-Inquart his successor. On the next day German troops crossed the border of Austria at the telegraphed invitation of Seyss-Inquart. The company is now managed by Thomas P. Meier as CEO and Felix Richterich as President of the Board. Today, Ricola exports to over 50 countries in Asia, North America and Europe.
