Under Falwell Jr., Liberty University has come under scrutiny for its authoritarian control over employees and students, for its nepotism toward Falwell family-owned businesses in the school's investments, and for the increasing influence of Falwell's wife Becki in school affairs. A 2019 Politico article described the University as a "dictatorship" in which Falwell ruled through fear; it also reported that the University sold merchandise promoting Donald Trump's presidential campaign; that Falwell Jr. had crude discussions about his sex life at work; and that Falwell Jr. showed other Liberty employees provocative photos of his wife. In 2019, Falwell Jr. was accused of using the university for his family's financial benefit. Falwell responded to the accusations by asserting that the FBI would investigate a "criminal conspiracy" in which individuals stole university property and shared it with reporters in an effort to damage his reputation. Later, as the organization gained more influence in the 1980s, their rhetoric became more explicit in their stance on gay rights as they characterized the movement as an attack on the American family. Jerry Falwell Sr. expressed that because gay people were rejected by most of society, they had no choice but to prey on the young and were therefore a threat to children and families. Various Moral Majority members also expressed more extreme opinions, such as Moral Majority commentator Charlie Judd, who argued that â€œThere are absolutes in this world. Just as jumping off a building will kill a person, so will the spread of homosexuality bring about the demise of American culture as we know it".
