Lungren ran for Congress again in the 3rd Congressional District after six-year incumbent Congressman Doug Ose announced his retirement. Lungren has stated that his desire to serve in Congress again was rekindled by the September 11, 2001 attacks. He won a come from behind victory in a three-way primary against Mary Ose and State Senator Rico Oller in 2004. Bera ran for re-election in 2014, facing former Republican congressman Doug Ose, who had represented what was then the 3rd from 1999 to 2005, in the general election. The Rothenberg Political Report rated the 7th district "Lean Democratic," but The Sacramento Bee reported that Bera was "viewed by both parties as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the country." Bera was a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's Frontline program, designed to support vulnerable candidates. In June 2014, Politico reported that the DCCC planned to support Bera with $1.7 million in ads throughout fall 2014, and the House Majority PAC, a political action committee designed to support Democratic candidates, reserved $200,000 for late-election television ads. On September 3, 2013, Ose formally announced his candidacy for his old district, which had been renumbered as the 7th district, in hopes of facing freshman Democrat Ami Bera, who unseated Dan Lungren in 2012. On June 3, Ose qualified for the November general election by ranking second in the open primary with 26% of the vote. He defeated Republicans Igor Birman and Elizabeth Emken. Bera ranked first with 48% of the vote and faced Ose in the general election.
