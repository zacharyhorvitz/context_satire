In season 11, Derek is involved in a fatal car accident while driving to the airport for his final trip to Washington. He can hear and process auditory input but is unable to speak. He is recognized by Winnie, one of the victims of a crash he assisted in earlier, who tells the surgeons that their patient's name is Derek and that he is a surgeon as well. The hospital he was taken to was understaffed, and his head injury was not detected quickly enough by the interns on duty that night. On the day of the wedding, Katie overheard Donna confiding to her friend Jackie (Lesley-Anne Down) that she was not really in love with Thorne. Katie informed Thorne of this and he called off the wedding. Donna disowned Katie for her betrayal, while Katie appears to have struck up a friendship with a grateful Stephanie. According to Stephanie, she is "The only decent Logan on the family tree." Throughout her marriage to Bill Spencer, Jr. (Don Diamont), the couple have endured multiple challenges, including all of Bill's plotting to kill someone. Tom said "even though Katie 'left him' at one point, she never walked out on him in the regard where she's not trying to come back; trying to find her way back." Describing her as the girl who doesn't cut and run, additionally stating "It would take a lot for her to walk away from this relationship - she feels like this is the man she loves, she understands who she's married to - she knows she didn't marry a boy scout." Katie is someone to "correct" Bill and "love" him through his wrongdoing, according to the actress.
