In the US, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 was passed to protect US species deemed in danger of extinction. The concern at the time was that the country was losing species that were scientifically, culturally, and educationally important. In the same year, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES) was passed as part of an international agreement to prevent the global trade of endangered wildlife. In 1980, the World Conservation Strategy was developed by the IUCN with help from the UN Environmental Programme, World Wildlife Fund, UN Food and Agricultural Organization, and UNESCO.  Here's a little bit of happy news for the environment. After a period of decline, the monarch butterfly population has made a big comeback in Mexico, where they migrate during North America's winter season, according to a new report. Researchers at the Mexican National Commission of Protected Natural Areas and the World Wildlife Fund said they observed a 225% increase from 2015 to 2016 in common habitat areas. The butterflies are typically found in pine and fir forests in several Mexican states. Habitat conservation is the practice of protecting a habitat in order to protect the species within it. This is sometimes preferable to focusing on a single species especially if the species in question has very specific habitat requirements or lives in a habitat with many other endangered species. The latter is often true of species living in biodiversity hotspots, which are areas of the world with an exceptionally high concentration of endemic species (species found nowhere else in the world). Many of these hotspots are in the tropics, mainly tropical forests like the Amazon.
