Hunters is an American television drama series that aired on Syfy, created by Natalie Chaidez and executive produced by Chaidez, Emile Levisetti and Gale Anne Hurd.

Only Addison remains uncharmed by Wilson, and when Wilson finally comes back, his resources exhausted, he finds that Mama has died in his absence. Addison angrily throws Wilson out of the house.
