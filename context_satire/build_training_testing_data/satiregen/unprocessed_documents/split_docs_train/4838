A disaster occurred near Forthassa in January 1908. A company of legionnaires was marching from the fort at Berguent (Ras-el-Ain) to Forthassa. After several stages, they were caught in a storm with high winds and snow. Unable to erect their tents, they continued through the night. For some time after establishing their protectorate over Morocco the French considered Forthassa Gharbia to be in Morocco, although the post was manned by Algerian troops. The troops collected the zekat tax on animals from the Beni Guil, a Moroccan tribe, in the name of the Moroccan government, and this money was used to maintain the post. However, eventually the French decided the post was in Algeria, drawing the boundary to the west of it. North Africa is a region encompassing the northern portion of the African continent. There is no singularly accepted scope for the region, and it is sometimes defined as stretching from the Atlantic shores of Mauritania in the west, to Egypt's Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the east. Others have limited it to the countries of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, a region that was known by the French during colonial times as "Afrique du Nord" and is known by Arabs as the Maghreb ("West", The western part of Arab World). The most commonly accepted definition includes Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and Sudan, the 6 countries that shape the top North of the African continent.
