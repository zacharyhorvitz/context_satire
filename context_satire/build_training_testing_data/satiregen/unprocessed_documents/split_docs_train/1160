After being on the show for two years, Kinney received a promotion to series regular for season 4, along with Chad Coleman and Sonequa Martin-Green. The fourth-season episode "Still," which focuses only on Beth and Daryl, garnered praise in particular from television commentators, with viewers of the series having shipped Beth and Daryl as a couple. Writing for IGN, Roth Cornet commended the "Still" episode, stating that "Daryl and Beth revealed themselves to be more perfect a fit than any of the other combinations" and that "hey brought out a raw honesty in one another that yielded what were some of the most grounded and engaging character moments of the season. They are two sides of a coin, and that's not something that had been entirely clear prior to this entry." The children have tickets to the premiere of Weirder Things, a reference to Netflix's Stranger Things, but when Tess's mom can no longer take them, they look to Raven and Chelsea for help. However, Chelsea is suffering from a terrible cold, making her delirious, and Raven is having her weave redone. Meanwhile, Mitch attempts to be nice after discovering the children also love Weirder Things. Raven and Chelsea decide to go out to a club called The Vault. However, when they are unable to find a babysitter for the night, they decide to trust their children and Tess to stay home alone. While they are out, the children spill drinks on a chair and attempt to fix it. Meanwhile, Raven and Chelsea run into problems with a partygoer.
