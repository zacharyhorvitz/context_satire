On September 16, the commission announced the official invitation of both Clinton and Trump to participate in the first debate to be held on September 26 at Hofstra University, but Johnson did not meet the established criteria, and would not be a participant in the debate. It was also announced that Mike Pence and Tim Kaine would be participating in the only scheduled vice presidential debate, to take place at Longwood University on October 4, and Weld did not reach the cutoff.  Presidential debates are unpredictable enough with just two candidates and a moderator. And this Sunday's will add questions from a live audience of undecided voters on top of that. The upcoming presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be a town-hall format, which means half the questions will come from uncommitted voters in the debate hall, while the other half will be influenced by voters' concerns on social media.

Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence are scheduled to face each other on stage for their first and only official debate Tuesday night. The Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan organization that manages the official presidential contests, will host the event at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, on Tuesday from 9:00-10:30 p.m. ET.
