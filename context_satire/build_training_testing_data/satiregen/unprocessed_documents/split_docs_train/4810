Whereas business managers have been making capital investment decisions for centuries, the term "real option" is relatively new, and was coined by Professor Stewart Myers of the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1977. In 1930, Irving Fisher wrote explicitly of the "options" available to a business owner (The Theory of Interest, II.VIII). The description of such opportunities as "real options", however, followed on the development of analytical techniques for financial options, such as Blackâ€“Scholes in 1973. As such, the term "real option" is closely tied to these option methods. In 1900, Foreman Sloan left the business, but Earl continued, adopting his father's title "Doctor" and organizing a company to manufacture the liniment. The company offices were moved to Boston in 1904 when Dr. Sloan purchased a large factory building, formerly owned by Green's Nervura Medicine Company. On October 26 of that same year, the business was incorporated as "Dr. Earl S. Sloan, Incorporated." Records in the office of the Secretary of State for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts disclose that the authorized capital for the new corporation consists of $50,000, $10 per parcel.
