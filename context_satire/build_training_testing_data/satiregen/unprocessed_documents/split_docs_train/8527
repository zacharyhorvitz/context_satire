On July 11, 2018, it was reported that Schnatter had used the word "nigger" during a conference call with marketing agency Laundry Service in May of that year, saying "Colonel Sanders called blacks niggers and Sanders never faced public outcry". In the call, he also said that people in Indiana where he was from used to drag African Americans from trucks until they died, which may have been intended as a way of expressing distaste for historical racism, but was considered offensive by some of the people on the call. The conference call had been a role-playing exercise to help train Schnatter to avoid making remarks that could cause public controversy and damage the company reputation. After the call, the owner of the marketing agency moved to end their contract with Papa John's. The finished novel describes the wartime experiences of Army Air Corps Captain John Yossarian. Yossarian devises multiple strategies to avoid combat missions, but the military bureaucracy is always able to find a way to make him stay. As Heller observed, "Everyone in my book accuses everyone else of being crazy. Frankly, I think the whole society is nuts â€“ and the question is: What does a sane man do in an insane society?" Papa John's also received media attention on January 6, 2012, when an employee typed the phrase "lady chinky eyes" on a receipt issued to an Asian American customer at a restaurant in New York City. The employee was fired and the company issued a formal apology. A manager at the restaurant where the incident occurred told the New York Post that the cashier, a teenager, did not intend to offend saying, "It's a busy place, and it was a way to identify her and her order. You know, we do stuff like that sometimes.
