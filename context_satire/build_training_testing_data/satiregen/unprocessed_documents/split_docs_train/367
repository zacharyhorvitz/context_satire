 President Donald Trump used a solemn address from the White House on Monday to call for unity in the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, calling the massacre an "act of pure evil." The gun attack on a country music festival Sunday in Las Vegas killed at least 50 people and injured more than 400 others. In a subdued statement, Trump said the nation was united "in sadness, shock and grief." Reading from a teleprompter in the Diplomatic Reception Room, Trump mourned the victims and announced he would visit the stricken Nevada city on Wednesday.  Vigils are being held across the US for victims of Sunday's shooting in Las Vegas, which left dozens dead and hundreds injured. National and international landmarks went dark as a show of respect to the victims of the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Much of the Las Vegas Strip, where the shooting occurred, went dark Monday night, as did New York's Empire State Building. "Tonight our lights darken for the victims and those affected by the Las Vegas attack," the New York landmark said on Twitter, adding that an orange halo would be displayed to "(shine) a light on gun violence."  President Donald Trump avoided the topic of gun control while visiting Las Vegas Wednesday, just days after the deadliest shooting in modern American history. The visit, which comes hours after Trump visited Puerto Rico to survey the damage wrought by Hurricane Maria, marks the President's second trip to soothe national concerns in as many days. In Las Vegas, Trump met with local politicians, first responders and survivors of the shooting that killed 58 people and injured more than 500 others. Though Washington lawmakers have been facing questions about possible gun control measures in the wake of the massacre, Trump told reporters that he would not address the issue while traveling in Las Vegas.
