G. W. Carver High School is a high school in the Desire Area, in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans. It is a public charter high school. In April 2011, Larry Harvey announced that the LLC was beginning a three-year process to transfer ownership and control of the event over to a new non-profit organization called the "Burning Man Project." The move towards becoming a non-profit organization was the result of "bitter infighting" between members of the board. At one point it looked like all of the board members were going to hire lawyers. Corporate appraisers were brought in to determine how much the company was worth, which Larry Harvey found "abhorrent" and against all of the values that Burning Man stood for. Co-writer Luke Dick said of the song, "The chorus is the idea of being a walking contradiction in some regards. There is — especially for artistic types‚ the feeling of wanting to wander or be out in the world, but also the desire to be grounded in some way too". This "contradiction" is expressed in the lyric "I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man." He said that he did not have the idea until he began to write songs with Bobby Pinson, and after completing the song, the two chose to offer it to Bentley.
