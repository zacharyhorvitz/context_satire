 It's a spring break with a purpose: Ten days in Texas when the entertainment and tech worlds collide on the neo-bohemian streets of this Texas party town. The annual South by Southwest festival will have its share of parties for the tens of thousands who will attend. But it will also be showcasing the best and brightest in its three main subject areas: Music, film and interactive (read startups, technology and the Web). It's a lot to try to keep up with.  If you fast-forward a decade, classrooms and lessons might look a little different, according to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates. Today, classes are too big. Lessons are taught the same way to dozens or hundreds of students -- each of whom has different learning style. Technology can, and should, change that, Gates argues.  Talk about being a victim of your own success. Among several new initiatives announced by Marvel Entertainment at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival was a two-day giveaway of 700 issues of classic Marvel No. 1 issues via their app. The adventures, new and old, of the X-Men, Spider-Man and the Avengers would be available free, and the first issues would make it easier for new readers to follow.
