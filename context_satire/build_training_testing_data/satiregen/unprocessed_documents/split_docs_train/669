In Greenville, Mississippi, Terrie Robinson is having difficulty coping with the stresses of being a single mother on welfare. Convinced that she is not worthy of motherhood and that she is possessed by Satan, she places her three-year-old son, Tristan, in an oven in March 2011 and cooks him alive. She is serving a life sentence. Patricia Wells is working as a nurse in a retirement home when she meets William Jennings. Although he is old enough to be her grandfather, the two are soon a couple. She convinces her new husband to transfer half of his assets into her account and eventually has control of everything he owns. She spends his money fast, drugging him, making it appear he has dementia, so he won't intervene. In 1981, she returned to the Royal Court for the London premiere of Brian Friel's Faith Healer. That same year she also won acclaim for her performance in the title role of John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi, a production of Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre which was later transferred to The Roundhouse in Chalk Farm, London. Reviewing her portrayal for The Sunday Telegraph, Francis King wrote: "Miss Mirren never leaves it in doubt that even in her absences, this ardent, beautiful woman is the most important character of the story."
