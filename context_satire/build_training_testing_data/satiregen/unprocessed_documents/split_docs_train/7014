 Rudy Giuliani said the White House has not spoken to him about his comments that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un "begged" for a summit between the US and North Korean leaders. "Not a word," Giuliani told CNN Thursday, adding that "it's a metaphor." But he acknowledged that he is "not privy to actual details," calling it a "fair interpretation of what happened." Speaking at a conference in Tel Aviv Wednesday, Giuliani said "Kim Jong Un got back on his hands and knees and begged for it, which is exactly the position you want to put him in."  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un "begged" US President Donald Trump to reschedule their summit meeting after Trump abruptly canceled it last month, Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday. Trump had canceled the now-rescheduled June 12 meeting with Kim after statements from North Korea in May that called US Vice President Mike Pence a "political dummy" and said Pyongyang was ready for a nuclear showdown with Washington if dialogue failed. "We said we're not going to have a summit under those circumstances," Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, told a business conference in Tel Aviv, Israel. "Well, Kim Jong Un got back on his hands and knees and begged for it, which is exactly the position you want to put him in," Giuliani said.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shrugged off comments made by President Donald Trump's top Russia lawyer Rudy Giuliani, saying the former mayor doesn't speak for the administration on North Korea. "I know Rudy. Rudy doesn't speak for the administration when it comes to this negotiation and this set of issues," Pompeo said Thursday when asked about Giuliani's comments by CNN's Pamela Brown. Giuliani told a conference in Israel that Kim "got back on his hands and knees and begged for" the summit.
