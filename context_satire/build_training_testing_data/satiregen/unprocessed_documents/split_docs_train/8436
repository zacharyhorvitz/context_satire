A subsequent meeting between Santana and Davis took place, during which the guitarist expressed his desire to produce more concise and radio friendly songs with strong melody lines and lyrics that a wide range of people could relate to. He convinced Davis that he "wasn't stuck in the '60s; I was adaptable to these times", and cited Miles Davis and John Coltrane as artists who went on to change musical directions towards pop in their later careers. Davis agreed to assist on the project and signed the band to a record deal in late 1997. He aimed to have the new album surpass sales figures of the band's second, Abraxas (1970), which had sold over 4 million copies in the US at the time.

Thomas received three Grammy Awards for co-writing and singing on the 1999 hit "Smooth" by Santana. Before recording their second album, Rob Thomas collaborated with Itaal Shur on a song called "Smooth" for Carlos Santana's comeback album, Supernatural. Thomas was supposed to act only as a songwriter for "Smooth", but Carlos Santana had him sing for it after hearing the song's demo. "Smooth" was the album's lead single and became a hit in 1999. Thomas won three Grammy Awards for writing and performing on "Smooth": Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Popular Music Collaboration with Vocals.
