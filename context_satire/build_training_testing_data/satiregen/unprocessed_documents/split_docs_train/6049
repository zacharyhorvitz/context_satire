The PBS NewsHour is an American daily evening television news program and the news division that is broadcast on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), airing seven nights a week on more than 350 of the public broadcaster's member stations. As the nation's first hour-long nightly news broadcast, the program is known for its in-depth coverage of issues and current events.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will face questions from two congressional panels next week about how his company handles its users' data. He's set to appear before a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees on Tuesday afternoon followed by a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing the following morning. "Our joint hearing will be a public conversation with the CEO of this powerful and influential company about his vision for addressing problems that have generated significant concern about Facebook's role in our democracy, bad actors using the platform, and user privacy," Sen. John Thune, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, said in a statement Wednesday. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee said the hearing "will explore approaches to privacy that satisfy consumer expectations while encouraging innovation." Until 2008, the journal was published by the University of Chicago Press on behalf of the AAS. The reasons for the change to the IOP were given by the society as the desire of the University of Chicago Press to revise its financial arrangement and their plans to change from the particular software that had been developed in-house. The other two publications of the society, the Astrophysical Journal and its supplement series, followed in January 2009.
