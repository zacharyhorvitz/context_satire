As the chief justice, Roberts also serves in a variety of non-judicial roles, including chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution and leading the Judicial Conference of the United States. Perhaps the best known of these is the custom of the chief justice administering the oath of office at presidential inaugurations. Roberts debuted in this capacity at the inauguration of Barack Obama on January 20, 2009. (As a senator, Obama had voted against Roberts's confirmation to the Supreme Court, making the event doubly a first: the first time a president was sworn in by someone whose confirmation he opposed.)  As Donald Trump puts his hand on the bible Friday and swears to "faithfully execute the Office of President" few people will focus on the man in the judicial robe delivering the oath. But, oh, to have a thought bubble over Chief Justice John Roberts' head. Roberts will swear in a President-elect who has called the chief justice a "nightmare for conservatives" and lambasted his voting record. At the same time, a Trump presidency guarantees something critical to Roberts' own legacy: a conservative majority.  Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States on Friday, vowing to drain power from Washington elites and always put "America first" in its dealings with the world at a moment of transformative political change. He arrived at the White House for the first time as President just before 5 p.m. ET following a day of tradition marking the power shift in the nation's capital. In a time-honored ceremony on the flag-draped West Front of the Capitol earlier in the afternoon, Trump placed his left hand on a family Bible and another that belonged to Abraham Lincoln and promised to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.
