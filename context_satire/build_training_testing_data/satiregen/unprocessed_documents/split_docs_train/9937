 This is surreal. On Thursday the President of the United States tweeted a mashup of the Speaker of the House to make it look as if she is drunk, incapacitated or slurring her words. The video was originally spread on social media before a Fox Business Network program featured it on air, prompting speculation about Pelosi's health and ostensibly inspiring the President's tweet. The is one of several doctored videos that have been circulating on social media.  A manipulated video being shared by some social media users to spread a false claim that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slurred her words after meeting with President Donald Trump on Wednesday has been removed by YouTube, the company told CNN on Thursday. The crudely edited video comes amid warnings from the US intelligence community that more sophisticated video manipulation may be part of future disinformation campaigns targeting the American electorate. The video, which shows Pelosi's onstage comments at the Center for American Progress on Wednesday, has been slowed down, which makes her words seem slurred. Pelosi's spokesman declined to comment on the video when contacted by CNN.  President Donald Trump and his allies are attempting to discredit House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- questioning her mental capabilities by sharing videos, including one that was doctored, of her appearing to slur her speech and stammer at recent public events. The videos, shared and viewed by millions, come during ongoing tensions between Democrats and the President over several House investigations probing his business, campaign and finances as well as mounting pressure on Pelosi to pursue impeachment. This week, two courts ruled against the President, who is appealing those rulings, to try to prevent his bank and accounting records from going to congressional investigators. Ahead of her meeting at the White House on Wednesday to discuss infrastructure, Pelosi accused the President of a cover-up.
