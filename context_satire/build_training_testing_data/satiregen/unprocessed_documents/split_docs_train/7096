 Buzz Aldrin, one of the first two men to walk on the moon back in 1969, has used one of mankind's oldest monuments as a backdrop for his call for a new leap in space exploration. The veteran astronaut posted a picture to his Twitter feed Monday of himself in front of England's famed Stonehenge, a prehistoric stone circle, wearing a T-shirt proclaiming "Get your ass to Mars."

Jupiter, however, put an end to those early occupiers of the inner orbits, bulldozing in and sweeping them into the sun, according to a paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
