 While Attorney General Eric Holder had made clear that he wanted to leave the post before the end of Obama's second term, the announcement of his departure just before midterm elections took many by surprise and the timing could complicate the effort to replace him. Choosing a new attorney general and getting approval in a Senate confirmation hearing will be difficult for the White House. While the list of strong candidates who could assume the role is long, congressional politics will make it difficult to get Senate approval for just about anyone. Plus, while he has endured his share of controversies, Holder is also President Barack Obama's very close friend and confidant, someone for whom the President consistently communicated his full support.  Attorney General Eric Holder announced Thursday that he will resign after six years at the helm of the Justice Department. Holder has agreed to remain in his post until the confirmation of his successor. "In the months ahead I will leave the Department of Justice," Holder said at the White House, thanking President Barack Obama for the "greatest honor of my professional life." Though he's stepping down, Holder said that "he will never leave the work."  Long overdue or not long enough? Lawmakers are beginning to weigh in on the news of Attorney General Eric Holder's resignation, which the former Justice Department prosecutor is expected to announce Thursday afternoon. Holder will resign after leading the Justice Department for over five years. He is one of only three remaining officials originally elected to President Barack Obama's cabinet in 2009.  Who might replace Eric Holder?
