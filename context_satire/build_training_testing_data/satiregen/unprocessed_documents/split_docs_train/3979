There have been only three artists who have won all four General Field awards: Best New Artist, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Album of the Year. In 1981, Christopher Cross became the first artist to win all four awards, as well as the first artist to win all four awards in a single ceremony. Adele is the second artist to win all four, and the first female to do so. In 2009, she won Best New Artist and in 2012 and 2017, she won Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and  Album of the Year. Bon Iver subsequently received four nominations in November for the 54th Grammy Awards. After winning the award, Vernon said in his acceptance, "It's really hard to accept this award. There's so much talent out here  and there's a lot of talent that's not here tonight. It's also hard to accept because you know, when I started to make songs I did it for the inherent reward of making songs, so I'm a little bit uncomfortable up here." When Pearl Jam won a Grammy in the category Best Hard Rock Performance in 1996, the band's lead singer Eddie Vedder commented on stage: "I don't know what this means. I don't think it means anything." Glen Hansard, leader of the Irish rock group The Frames, stated in 2008 that the Grammys represent something outside of the real world of music "that's fully industry based". He said he wasn't that interested in attending that year's ceremony, even though he had been nominated for two different awards.
