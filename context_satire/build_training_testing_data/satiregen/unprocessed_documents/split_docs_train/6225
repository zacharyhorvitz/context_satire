Deasismont was born in Norrköping, Sweden as Amy Linnéa Deasismont, the second child of an English father, Lee, and a Swedish mother, Chrisbeth. When she was ten months old, the family moved to England. The family moved back to Sweden when she was four-and-a-half years old, this time to Jönköping. She has an older sister, Danielle; three younger sisters Lisa, Holly, and Lily; and a younger brother, Charlie. Deasismont keeps her private life separate from her singing career. She took the stage name of Amy Diamond when she released her first single, "What's in It for Me". She has said that she chose Diamond because it's her birthstone. In 2010, Diamond took part in the BBC talent-search Over the Rainbow, which aimed to find an actress to play Dorothy in an upcoming production of The Wizard of Oz. Diamond made it through to become one of the top eleven finalists in the competition. In the first week of live performances for the public vote, she sang a rendition of Fergie's "Big Girls Don't Cry" but was eliminated after the vote and Andrew Lloyd Webber's decision. Diamond also took part in a group performance of Love Machine by Girls Aloud with contestants Bronte Barbe, Emilie Fleming, and Jessica Robinson  and in the final show, performed with the former eight Dorothys in a group performance of Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down by Alicia Keys.
