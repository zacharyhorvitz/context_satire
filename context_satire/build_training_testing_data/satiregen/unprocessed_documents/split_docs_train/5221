California University of Pennsylvania traces its roots back to 1852, when the fledgling community of California spent tax money and donations to create an academy for kindergarten through college-level courses. In 1864, it purchased 10 acres (4.0Â ha) and moved to what is now the center of its present location, and a year later the school received a charter to be a normal school. In 1874, the institution was renamed SouthWestern Normal School and in 1914 Pennsylvania bought the school, renaming it the California State Normal School and converted it into a two-year institute for training of elementary school teachers. In 1928 the school restored a full four-year curriculum and was renamed the California State Teachers College. The programs offered were expanded over time and broadened beyond teacher training, and by 1959 the school's name was condensed to California State College. In 1962, the school added a graduate program. The school became a part of the State System of Higher Education on July 1, 1983. Every College House at the University of Pennsylvania has at least four members of faculty in the roles of House Dean, Faculty Master, and College House Fellows. Within the College Houses, Penn has nearly 40 themed residential programs for students with shared interests such as world cinema or science and technology. Many of the nearby homes and apartments in the area surrounding the campus are often rented by undergraduate students moving off campus after their first year, as well as by graduate and professional students.
