FM 108 began to phase out its oldies programming in the fall of 1989 with the addition of dance music programming ("Rhythm Radio") in evenings and overnights; the station continued with its soft AC/MOR format during the rest of the day on weekdays, as "Daytime Lite and Rhythm at Nite." Oldies programming was relegated to Saturdays. The last oldies show on FM 108, hosted by Dale Patterson, aired on September 29, 1990. "Daytime Lite" ended on September 2, 1991, and the dance format expanded full-time (first as "Dance 108", and then to "Energy 108" in the mid-90's). On September 30, 1988, KMGK began stunting with a loop of various versions of the 1960s oldie "Louie, Louie." At Noon on October 3rd, the station was reborn as KQQL "Kool 108." While some FM stations had oldies as part of their playlists, KQQL was the first all-oldies FM station in the Twin Cities area. The first song on Kool 108 was "Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay" by Danny & the Juniors. In 1964, CHML-FM signed on at 95.3 FM, a sister to the AM station of the same callsign. In 1967, the station adopted the new callsign CKDS-FM. For many years, the station aired an easy listening format similar to CING, some of the time under the branding Lite FM 95.3. In September 1991, at the same time as CING was becoming "Dance 108", CKDS changed its callsign to CJXY, and rebranded as Y95 - a classic rock station that became a powerhouse in Southern Ontario.
