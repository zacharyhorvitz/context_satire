 The thought came to Don Walker during that most quintessential of American outings -- a baseball game. Caught in a crush of people on his way into Atlanta's Turner Field, he couldn't help but think about what had just happened in Boston -- sports fans crowded into a small space, a bomb tucked into a backpack, and then death. Not that it stopped the Morgantown, West Virginia, man from enjoying his Atlanta vacation. "You just watch things more closely," he said.  This morning Boston-area hospitals have released at least 100 of the 183 people injured in Monday's Boston Marathon attack. New information has also been released regarding the third person killed - a Chinese graduate student who was studying at Boston University. Dr. Arun Ramappa is an orthopedic surgeon at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He was at his office when he heard about the attack and went to the hospital voluntarily to help out.  This morning the FBI is leading the investigation into the twin bombings at the Boston Marathon. Overnight federal, state and local agencies searched an apartment in Revere, Massachusetts for possible clues. Although they left with bags of evidence, there is no word on any arrests. The attack which occurred on Monday left three people dead and over 150 people wounded.
