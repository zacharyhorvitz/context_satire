In January 2017, Trump resigned from her position at the Trump Organization. The organization also removed images of Trump and her father from their websites, in accordance with official advice on federal ethics rules. In the early months of her father's presidency, some commented that she was filling a quasiâ€“first lady role while First Lady Melania Trump remained in New York City (her son Barron completed the school year in New York before the first lady moved to Washington); Trump stated that she had no intention of being first lady. Initially, it seemed that Donald Trump had not picked an official photographer for his presidential term, but Shealah Craighead was announced in the news media as such, a week after his inauguration. Craighead worked in the White House before, as the photographer for Dick Cheney and Laura Bush. She was campaign photographer for Sarah Palin and Marco Rubio, and was the official photographer at Jenna Bush's wedding. The Chief Official White House Photographer is a senior position appointed by the President of the United States to cover the President's official day-to-day duties. There have been eleven official White House photographers. Since the beginning of the presidency of Donald Trump, the position has been occupied by Shealah Craighead, the second woman to hold the role, and former photographer for Dick Cheney and Laura Bush during the presidency of George W. Bush.
