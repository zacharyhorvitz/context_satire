The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is one of 27 institutes and centers that make up the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH, in turn, is an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services and is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and health-related research. In 1994 The House Appropriations Committee mandated that the director of NIH conduct a review of the role, size, and cost of all NIH intramural research programs (IRP). NIMH and the National Advisory Mental Health Council (NAMHC) initiated a major study of the NIMH Intramural Research Program. The planning committee recommended continued investment in the IRP and recommended specific administrative changes; many of these were implemented upon release of the committee's final report; other changes — for example, the establishment of a major new program on Mood and Anxiety Disorders — have been introduced in the years since. The National Institutes of Health was created on January 26, 1996 by the UP Board of Regents to enhance research undertakings of UP Manila with regards to public health. It serves as an institutional home of a network of researchers and research institutions. Eventually, NIH was established as the national health research center of the Philippines through the Health Research and Development Act of 1998, otherwise known as Republic Act 8503.
