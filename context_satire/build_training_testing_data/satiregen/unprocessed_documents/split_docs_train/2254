Graham talked his future wife, Ruth, into abandoning her ambition to evangelize in Tibet in favor of staying in the United States to marry him â€“ and that to do otherwise would be "to thwart God's obvious will". After Ruth agreed to marry him, Graham cited the Bible for claiming authority over her, saying, "then I'll do the leading and you do the following". Finlay were a five piece indie rock band from London, England. The band was formed in 1996 by school friends Adam Straw, Anamik Saha and Christopher Allison. Lorna Crabbe joined in August 1997 (two weeks before their first gig), and Giles Littleford three years later. They released a single and an EP on their own label, Growl Wow Records, before signing with British independent label Fortuna Pop! Since 2010, Graham has been in a relationship with actor Peter Krause. They first met in 1995 when they both appeared in the sitcom Caroline in the City, then became a couple while playing brother and sister on Parenthood. They live together in Los Angeles.
