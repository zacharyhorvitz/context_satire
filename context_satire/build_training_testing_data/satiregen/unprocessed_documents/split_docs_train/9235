Jubouri survived an assassination attempt on 18 December 2012. Jubouri had been travelling in the Tikrit area in a car with Qotaiba Jubouri, an MP and the Head of Iraqiya Hurra coalition, as part of an inspection of the various districts and villages of Saladin province. When travelling near the village of Albo-Ajeil village a car bomb went off. Both men survived. Ahmad Khalaf al-Dulaimi (Arabic: أحمد خلف الدليمي‎, also Ahmad Khalaf   Muhammad al-Dulaimi, Ahmed Khalaf Dheyabi) is an Iraqi politician and was the Governor of Al Anbar province from August 2013 to December 2014. The Anbar governorate election was held in June 2013, amidst on-going demonstrations in Sunni Arab majority areas. The elections in Anbar were topped by the pro-protest 'Uniters List', which allied the al-Hadba party of Usama al-Nujayfi, the speaker of the Council of Representatives of Iraq with the Iraqi Islamic Party, which had controlled al-Anbar governorate from 2005 to 2009. The previous governor, Qasim Al-Fahdawi, was a businessman who had been nominated by the Awakening parties that had won the 2009 elections. Ahmad Khalaf al-Dulaimi was wounded in the head and chest on September 7, 2014 during an operation against anti-government forces in the town of Barwana, al-Anbar Province. He was flown to Amman, Jordan for treatment, and then to Berlin, Germany. One member of al-Dulaimi's security team and seven soldiers were killed in the attack. In December 2014 the Anbar Provincial Council moved to have the governor retired, and he was replaced by Suhaib al-Rawi.
