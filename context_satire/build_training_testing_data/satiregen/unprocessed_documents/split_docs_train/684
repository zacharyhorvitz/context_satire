Michelle Obama said that her goal was to make this effort her legacy: "I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And my hope is that that's going to be in the area of childhood obesity." Her 2012 book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating. Her call for action on healthy eating was repeated by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of obesity among recruits.  Michelle Obama "has no business" pushing healthier lunches on children, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Monday. Christie made the remark in response to a child's question during a campaign stop in Council Bluffs, Iowa. "What are you going to do about the lunches, because they were fine when Mrs. Bush was the first lady, but now that Mrs. Obama is the first lady, they've gone down," the child told Christie.  Flawless. Powerful. Precise. Poised.
