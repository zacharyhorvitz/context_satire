Two years later, Tasha is now Derwin's agent and appears to be a very successful sports agent, making Derwin a superstar & "the face of Nike", while dating a much younger man named Dant√©. Dante is obviously in love with Tasha but she is leery of letting their romance be witnessed in public so she tells Dante she can do her thing, he can do his thing and they can do their thing together. Meanwhile, she tries to keep Melanie from ruining her marriage to Derwin, as she advised Melanie to let her doubts about DJ go, continue living the happy life and not to answer the phone getting the test results of which Melanie ignored. Tasha resolved her issues with Kelly and threatened to shoot her if the incident (see above) happened again. At the start of season 4, it is revealed that Kelly is now a reality TV star, with her own show centered around the ex-wives of professional athletes. Sporting a new look & attitude, Kelly declares to Jason that she "won" in the divorce because she is spending the money he is earning and she believes she got more out of the divorce material wise. She starts to turn off her friends with the reality show (the cameras constantly following her), and her life starts to spiral out of control. She leaves Jason to take Brittany back and to remind her that he is the reason for her show in the first place. Hodges lives in Los Angeles and is originally from Huntington Woods, Michigan.
