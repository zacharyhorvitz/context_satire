On 24 June 2013, Berlusconi was found guilty of paying an underage prostitute for sex, and of abusing his powers in an ensuing cover up. He was sentenced to seven years in jail, and banned from public office for life. He was acquitted from the sex charges by the Italy appeals court on Friday, 18 July 2014.  A panel of judges Monday sentenced former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to seven years in prison for abusing power and having sex with an underage prostitute. Judges also barred the flamboyant former prime minister from holding public office. The high-profile case centered on an exotic dancer nicknamed "Ruby the heart-stealer." Berlusconi's attorney told reporters he plans to appeal the conviction. On 24 June 2013, Berlusconi was found guilty of paying for sex with an underage prostitute (17-year-old Karima El Mahroug, also known by the stage name Ruby Rubacuori) and of abusing his office. He was sentenced by the Court of First Instance to seven years in prison, one more year than had been requested by the prosecution, and banned from public office for life.
