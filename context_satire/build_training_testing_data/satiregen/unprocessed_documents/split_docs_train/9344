The elected and appointed Board of Directors holds open meetings every two weeks throughout the school year and over the summer semester, though emergency meetings are also called when needed. Twice a year, the general membership meets to review the auditor's report, ratify changes made to the CSA's by-laws by the Board of Directors, and provide ground level participation to the operation of the CSA. The second student "government" was the Committee of College Presidents (OAC, OVC, Mac, and Arts). It was a loose association whose main function was to make sure that social events and some services (such as the Ontarion) would survive. It lasted only three yearsâ€”long enough for the University to take the student money and build the building they'd decided on. The Committee didn't do much except to create a real student government called the University of Guelph Central Student (note the singular "student") Association. By 1970 the University decided that the building would be all that and also house all administration functions as well. Union Council claimed that such a building would violate the terms of the referendum and therefore they should build what the students said they wanted or return the money collected. The University countered by saying that the newly incorporated Union Council (which changed its name to the University of Guelph Student Union) had no say in how the fees collected would be spent, that they didn't "recognize" this new entity as the legitimate student government. At the same time, the University decided that fees paid to the Union Council (which they had collected up to this point and gave over to the new "Student Union" that they claimed had no standing) should be voluntary.
