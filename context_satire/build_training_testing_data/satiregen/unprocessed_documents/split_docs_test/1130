 North Korea has publicly executed the country's defense minister after the regime accused him of treason, according to reports from South Korea on Tuesday. Hyon Yong Chol was killed by fire from an anti-aircraft gun at a military school in front of hundreds of people in Pyongyang, the South Korean Intelligence Service (NIS) was reported to have told parliament members in a closed door session. Hyon was executed because he expressed discontent towards leader Kim Jong Un, and failed to follow Kim's orders on several occasions, according to Kim Gwang-lim, chairman of the National Assembly Intelligence Committee and a lawmaker with the Saenuri Party who attended the briefing. However, on Friday, an official with South Korea's NIS told CNN that while the agency was sure Hyon had been "purged," it had not confirmed whether he had been executed.  When officials informed us that we'd be granted a sit-down interview with a high-ranking member of North Korea's inner circle with no preconditions, it was a real surprise. Senior figures in Pyongyang don't do interviews, especially not with the international press. "I do not like talking to foreign media," Park Yong Chol said frankly as we shook hands ahead of our meeting. He said that we report rumor and fabrication about his country.  Mr. Park shifts uncomfortably in his seat. As one of the most senior North Korean officials to ever defect, he was preparing to tell the ugly truth about the regime he served faithfully for decades. This is not his real name; he wants his identity hidden for fear of retribution against friends and family still in Pyongyang. It's not surprising when you hear what he has to say.
