In 1963, Ramirez fulfilled a promise to take over Miss Bravo's studio upon her retirement. In 1967, with federal funding through an anti-poverty program, she conceived and directed an intensive training program for younger students called "Operation High Hopes." In addition to teaching, Ramirez arranged performances for her young students. While she demanded professional behavior of them, she was aware that there were few opportunities for Latinos in professional dance at the time. In August 2003, Lopez starred opposite Affleck in the romantic comedy Gigli. The film was a box office bomb, and is considered one of the worst films of all time. The film's poor reception was attributed to negative press preceding its release, as well as the media attention surrounding Lopez and Affleck's engagement which largely overshadowed the film. Lopez would later describe this as the lowest point of her career, saying " was very tough", "the tabloid press had just come into existence at the time, so I was like a poster child for that moment." The murder in Texas took place before Ramirez's first known killing. Kit initially speaks with Ramirez by phone through glass; he refuses to reveal anything until they meet in a visitation room. There, he demands she remove her gold jewelry; he says that he is a Satanist, and gold is offensive to Satan because it is God's metal. He remains uncooperative because guards are in the room, but suggests that they can have privacy if she says she's his lawyer.
