In the first four seasons, Showtime's original competition format was that three groups, each made up of two to twenty-five members (with no age limit), perform a single performance, either a dance and/or song number. Before the performance, one group member is given twenty seconds to make an introduction before ending with the phrase "It's Showtime!". After the group's performance, the hurados and the studio audiences will rate the group from 1 to 10. The group with the highest average scores from the hurados wins the competition. The first episode of the series, "Pilot", was watched by 982,000 viewers, making it the network's biggest turnout for a series premiere since Dead Like Me in 2003. The episode airing January 30, "Casey Casden", received 1.45 million total viewers, making Shameless the best performing first-year drama on Showtime. Most episodes begin with one of the main characters who breaks the fourth wall to berate the viewer about missing previous episodes. Then the show cuts to a recap montage of plot points relevant to the current episode, followed by the opening title sequence.
