 General Mills is planning to use only cage-free eggs in its U.S. products. The maker of products like Cheerios, Yoplait yogurt and Pillsbury baking doughs will stop buying eggs that come from caged hens, the company announced Tuesday. The company did not reveal when it would make the switch. General Mills' sourcing director, Steve Peterson, said the company sees it as a "long-term goal." Beginning in 1929, General Mills products contained box top coupons, known as Betty Crocker coupons, with varying point values, which were redeemable for discounts on a variety of housewares products featured in the widely distributed Betty Crocker catalog. The coupons and the catalog were discontinued by the company in 2006. A similar program, Box Tops for Education, in which coupon icons clipped off various General Mills products can be redeemed by schools for cash, started in 1996 and is still active. Since 2004, General Mills has been producing more products targeted to the growing ranks of health-conscious consumers. The company has chosen to switch its entire breakfast cereal line to whole grain. The company also started manufacturing their child-targeted cereals with less sugar. General Mills has reduced the level of sugar in all cereals advertised to children to 11 grams per serving.
