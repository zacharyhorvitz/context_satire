At the tournament in Indian Wells, California, in March, Davenport made history by defeating world no. 3 Maria Sharapova, 6–0, 6–0. It marked the first time that a player ranked in the top 3 had ever been "shut out" on the WTA tour and was the first time Sharapova had failed to win a game during a match. This turned out to be Davenport's only career victory against Sharapova. Davenport married Jon Leach, a Morgan Stanley investment banker and former University of Southern California All-American tennis player, on April 25, 2003 in Hawaii. Jon Leach is the brother of her former coach Rick Leach. Davenport took a break from competitive tennis in late 2006 and much of 2007 to have a baby. In 2007, she gave birth to a son in Newport Beach, California. At the first Grand Slam tournament of the year, the Australian Open, Davenport lost in the second round to eventual champion Maria Sharapova, 1–6, 3–6. This was the first time that Davenport had lost to Sharapova in straight sets.
