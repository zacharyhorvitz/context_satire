On May 4, 2008, it was announced that GE would auction off its appliances business for an expected sale of $5–8 billion. However, this plan fell through as a result of the recession. In mid December 2008, GE Money announced it was in advanced talks with the National Australia Bank (NAB) to sell the Wizard Brand. Ultimately, Wizard was bought by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. On the 24th of October 2008, GE Money announced that it will cease offering motor finance in Australia and New Zealand. This move has proven damaging to GE aligned dealerships who have been given 60 days to find an alternate financier to provide floorplan finance. GE Money also announced that it will be pulling out of the mortgage industry and no longer providing mortgages other than those sold under the Wizard Brand.
