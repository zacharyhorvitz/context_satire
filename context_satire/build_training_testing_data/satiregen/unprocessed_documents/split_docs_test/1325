Various campaigns criticized the change. Sanders senior adviser Jeff Weaver stated that "to now change the rules in the middle of the game to accommodate Mike Bloomberg, who is trying to buy his way into the Democratic nomination, is wrong. That’s the definition of a rigged system”. Yang tweeted that "aving Americans willing to invest in your campaign is a key sign of a successful campaign. Bloomberg’s campaign manager Kevin Sheekey described his campaign as "thrilled that voters could soon have the chance to see Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage, hear his vision for the country, and see why he is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump and bring our country together. Mike has run for office three times and never taken a dime from special interests, allowing him to act independently, on the merits, without having to do what donors expect. He is proud to be doing the same with this campaign." After the debate, at a rally in Salt Lake City, Utah, Bloomberg stated of the debate: "Trump was the real winner of Las Vegas debate" and "If we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base like Senator Sanders, it will be a fatal error." Bloomberg's campaign staff manager Kevin Sheekey stated that he believed it was ultimately a success for Bloomberg, stating "You know you are a winner when you are drawing attacks from all the candidates. Everyone came to destroy Mike tonight, it didn't happen. Everyone wanted him to lose his cool.
