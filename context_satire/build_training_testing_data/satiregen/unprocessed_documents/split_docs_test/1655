Eric notices a dog staring at him from outside, and recognizes the dog as a pet that had died when he was younger. He then returns to the crash site and experiences frightening memories. Meanwhile, Shannon is the only one at the next session. Eric arrives and Claire takes him and Shannon to her apartment. After his release, despite a protective order in effect, Wrinkles went looking for Debra. He showed up at her place of employment, and at the homes of two of her friends, demanding to see her. He was unsuccessful each time. On July 20, 1994, Wrinkles, his wife, and their attorneys met for a provisional hearing in their divorce proceeding. The boys are nearly caught and Eric gets in his car, chasing them to the outskirts of the town. The boys narrowly avoid a deer that wanders onto the road but, Eric hits the deer and crashes into a tree. The boys argue about whether to call for help, as he is still breathing,  but leave the scene hoping that someone would pass along soon. The next day, word spreads through the town that Eric succumbed to his injuries and has died.
