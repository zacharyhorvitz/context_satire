In July 2008, Christian Bale was filming a scene in New Mexico for the film Terminator Salvation with actress Bryce Dallas Howard. The film's director of photography, Shane Hurlbut, walked into Bale's line of sight, and the actor proceeded to yell obscenities at Hurlbut. Bale said he would quit the film if Hurlbut repeated the error and was not subsequently fired. Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident.  While most celebrities who attended the Oscars Sunday night slipped into their second look of the evening before hitting up the after-parties, Melissa McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone had something else in mind. The couple turned up at Vanity Fair's bash wearing matching Adidas tracksuits. "It's not  to me guys," she told Entertainment Tonight before entering the party. "I've doubled my diamonds -- I feel great."  With the 2019 awards calendar reaching its grand finale at the Oscars Sunday evening, so too does a season of show-stopping red carpet fashion. While the tone was relatively restrained -- compared with the bold statements of recent award ceremonies, at least -- many stars had saved their best for last. All eyes were on the best actress nominees as they arrived at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood from mid-afternoon. Lady Gaga evoked the spirit of vintage Hollywood in a stunning black Alexander McQueen dress.
