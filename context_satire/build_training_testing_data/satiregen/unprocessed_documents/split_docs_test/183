 Ted Cruz started the month riding high in Iowa. Now, he just wants to get out of the state alive. The self-styled rock-ribbed conservative is under siege, battling attacks from his right and left flanks who say the Texas senator with tea party and evangelical credentials isn't who he claims to be. And as Cruz appears to be falling farther behind front-runner Donald Trump, his campaign is now looking in the rear-view mirror, concerned that Marco Rubio and the rest of the GOP field are closing in.  The biggest elephant wasn't in the room -- so Ted Cruz stood center stage, taking punches from his opponents and the moderators. But how much did this matter? The Fox News debate Thursday night exposed few new rifts between the contenders and featured candidates mostly sticking to message. Donald Trump was elsewhere, and here's what he missed:  It's time to vote.  Marco Rubio's complicated path to the GOP nomination comes down to this: attrition. The Floridian is betting that the race will eventually turn into a one-on-one slugfest between him and Donald Trump -- and that the party will coalesce behind him as other establishment-backed candidates drop out, according to interviews with donors, advisers and allies of Rubio. But unlike Jeb Bush, Rubio is in no hurry to engage The Donald -- at least not yet. He's betting Ted Cruz, who has staked much of his campaign on winning in Iowa, will lose to Trump next week here in the caucuses, seriously blunting the Texas Republican's momentum in the rest of February's primaries and undermining his candidacy.
