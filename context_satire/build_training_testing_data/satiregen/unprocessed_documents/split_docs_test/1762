First Presbyterian's original pastor was James Anderson, who had been preaching in New York to the small-but-growing Scots population, whose influence increased with the appointment of a number of Scotsmen to be Governors of the New York colony. During the American Revolution, the church became known as the "Church of Patriots" due to many from its congregation being involved in the effort against Great Britain. Their dissatisfaction partly arose partly because the King had consistently refused to issue the Church a charter in 1766 and afterwards, claiming a duty to uphold the exclusive rights of the Church of England, represented in New York by Trinity Church. First Presbyterian's pastor from 1765 to 1811, John Rodgers, had to leave the city during the British occupation because of his activities. In 1833, Lyman Beecher was called as pastor of Second Presbyterian and president of Lane Theological Seminary. During his tenure in town, he had a falling out with Joshua Lacy Wilson, the pastor of First Presbyterian. Wilson eventually charged Beecher with heresy. Though Beecher was acquitted by the higher governing bodies of the church, his ministry was compromised, and he left in 1843. In 1918, First Presbyterian merged with the Presbyterian churches of Madison Square and University Place, forming what was then known as "“The First Presbyterian Church in the City of New York, Founded 1716 – Old First, University Place and Madison Square Foundation," but referred to colloquially as "New York’s Presbyterian cathedral." That same year, Harry Emerson Fosdick assumed the role of pastor of First Presbyterian Church. Fosdick proved to be a charismatic preacher and resulted in the growth of the congregation. The increased size of the congregation necessitated the lengthening of the church in 1919, with the addition of a chancel.
