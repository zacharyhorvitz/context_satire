Like the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Later that afternoon, Pelosi held a rare public "engrossment ceremony", followed by a stately procession of the managers and other House officers across the Capitol building where the third impeachment of a US president was announced to the senate. With the exception of the managers, who will conduct the trial, the House's involvement in the impeachment process came to an end.  Twenty-one people who worked for the Trump Organization while undocumented have asked to meet with President Donald Trump to address immigration policy reform and request deportation relief, the Washington Post reported. The Post on Wednesday obtained a letter from former Trump Organization golf course groundskeepers, maids and kitchen staff -- some who worked there for 10 years -- asking the President to "do the right thing to find a home for us here in America so that we can step out of the shadows and not deport us and our friends and family." "We are modest people who represent the dreams of the 11 million undocumented men, women and children who live and work in this country," the group wrote in the letter shared by the Post. "We love America and want to talk to you about helping to give us a chance to become legal."
