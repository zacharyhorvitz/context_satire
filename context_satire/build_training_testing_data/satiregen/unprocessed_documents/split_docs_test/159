 When it comes to Iran and the West, the relationship has been convoluted for decades. And this deal is no different. After days of negotiations, six world powers and Tehran reached an agreement that calls on Iran to limit its nuclear activities in return for lighter sanctions. It's complicated politics coupled with complicated science.  The diplomatic gridlock between Iran and the West seemed immovable for decades. But on Sunday, diplomats made history when Iran and six world powers came together on an agreement over Iran's nuclear program. The deal dials back Iran's ability to work toward a nuclear weapon and at the same time loosens the choke hold of international sanctions on Iran's economy. The two sides now have six months to find out how historic the breakthrough really is.  It is the first major international agreement on Iran's nuclear ambitions after a decade of failed efforts, and follows the first notable thaw in U.S-Iranian relations in 34 years. Iran reaches nuclear deal with world leaders -- now what? Then why are so many people at home and around the world so angry, or at least concerned, about the six-month deal reached over the weekend by negotiators in Geneva? The reasons are as numerous and complex as the diverse assortment of critics, including Israel and Arab powers who remain technically at war, as well as congressional Republicans and some leading Democrats.
