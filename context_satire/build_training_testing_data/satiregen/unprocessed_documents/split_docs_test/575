 President Donald Trump laid out his strategy in Afghanistan in an address to the nation Monday night, saying the US would fight to win its longest war in part by boosting troop levels to an unspecified degree. Trump also said conditions "on the ground," instead of timetables, would guide strategy, and laid out in broad strokes how he intends to deal with Pakistan and the South Asia region. In case you missed it, here are some of the most notable lines from Trump's speech at Fort Myer in Arlington, Virginia. "When one citizen suffers an injustice, we all suffer together"  Trump called out prejudice and bigotry at the beginning of his speech -- seemingly an attempt to address bipartisan criticisms of his response to the racial violence that beset the country last week.  America is trying to learn the lessons of its post-9/11 wars. And in his speech to the nation Monday evening, Donald Trump, the third US President to grapple with the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, promised not nation-building, but terror-pursuing. Most importantly to those in Afghanistan and those in Washington who long argued for America's sustained involvement in the country, he also announced a longer-term commitment to the war-scarred nation, shaped not by timelines in Washington but facts on the ground in Afghanistan. This was the kind of speech that Afghan officials I have spoken with over the last decade have long hoped for -- and one that Afghan hands at the State Department had long hoped their president would give.  President Donald Trump will outline the United States' "path forward" in Afghanistan in a speech Monday night, the White House announced Sunday. Trump's address, scheduled for 9 p.m. ET Monday at Fort Myer in Arlington, Virginia, comes as Trump and Secretary of Defense James Mattis have said a decision has been made on a new US strategy in Afghanistan. Earlier Sunday, Mattis confirmed a decision has been made, but declined to offer details about the decision, saying Trump would choose when to make the announcement.
