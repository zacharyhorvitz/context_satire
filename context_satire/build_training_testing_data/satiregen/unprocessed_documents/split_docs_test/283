 Fox News might be backing down from its campaign against "no-go zones," but Bobby Jindal isn't. And now the Louisiana governor's political action committee is taking up the cause. Stand Up to Washington PAC, which was launched by Jindal last year with a mission to send more conservatives to Capitol Hill, urged supporters on Wednesday to stand up to the "liberal media" and sign a petition in solidarity with the potential 2016 contender. "Tell the liberal media to stop their shameless attacks against Governor Jindal for telling the truth about radical Islam," reads the page on the PAC's website.  Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Monday stood by his criticism of so-called "no-go" zones in Europe, where sovereign nations allegedly cede authority to Muslim immigrants, a controversial idea that many critics say is overblown. And the potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate decried what he called immigrants' insistence on "non-assimilation, the fact that "you've got people who want to come to our country but not adopt our values," which he called "dangerous." Jindal has the reputation of policy wonk among Republicans and boldly told GOP officials during a 2013 address to the Republican National Committee that they "must stop being the stupid party" and needed to "stop insulting the intelligence of voters."  Readers of presidential tea leaves often look for several signs that someone is planning to run for the White House: trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, the release of non-controversial memoirs, and in recent years, the creation of various patriotically named political committees on his or her behalf. At this early stage of the 2016 presidential race, no major candidates have actually declared their candidacies or set up their official presidential campaigns, but several possible contenders have established, or had established on their behalf, a variety of political organizations that might best be described as their "pre-campaign committees." Republican Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin launched a 527 called "Our American Revival" on Tuesday.
