 A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that the Terrorist Screening Database violates the constitutional rights of American citizens who are on it, deciding in favor of 23 citizens who sued after being placed on the watchlist. The ruling from Judge Anthony Trenga in the Eastern District of Virginia calls into question federal authorities' practice of using the list to support decisions on people's ability to travel. While Wednesday's ruling is significant, Trenga set up a bigger battle in the weeks ahead. The judge ordered both sides of the case to come up with arguments for what should happen next following his decision and those arguments could influence the fate of the database and the federal government's process.  It's been 18 years since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the day that never ends. Events in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania -- each of which saw destruction and disaster that day -- will be held on Wednesday to remember the victims and first responders. Nearly 3,000 people died when hijackers took control of four commercial airplanes and crashed them into the World Trade Center buildings, the Pentagon, and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. More have died since from illnesses related to the destruction.  Pope Francis, who has tussled with the American president, American capitalists and American Catholics during his six years as pope, seems unfazed by the disputes. In fact, he may even enjoy them. In a brief exchange with a French journalist aboard the papal plane to Africa on Wednesday, Francis said he was honored by criticisms from conservative Catholics in the United States. "For me it is an honor that Americans attack me," he told Nicolas Sen√®ze of Catholic media outlet La Croix, who has written a new book called "How America Wants to Change Popes."
