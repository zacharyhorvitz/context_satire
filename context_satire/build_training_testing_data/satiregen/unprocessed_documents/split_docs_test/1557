 Supporters of the Chicago Teachers Union rallied Saturday on the sixth day of a strike that has shut down the city's schools, even as a deal with the school board was in the works. Both sides expressed optimism that students could be back in school by Monday, but the massive gathering was a reminder that until a deal is signed, the strike is not over. "We don't have an agreement, we have a framework for an agreement," union President Karen Lewis reiterated at the rally Saturday at Union Park. Joining the thousands of teachers at the rally were parents and students who declared their solidarity with them.  The Chicago Teachers Union and the city's school board reached a tentative agreement Friday in their dispute over new contract terms that has closed public schools for 350,000 students. Despite the possible deal, union president Karen Lewis cautioned that the strike, in its fifth day Friday, is not yet over. Union officials will meet between now and Sunday to draft specific language on a "framework for an agreement." They will present the document to a special committee of union representatives, at which time a majority vote will be taken on whether to suspend the strike.  New hope has emerged for ending the Chicago teachers strike that has closed public schools for 350,000 students. Chicago Teachers Union spokeswoman Stephanie Gadlin said union delegates with the power to stop the walkout would meet on Friday at 2 p.m. CT. There will be no classes Friday, the fifth day of the strike, Gadlin said Thursday. The union and the school board met late into the night on Wednesday with the parties emerging more optimistic than in previous negotiating sessions.
