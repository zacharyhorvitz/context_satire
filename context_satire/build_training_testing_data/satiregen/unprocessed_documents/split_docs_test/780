 President Donald Trump has a lot to say about the ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian meddling into the 2016 campaign. He's called it a "phony Russian Witch Hunt" and the "Russia hoax" story. Trump's lawyers have been building what amounts to an opposition research file on Robert Mueller, the head of the special counsel investigation, and the rest of his team. By contrast, Mueller and his investigators have been totally silent.  President Donald Trump told reporters on Thursday that he hasn't given firing special counsel Robert Mueller any thought, despite people close to him telling reporters that the President is considering firing the man investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election. "I haven't given it any thought," he said. "I've been reading about it from you people. You say, 'Oh, I'm going to dismiss him.' After the news broke out in late January 2018, that Trump ordered Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller in June 2017, Trump pressured McGahn to deny the reports. "After the story broke, the President, through his personal counsel and two aides, sought to have McGahn deny that he had been directed to remove the Special Counsel," the report reads. Trump told then-White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter to tell McGahn to create a record that makes clear Trump never directed McGahn to fire the Special Counsel. "Porter thought the matter should be handled by the White House communications office, but the President said he wanted McGahn to write a letter to the file 'for our records' and wanted something beyond a press statement to demonstrate that the reporting was inaccurate.
