 Sen. Rand Paul was supposed to be on stage at Monday night's Voters First Forum in New Hampshire. But the vote on his bill to defund Planned Parenthood made it impossible to get to the event in time. So instead, Paul and Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz found themselves in a television studio in Washington, beamed in by satellite to appear with 11 other GOP candidates at St. Anselm.  Iowa has long been the must-win state for Scott Walker, but the growing threat of Donald Trump has the Wisconsin governor's team fortifying its battlements in the state. The super PAC backing Walker, Unintimidated PAC, told CNN Wednesday that it was buying $7 million of air time in Iowa and starting to saturate the airwaves in September, a major marker. The PAC is also planning to announce buys soon in Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Walker has long led most polls of Republican caucusgoers in Iowa, starting from his breakout speech at the Iowa Freedom Summit this  past January. During the latter part of 2015, Rubio's voting record in the senate came under scrutiny. Jeb Bush, during the CNBC debate on October 28, told Rubio that he could either campaign or resign, Rubio responding that Bush had not made similar comments about the voting record of John McCain during his 2008 presidential campaign and concluded that Bush was only criticizing "because we're running for the same position and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you." In December, while in Iowa, fellow presidential candidate Chris Christie mentioned Rubio missing a vote on a national spending bill the senator opposed and added, "Just show up to work and vote no, and like if you don't want to, then quit." On December 29, Rubio responded to Christie by claiming to have close to a 90% attendance record while also retorting that the governor had "been missing in New Jersey half of the time."
