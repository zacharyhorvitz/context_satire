 Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who died Wednesday at 56, made the world "immeasurably better," the company's board of directors said in a statement. The company also released an e-mail sent to Apple employees in which CEO Tim Cook announced Jobs' death, saying, "Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple."  President Barack Obama, who has enjoyed Apple's products along with millions of other Americans, Wednesday night hailed Steve Jobs as one of America's greatest innovators, a man "brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it." "The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented," the president said in a statement. Praising Jobs' breadth and the impact of his work from personal computers to iPhones to movie production, the president added, "Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last.  iSad. That was the reaction of many as millions took to the web with the news of the death of 56-year-old Steve Jobs. Facebook and Twitter messages were filled with links and anecdotes about the impact technology -- and more specifically, Apple -- had on users' lives. Apple invited people to email their thoughts, memories and condolences after announcing Jobs' death Wednesday, saying the company lost a "visionary and creative genius and the world has lost an amazing human being."
