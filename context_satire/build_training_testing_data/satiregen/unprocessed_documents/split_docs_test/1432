 Sen. Tim Kaine mischaracterized the Clinton Foundation's donation policy during a recent interview, saying it no longer accepts foreign and corporate money when, in fact, it has only pledged to renounce these sources of funding if Hillary Clinton is elected president. "She is taking one step forward right now, the foundation is taking one step forward right now by saying there's no corporations, no foreign-connected contributions taking right now," Kaine told Newsnet5, an Ohio television station Monday. "And then, if we are successful and are elected, President  Clinton will sever the tie with the foundation  created." Kaine's comments are incorrect.  For Donald Trump, this was supposed to be a week in which he established himself as the only presidential candidate fit to serve as commander in chief. But that's not working out so easily for the Republican presidential nominee. Trump is back at the center of controversy following an NBC News forum Wednesday in which he praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, falsely asserted he opposed the Iraq War, seemed to criticize US generals, politicized nonpartisan intelligence briefings and stood by a tweet that implied military sexual assault is the result of women in the armed forces. RELATED: Trump defends tweet on military sexual assault Hillary Clinton pounced on Trump's performance at the event, escalating the battle between the two candidates with less than three weeks before they appear on stage together for the first time to debate.  Hillary Clinton has advantages heading into the final stretch of the campaign that any presidential candidate would envy: a fleet of popular surrogates, a mountain of cash and an opponent who is often sidetracked by self-inflicted wounds. Yet the Democratic nominee enters this home stretch in a dead heat against Donald Trump, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday. The close contest heading into the fall underscores Clinton's vulnerabilities on trust and honesty -- and her need to summon a relentless and efficient ground game, even if many of her voters are fueled more by revulsion toward Trump than excitement about her. But in many ways, the nation's changing demographics make this Clinton's race to lose.
