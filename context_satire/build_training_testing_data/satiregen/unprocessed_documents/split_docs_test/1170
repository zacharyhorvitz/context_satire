 A Dallas police officer stands charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a man she mistakenly thought was in her apartment, but a prosecutor would not rule out a more serious charge Monday. "The grand jury will be that entity that will make the final decision in terms of the charge or charges that will come out of this case," Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson told reporters. "We prepare to present a thorough case to the grand jury of Dallas County, so that the right decision can be made in this case." How everyday racial profiling hurts everyone Amber Guyger, who is white, was off-duty when she shot Botham Shem Jean, a black man, in his apartment, police said Thursday.  Right now, there are far more questions than answers about the September 6 shooting at an apartment complex in Dallas, Texas. What little we do know is unquestionably tragic -- heartbreaking. It is also beyond dispute that a white officer killed an unarmed black man. Yet we do not yet know nearly enough to conclude or speculate, as a flood of news stories and tweets do, that this shooting was motivated by racial profiling.  The Texas Rangers have postponed seeking a warrant on manslaughter charges against an officer who shot and killed a man in Dallas, police said Saturday. Police also identified the officer as Amber Guyger, a four-year veteran of the department assigned to the Southeast Patrol Division. The decision comes one day after Dallas Police Chief Ulysha Renee Hall said police were pursing a manslaughter warrant against the officer in a case she described as having "more questions than answers." Thursday, Hall said the officer, who is white, shot the black man after mistakenly entering his apartment at the complex where she also lived.
