 President Donald Trump is cleaning house in the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secret Service Director Randolph "Tex" Alles have been ousted, and at least two officials have been named as possibly heading out the door: US Citizenship and Immigration Services director Francis Cissna and Office of the General Counsel's John Mitnick. "There is a near-systematic purge happening at the nation's second-largest national security agency," an official told CNN. At least some of the sudden personnel changes come at the urging of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, who played a key role in Nielsen's ouster.  President Donald Trump announced Sunday that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen would be leaving her role in the Trump administration. The departure comes as department and immigration officials have claimed that an influx of migrants attempting to come in to the US has pushed their systems at a breaking point, leading Trump to declare a national emergency and threaten to shut down the southern border earlier this month. While Trump said Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan will fill Nielsen's role in an acting capacity, a number of names are being floated for the agency's permanent replacement. Though, as one White House official told CNN's Pamela Brown, there's also concern no one will want to serve as Nielsen's replacement.  Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security who has become a face of President Donald Trump's hardline immigration push, is leaving the administration, President Donald Trump announced on Twitter Sunday afternoon. "Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service," Trump said on Twitter. "I am pleased to announce that Kevin McAleenan, the current U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, will become Acting Secretary for @DHSgov. I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!"
