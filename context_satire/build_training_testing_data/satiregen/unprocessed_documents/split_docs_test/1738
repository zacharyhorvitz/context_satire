 Hillary Clinton invited Elizabeth Warren to join her at a rally Monday in Cincinnati, Ohio, a trip marking the first time the two will appear together on the campaign trail. The event, which will be Clinton's third trip to Ohio in two weeks, is sure to stoke the speculation that the Massachusetts senator could be the former secretary of state's vice presidential pick. The two Democratic leaders, a campaign release said, "will discuss their shared commitment to building an America that is stronger together and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top." Clinton and her top aides are currently narrowing her choices for a running mate, intently focusing on a handful of potential candidates as her team closes in on the final weeks of vetting before she makes a decision in less than a month, according to several Democrats with knowledge of the decision.  Hillary Clinton has one big advantage over Donald Trump heading into November: hindsight. Every step of her 2016 campaign -- from her embrace of the historic nature of her candidacy to her more personal connections with voters -- seems to be an acknowledgment that she's learned the lessons of her failed campaign eight years earlier. The efforts may be working. A national Washington Post/ABC News poll released Sunday found her leading Trump 51%-39% while a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey found her five points ahead.  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders appeared to admit defeat to Hillary Clinton in the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination Wednesday. "It doesn't appear that I'm going to be the nominee," Sanders said in an interview on C-SPAN. Sanders continued to campaign through the final primary election -- which was held in Washington, D.C., last week -- despite Clinton clinching the needed number of pledged delegates the prior week. After losing to Clinton in D.C., Sanders spoke to supporters in a web address and pledged to continue his campaign's fight to the convention, but also vowed to help Clinton defeat Donald Trump.
