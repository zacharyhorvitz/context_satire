 In the fall of 2008, as Sen. Joe Biden pondered the delicate task of debating Gov. Sarah Palin, his debate team honchos circulated an internal preparation memo. The first sentence: "No candidate for president or vice president in the history of the country has had more advice on what to say than Sen. Biden has on his debate with Sarah Palin." Biden's then chief of staff Ted Kaufman, who's been friends with Biden for 40 years and was a part of that debate prep, recalled the line to CNN.  This morning, Newark Mayor Cory Booker tells Soledad O'Brien on "Starting Point" what he's looking forward to seeing in tonight's highly anticipated vice presidential debate with Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan. The pressure is focused in particular on Biden, who many expect will have to do the heavy lifting in terms of changing momentum after President Obama's much-criticized debate performance against Mitt Romney. "If you want an authentic politician, there's no more raw, authentic politics than you get from the vice president," Booker says. "He is who he is.  Paul Ryan has a constant companion on the campaign trail -- a weighty burden he clearly can't live without. It's an oversized, well-worn brown briefcase that holds about 40 pounds of paperwork that he's been studying nonstop to prepare for his debate with Vice President Joe Biden. Ryan sat down for an exclusive interview with CNN to give some insight into how he is getting ready for his 90-minute face-off. As he held the bulging briefcase in his lap, he told us that this is the way he has gotten ready for moments large and small his whole life: intense study.
