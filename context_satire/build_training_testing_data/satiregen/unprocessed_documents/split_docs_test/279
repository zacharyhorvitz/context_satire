 Wednesday is National Day, a day for all Chinese to celebrate the People's Republic of China. Yes, dignitaries gathered and ceremonies took place to mark the holiday in Hong Kong. But the national pride mixed with profound dissent as pro-democracy protesters occupied parts of the Asian business hub -- not to celebrate the central government in Beijing, but to denounce and challenge it. LIVE BLOG: Follow CNN's coverage of the protests There was a sense, entering Wednesday, that the protest ranks could swell with more people off work for the holiday.  The Hong Kong government said Monday that riot police have pulled back from pro-democracy demonstrations around the city that have caused widespread disruption in one of Asia's financial hubs. Defiant demonstrators remained on the streets of Hong Kong's financial center, blocking traffic on key highways a day after clashes with police that left more than 40 people injured. Explaining the decision to withdraw the riot police, the government said in a statement that the protesters on the streets were now behaving peacefully. But protesters have pointed out that the unrest Sunday resulted from heavy-handed police tactics.  Pro-democracy activists took their fight Thursday to the doorstep of Hong Kong's chief executive, sitting down outside his office gates to express their dissatisfaction with him and the central government in Beijing. Some demonstrators say the next step could be occupying the inside of government buildings. It would be a drastic move, but one protest leader says it might be necessary to get officials' attention and bring change. "We still can't get a normal, acceptable response," student leader Joshua Wong, 17, told CNN's Andrew Stevens.
