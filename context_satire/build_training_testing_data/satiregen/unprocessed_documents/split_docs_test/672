 President Barack Obama defended the Senate Intelligence Committee's decision Tuesday to release a controversial torture report, arguing that while there was never a "perfect" time to release the report, it's important to publicly admit that the country made mistakes. "One of the things that sets us apart from other countries is when we make mistakes, we admit them," Obama said in an interview with "Telemundo" on Tuesday that aired simultaneously on Univision. "We did some things that violated who we are as a people," he added. The report, which details the CIA's extreme interrogation techniques used on terrorists after the September 11th attacks, was released by the Senate Intelligence Committee despite a last-minute pleas from Secretary of State John Kerry and members of Congress not to release the information to the public at this time, fearing that its release could spark global attacks against Americans.  The Senate Intelligence Committee report into the CIA's brutal interrogation tactics against detainees captured after the September 11, 2001, attacks is drawing mostly criticism from around the world. While the initial overseas reaction from both United States' allies as well as its enemies was largely muted, the revelations of the intelligence agency's use of "enhanced interrogation techniques" in the post-9/11 era have been widely condemned. The report found CIA tactics were more brutal than previously known and accused the agency of keeping the Bush White House and Congress in the dark. Afghanistan Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani condemned the "inhumane actions" outlined in the report and told reporters in Kabul Wednesday that the document "unfortunately shows that our Afghan compatriots had been tortured."  The CIA's harsh interrogations of terrorist detainees during the Bush era didn't work, were more brutal than previously revealed and delivered no "ticking time bomb" information that prevented an attack, according to an explosive Senate report released Tuesday. The majority report issued by the Senate Intelligence Committee is a damning condemnation of the tactics -- branded by critics as torture -- the George W. Bush administration deployed in the fear-laden days after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The techniques, according to the report, were "deeply flawed," poorly managed and often resulted in "fabricated" information. The report is reigniting the partisan divide over combating terrorism that dominated Washington a decade ago.
