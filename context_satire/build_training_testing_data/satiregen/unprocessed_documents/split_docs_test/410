Paul was one of John's earliest victims, chosen because he attempted suicide by cutting his wrists despite having a good life with a wife and kids. Paul was placed in a large cage lined with a maze of razor wire and was given two hours to crawl his way to freedom; ironically if Paul wanted to live, he would be forced to cut himself again, but if he wanted to die, all he had to do was wait. Paul attempts to escape, but dies from his injuries before reaching the exit. Paul is later seen in Saw IV leaving Jill's drug clinic. Shortly after her stint on American Idol, Reinhart participated in VH1's Do Something Awards. She had already been working with Habitat for Humanity and Starkey Hearing Foundation, and she attended the Do Something Awards to become involved with charities that help fight domestic violence and bullying. Reinhart explains "I've been the counselor to a lot of my friends growing up, so helping people comes naturally to me. Thatâ€™s what all of us are meant to do: send out good vibes, good messages and help out." She attended Mark Twain Elementary School, O.W. Holmes Middle School, and Wheeling High School. While in high school, Reinhart was first introduced to Jazz music after becoming a part of the school's vocal group called Midnight Blues. She eventually performed at the 2009 Montreux Jazz Festival and Umbria Jazz Festival with her high school's jazz band, of which she was the first ever permanent singer.
