 All Katherine McMillan wanted in a shoe was style and comfort without the frilly bows or flowers. She's a working mother who tends to buy men's shirts in small sizes and prefers the kinds of casual shoes made for men -- desert boots, moccasins, chukkas. She'll take a pair of shoes or a jacket in olive green or navy blue over lavender or aqua any day. "I think a lot of my friends would agree that we don't want to look like an Easter egg when we go out," said McMillan, who lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Minneapolis ( (listen)) is the county seat of Hennepin County and the larger of the Twin Cities, the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States. As of 2018, Minneapolis is the largest city in the state of Minnesota and 46th-largest in the United States, with an estimated population of 425,403. The Twin Cities metropolitan area consists of Minneapolis, its neighbor Saint Paul and suburbs which altogether contain about 3.63 million people, and is the third-largest economic and population center in the Midwest.Minneapolis lies on both banks of the Mississippi River, just north of the river's confluence with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Saint Paul, the state's capital. The city is abundantly rich in water, with 13 lakes, wetlands, the Mississippi River, creeks and waterfalls; many connected by parkways in the Chain of Lakes and the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway. Boston (UK: , US: ) is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States, and the 21st most populous city in the United States. The city proper covers 49 square miles (127 km2) with an estimated population of 694,583 in 2018, also making it the most populous city in New England. Boston is the seat of Suffolk County as well, although the county government was disbanded on July 1, 1999. The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.8 million people in 2016 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country.
