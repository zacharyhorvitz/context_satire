 It's not clear if the Boston Marathon bombing suspects -- identified as brothers from the Russian Caucasus who moved to the United States several years ago -- were radicalized as a result of their ethnic Chechen roots. But the question is bound to arise. Whatever emerges about the brothers' ties to Russia's North Caucasus region it's a part of the world that's no stranger to violence or terrorism. The troubled region includes the Russian republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria and North Ossetia.  This morning the FBI is leading the investigation into the twin bombings at the Boston Marathon. Overnight federal, state and local agencies searched an apartment in Revere, Massachusetts for possible clues. Although they left with bags of evidence, there is no word on any arrests. The attack which occurred on Monday left three people dead and over 150 people wounded.  Investigators are tracking down some two-thousand leads this morning in their search for information regarding the Boston Marathon bombings. There are also new reports this morning that Boston-area hospitals have released at least 100 of the 183 people injured in Monday's attack. New details about the lives of the three people killed including a Chinese graduate student who was studying at Boston University are coming out as well. This morning Congressman Patrick Meehan (R-PA) joins “Starting Point.” Meehan serves as the chair of the House Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee and was briefed about the Boston Marathon bombing on Monday.
