 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has a decision to make. In the wake of two mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 people dead, the Senate's leading Republican -- a 35-year public servant who has earned a reputation as being hardened to the criticisms of Democrats and who relishes stopping House legislation at the Senate's edge -- is grappling with how his party can respond to a changing moment in American politics on guns. Not just in Washington, but back home in Kentucky, McConnell is facing the kind of pressure that were it on any other member, might shift momentum even incrementally. At a vigil outside his office Tuesday night, more than 100 protesters gathered.  Since two more mass shootings left more than two dozen people dead in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio this past weekend, Americans—from left, right and center -- have been amplifying their demands that someone do something, anything, to end America's long national nightmare of gun violence. Like, perhaps, bring two bipartisan laws for background checks regulating gun sales—which have already passed the House of Representatives-- to the Senate floor. But that's not happening, thanks in large part to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell may have been elected to represent the state of Kentucky, but he works hard to make sure that no one in Congress can get anything done unless he judges it politically expedient.  Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said Monday that congressional action on gun control sits "literally in the hands" of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell after two mass shootings in the US have left at least 31 dead. "This is, actually, literally in the hands of one person in terms of this legislative action, and it's Mitch McConnell," Harris told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room." "And I would hope and pray that he understands that he actually has the power to do the right thing here and that he will do the right thing. But it doesn't sound like he's prepared to do that."
