 Republican lawmakers have finally unveiled a plan to repeal major portions of Obamacare, capping years of attacks against the health care law and a months-long debate that exposed deep rifts within the GOP. Now comes the hard part. House Republican leaders must begin in earnest the tough task of selling the new plan to overhaul America's health care system to colleagues in both chambers on Capitol Hill, where there is a myriad of clashing interests. And they will have to convince a skeptical public it's worthwhile, just seven years after Congress passed the Affordable Care Act.  Republican leadership's first effort to sell an Obamacare replacement plan has given rise to an unusual consensus in Washington. Officials on both sides of the aisle -- including disparate factions within parties -- and influential outside groups seem to be in agreement: the bill in its current form will never make it to the White House. President Donald Trump on Tuesday nodded to the long road ahead. "Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation," he tweeted, while also calling Obamacare "a complete and total disaster."  The second-ranking Republican Senate leader says a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare is not expected to go to the the chamber's committees of jurisdiction for their imprint, although it will be open to amendment on the floor. Speaking to reporters in the Capitol, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said there has already been a great deal of House and Senate negotiating and he considers the GOP-introduced bill Monday a product of the House and Senate. "Probably straight to the floor," Cornyn said when asked by CNN about the process. "Because there has already been a lot of consultations on a bicameral basis to get us here."
