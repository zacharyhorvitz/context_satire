In September 2006, ABC News reported that several Hershey chocolate products were reformulated to replace cocoa butter with vegetable oil as an emulsifier. According to the company, this change was made to reduce the costs of producing the products instead of raising their prices or decreasing the sizes. Some consumers complained that the taste was different, but the company stated that in the company-sponsored blind taste tests, about half of consumers preferred the new versions. As the new versions no longer met the Food and Drug Administration's official definition of "milk chocolate", the changed items were relabeled from stating they were "milk chocolate" and "made with chocolate" to "chocolate candy" and "chocolatey." Hershey representatives have been responding to the group's messages. At first, customer service told consumers that it was deliberate so the pieces did not fall off after production, but now, they say the company is looking into the cause. In a statement, Jeff Beckman, a Hershey spokesman, said, "We love our Kisses as much as our consumers. We make more than 70 million Kisses a day here in Hershey, PA, and we want each of them looking as great as they taste. This is a list of products manufactured by The Hershey Company. Some of these products began production over 100 years ago such as the Hershey Kiss and Hershey Bar. Hershey produces a variety of products that are chocolate or candy based, and The Hershey Company also produces gum. This list excludes licensed items such as ice cream and chocolate milk, which are made by Breyers, Good Humor, Klondike, and Natrel.
