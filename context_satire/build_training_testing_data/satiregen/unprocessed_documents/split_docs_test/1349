 Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry told CNN Thursday he will support Donald Trump as the Republican presidential nominee and will do everything he can do to help him get elected. Perry, speaking by phone from his hometown of Roundtop, Texas, acknowledged Trump is not his ideal choice. When Perry was a candidate for president earlier in the 2016 cycle, he was the first to come out and criticize Trump and question his conservative credentials, calling his candidacy a "cancer on conservatism."  As his meeting with Republican leaders demonstrated Thursday, Donald Trump is entering a new phase in his quest for the presidency -- one that makes different demands of him as a leader and is perhaps less suited to his natural strengths. The first phase tested him as a brawler, and he was stunningly effective. Whether you like or dislike Trump, you have to hand it to him that he took on 16 other candidates, some far more experienced in politics, and personally knocked most of them out of the ring. He more than proved he can be destructive.  Donald Trump sat down with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a group of GOP Senate leaders in Washington on Thursday -- meetings that included Ohio's Rob Portman, Alabama's Jeff Sessions, and South Dakota's John Thune -- all of whom have been mentioned as potential Trump running mates. A two-term senator from Ohio, Portman is seen as a broadly acceptable figure who would bring legislative experience to a potential ticket. He is also popular in a crucial battleground state, which will be key in November but where Trump lost to John Kasich in the primary. Portman, however, has been adamant in his lack of interest in the vice presidential nomination.
