She also appeared as a leader of Al-Anon in a 1970s informational film called Slight Drinking Problem, in which Patty Duke played the enabling and eventually self-empowered wife of an alcoholic. In feature films, she appeared in The Rotten Apple (1961) and Walk the Angry Beach (1968). She appeared as Ruth Rempley, the wife of a swinger couple in an episode of All In The Family in 1972. She appeared in the Walter Matthau-Jack Lemmon comedy Out to Sea (1997).  Donald Trump's plan to temporarily halt the immigration of Muslims to the U.S. is being met with a mini-wave of mayoral backlash. "If I had the power, the only banning that would be done is that I would ban  from Philadelphia," said that city's mayor, Democrat Michael Nutter, on Tuesday. "We don't have any room for that kind of stupidity here." Hours earlier, another Pennsylvania mayor (and longshot Senate candidate), Braddock's outspoken John Fetterman, released a statement calling Trump a "jagoff," a western Pennsylvania slang expression that means stupid. Her role as Caroline Johnson on the TV show Another World (from July 1970 to September 1971) brought her notice. On the show, while taking care of twins Michael and Marianne Randolph, Caroline fell in love with their father, John, and began poisoning their mother, Pat. The short-term role was extended to more than a year before Caroline was finally brought to justice after kidnapping the twins. Once her role on Another World ended, McClanahan joined the cast of the CBS soap opera Where the Heart Is, in which she played Margaret Jardin.
