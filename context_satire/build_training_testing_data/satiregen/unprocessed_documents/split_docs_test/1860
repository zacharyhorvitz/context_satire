Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sent an invitation to President Donald Trump on January 3, 2019, to deliver a "State of the Union address before a Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday, January 29, 2019 in the House Chamber." The invitation was sent just hours after her election to Speaker of the House. On January 6, President Trump commented to reporters that "I will be making the State of the Union on January 29. And I look forward to it.  A typo on some of the tickets issued for President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address to Congress Tuesday provided invitees a welcome to the "State of the Uniom." The tickets, which are issued by the Office of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper, are provided for spouses and guests of members of Congress and give access to seats in the gallery. While it is unclear how many of the tickets printed had typos, all affected tickets have been reprinted and are in the process of being redistributed, a source in the Sergeant at Arms office said. A second source familiar with the situation confirmed the tickets were being reprinted and being redistributed.  The best part of any speech is seeing how an audience reacts to it. It's no different in the case of the State of the Union address. While CNN was broadcasting the switched feed, we watched the camera that was focused on getting cutaways of the audience (so you didn't have to). Seriously, it was probably an hour before I even knew what color tie President Donald Trump was wearing (blue!).
