He has contributed sporting and general commentary to The Daily Telegraph, and for some time had a sports column on Thursdays and a more general column on Saturdays, but he ceased to regularly contribute to the Telegraph in April 2008. He has continued to contribute occasionally to the other papers he previously worked for, as well as The Wisden Cricketer and The Spectator. In 2015, Henderson appeared in Everest, with Jake Gyllenhaal. In June that year Deadline reported that he would join Grey's Anatomy starting in November, as a potential love interest for series lead Ellen Pompeo's Meredith Grey. The actor exited two years later, his final appearance in October 2017. Henderson told Deadline that his departure was a storytelling-based decision, adding, "This  my final year so I was expecting Nathanâ€™s storyline to be wrapped up." He was also in the running for the part of David Copperfield in George Cukor's film of the same name, but his father insisted that he decline the part and return to Britain, because he felt Hollywood was not the place for a young boy. Henderson Jr. toured in music halls and appeared in several films with his famous father.
