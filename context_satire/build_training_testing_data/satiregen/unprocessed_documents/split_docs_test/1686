In 2017, the scope of the institute was made to be wider and the name of the institute was changed to Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology. In 2018, IIFPT has celebrated it's golden jubilee year, with various events including International Conference on Recent Advances in Food Processing Technology (iCRAFPT'18), etc. As food technology grew from the individual family farm to the factory level, including the slaughterhouse for meat and poultry processing, the cannery for canned foods, and bakeries for bread, the need to have personnel trained for the food industry did also. Literature such as Upton Sinclair's The Jungle in 1906 about slaughterhouse operations would be a factor in the establishment of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later that year. The United States Department of Agriculture was also interested in food technology, and research was already being done at agricultural colleges in the United States, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, and the University of California, Berkeley. By 1935, two MIT professors, Samuel C. Prescott and Bernard E. Proctor decided that it was time to hold an international conference regarding this.  In some ways, it has been a pretty tough year for America -- and a year for tough Americans. The year started in the shadow of the Sandy Hook school shooting. Then, the Boston Marathon bombing brought the country to a standstill, followed by a spate of natural disasters and leading into a summer wracked with unsettling details about government spying. But sometimes the lowest moments can bring out the best in Americans.
