The Veterans Memorial Medical Center (formerly known as Veterans Memorial Hospital) was established in 1955 with full US Government assistance under the US Veterans Administration to provide quality hospitalization, medical care and treatment to Filipino veterans as provided by U.S. public law. The patients were originally those who suffer from service-connected disabilities arising from their services with the USAFFE, recognized guerrilla units, Philippine Scouts, and Philippine Commonwealth Army, which was later extended to AFP retirees and their dependents. Local residents started to raise funds for the hospital in 1921, and opened on November 2, 1925 as Sarasota Hospital on November 2, 1925 with a capacity of 32-beds and usage of simple canvas tents. In 1927, the facility was turned over to the city of Sarasota and was renamed Sarasota Municipal Hospital. By the 1930s, the hospital had a capacity of 100 beds, an ambulance garage, nurse's home and a wing for patient overflow. The hospital continued to expand in the 1940s, with a surgical suite, kitchen and dining room and an air conditioned unit.
