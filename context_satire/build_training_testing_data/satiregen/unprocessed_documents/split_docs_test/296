 On the day that President Donald Trump announced the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the parents of Kayla Mueller, who was kidnapped and reportedly raped by the ISIS leader, say they are feeling a "roller coaster of emotions." "Well, it's a roller coaster of emotions whenever this ugly situation raises its head, but it's become part of our life over the last five and a half years," Kayla's father Carl Mueller told CNN in a phone interview Sunday afternoon. In 2012, Kayla traveled to the Turkey/Syria border to work with the Danish Refugee Council and the humanitarian organization Support to Life, which assisted families forced to flee their homes. She was taken hostage by ISIS in Aleppo, Syria, in 2013 after she visited a Spanish MSF (Doctors Without Borders) hospital.  President Donald Trump asserted in his televised address from the White House Sunday that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was "whimpering and crying " before ultimately detonating his suicide vest in a tunnel as US commandos closed in. Trump painted the ISIS leader as a coward, describing in great detail how he "spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him." "He died like a dog. ...The world is now a much safer place," he added.  There are good dogs -- and then there are hero dogs who chase down the world's top terrorist to his fatal demise. President Donald Trump said that a dog, part of the US operation that resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi over the weekend, was injured while chasing Baghdadi down a dead-end tunnel. Trump declassified a photo of the dog on Monday afternoon, tweeting, "We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi!" The dog is believed to have been sent down the tunnel after it was feared that Baghdadi was wearing a suicide vest.
