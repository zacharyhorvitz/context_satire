The story focuses on a family of 'anthropomorphic' rabbits. The widowed mother rabbit warns her four rabbit children, Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter not to enter the vegetable garden of a man named Mr. McGregor, whose wife, she tells them, put their father in a pie after he entered. Her triplets (Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail) obediently refrain from entering the garden, but Peter enters the garden to snack on some vegetables. Peter ends up eating more than what is good for him and goes looking for parsley to cure his stomach ache. Guy (voiced by LaKeith Stanfield) is a bison cameraman for Girl Croosh. He travels with Diane throughout the country filming exposés, and the two soon begin dating. He asks Diane to stay with him at his home in Chicago; and though Diane initially declines, she later changes her mind and moves in with him. He remains supportive of Diane and her attempt to write her own book of essays. The day after Linkletter’s death, Art Linkletter held a press conference where he stated that his daughter’s death "wasn't a suicide. She was not herself. She was murdered by the people who manufacture and distribute LSD." He also stated that Linkletter had used LSD in the six months prior to her death and the two discussed a "bum trip" she had experienced.
