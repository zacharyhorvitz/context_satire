 The field of Democratic presidential hopefuls faced off in their first debate, hosted by CNN and Facebook, on Tuesday night. For more than two hours, the candidates tried to make their best impressions before a national audience discovering many of them for the first time. Here's how they did: Winner Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton proved without a doubt Tuesday night why she is the Democratic Party's presidential front-runner. Clinton remained unflappable throughout the debate, showcasing her political experience and her command of the issues -- all the while deftly handling criticism of her flip-flops and displaying a humor that put a more human face to her oft-criticized candidacy.  It was a victorious comeback for Hillary Clinton, a front-runner who has been on the downswing. The former secretary of state and first lady, who once came within a few cracks of shattering the glass ceiling to win a major party's presidential nomination, stepped on to a debate stage once more Tuesday night. But this time, it was to ask the American people to allow her to succeed the very man who had crushed her White House dreams seven years ago. In the first Democratic debate of the 2016 cycle hosted by CNN and Facebook in Las Vegas, Clinton faced off against four others trying to make the same case.  Hillary Clinton has one job in the upcoming CNN Democratic debate:  She needs to convince Democrats that we don't need Joe Biden to enter the race to keep the White House. So, whether or not he shows up in Las Vegas on October 13, (CNN rules allow him to enter as late as the day of the debate), his presence will loom large. Will Clinton be able to get the job done? It's a tall and complicated order for just two hours.
