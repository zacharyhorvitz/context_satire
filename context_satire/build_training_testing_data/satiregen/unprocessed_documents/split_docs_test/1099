A moon pie, stylized as MoonPie, is an American confection, popular across much of the United States, which consists of two round graham cookies, with marshmallow filling in the center, dipped in a flavored coating. The snack is often associated with the cuisine of the American South, where they are traditionally accompanied by an RC Cola. Today, Moonpies are made by Chattanooga Bakery, Inc. in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The traditional pie is approximately 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter. A s'more is a campfire treat popular in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, consisting of a marshmallow and a layer of chocolate placed between two pieces of graham cracker or cookie. A choco pie is a snack cake consisting of two small round layers of cake with marshmallow filling and a chocolate covering. The term originated in America but is now also used widely in South Korea, Japan, and its exports, and many other countries as either a brand name or a generic term. Names for similar confections in other places include chocolate marshmallow pie, Wagon Wheels, angel pie, Jos Louis, and moon pie.
