John Dawson Shea was born in New York City to James Shea, an Irish immigrant and school principal, and Mary Ann (Flannigan) Shea. His early studies were at the grammar school of Columbia College, where his father was principal. At an early age he became a clerk in a Spanish merchant's office, where he learned to read and write Spanish fluently. Shea graduated from St. John's College (now Fordham University), and entered the Society of Jesus in 1844; during this time he added his middle name of Gilmary ("servant of Mary"). Shea was murdered on August 26, 1969. Manson had decided to have Shea killed because he believed Shea had reported them to the police, resulting in a raid on the ranch on August 16 where the family were taken into custody on suspicion of car theft. Family member Bruce Davis claimed that the decision to kill Shea came from Manson because he considered him to be a "snitch". Manson told Davis, Tex Watson, and Steve Grogan to ask for a ride to a nearby car parts yard on the ranch. On December 19, Shea was accused of domestic terrorism in a report released by the Washington State House of Representatives. House leadership forwarded the report to the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington and the FBI. Sheriff Knezovich stated that he believed there was enough evidence "to charge Shea with domestic terrorism, if not treason." The sheriff also stated that he was worried that arresting Shea would lead to an armed standoff, and that he had contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding this concern.
