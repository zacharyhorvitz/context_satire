 The story of the Jews in the United States is a testament to "American exceptionalism" and stands in contrast to a long history of discrimination and pariah status in Europe and Muslim lands. In fact, the economic prosperity and social standing of America's Jews shows that generally they have fared better than many other minorities. This positive record is a fulfillment of the assurance given to the Newport, Rhode Island, Hebrew Congregation in 1790 by President George Washington: "It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it were the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights, for, happily, the Government of the United States ... gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance." Since then, American Jews have been appointed and elected to public offices as governors, senators, mayors, Cabinet officers and in the military, and today, most American adults are unaware of and don't seem to care who's Jewish. In 1981, the population of African Americans at Princeton University made up less than 10%. Bruce M. Wright was admitted into the university in 1936 as the first African American, however, his admission was a mistake and when he got to campus he was asked to leave. Three years later Wright asked the dean for an explanation on his dismissal and the dean suggested to him that "a member of your race might feel very much alone" at Princeton University.  The battle over the confirmation of Loretta Lynch heated up Wednesday as a top Senate Democrat accused Republican leadership of treating the would-be first African-American woman attorney general like a second-class citizen. The charge was a response to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's vow to delay a vote on Lynch until the Senate completes consideration of an unrelated bill to fight human trafficking -- legislation that had broad bipartisan support until Democrats discovered it contained an anti-abortion provision. READ: Standoff over AG nominee Loretta Lynch Democrats like Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin argue Lynch's nomination has nothing to do with the trafficking bill and are demanding an immediate vote. "The Republican Majority Leader announced over the weekend that he was going to hold this nomination of Loretta Lynch until the bill, which is pending before the Senate passes, whenever that may be," Durbin said on the Senate floor.
