Jake tracks Nick down to a yoga studio, where Nick is enthusiastic to see Noelle yet cannot make himself return north and become Santa. After a heated argument, Noelle leaves the building. She returns to the mall, where her reindeer friend Snowcone arrives with a letter from Mrs. Claus informing her about the situation back home and ordering her to find and bring Nick back home. During Noelle's time away, Gabriel had used an algorithm to determine that there were only 2,837 "nice" children in the world, much to the horror of the elves and Mrs. Claus. After a visit from Polly, who reveals her identity as an elf, Jake removes Noelle from the hospital and she makes her way back to the North Pole with Nick, Polly, and the reindeer before Christmas Eve. Back home, after a meeting with the elders, Nick nominates Noelle as the next Santa, which stirs up controversy throughout the town but unanimously gains agreement from the elders as she naturally has the skills and there is no rule against a female Santa. Noelle successfully delivers the presents across the world, as well as dropping Jake off at his ex-wife's house to spend time with Alex. The next morning, Gabe happily returns to tech support and Nick establishes a yoga studio in the North Pole. On RogerEbert.com, Nick Allen gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, saying, "It's yet another instance in which it's hard to not think about what could have been, especially since the original did it so much better."
