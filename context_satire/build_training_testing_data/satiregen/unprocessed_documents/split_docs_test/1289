The marriage is soon tested by Jimmi's desire to start a family and Cherry's affair with Daniel Granger (Matthew Chambers), which he threatens to reveal. A month later, Abelson departed the cast to pursue new roles. On-screen Cherry and Jimmi's marriage "implodes", as Jimmi discovers the affair. He initially "holds it together", but he loses his temper when he learns that Cherry has secretly been taking contraception, despite their plans for a family. By the end of 2006, PNAC was "reduced to a voice-mail box and a ghostly website  single employee ... left to wrap things up", according to a correspondent at the BBC News. In 2006 former executive director of the PNAC Gary Schmitt said PNAC had never been intended to "go on forever," and had "already done its job," suggesting that "our view has been adopted." In 2009 Robert Kagan and William Kristol created a new think tank, the Foreign Policy Initiative, which scholars Stephen M. Walt and Don Abelson have characterized as a successor to PNAC. From September 5, 2018, till January 13, 2019, the PNAC homepage went back online without any further explanation. Towards the end of 2019, the character was the focus of a major storyline that saw him arrested for heroin possession. Following a shift as forensic medical examiner, Jimmi is approached by the Major Crime Squad who ask to search his car. They find a large amount of heroin and take him into the station for questioning. A show spokesperson told Allison Jones of Inside Soap that Jimmi is left "speechless" by the discovery, as it is the last thing he was expecting them to find.
