The Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan held a garden party at Government House on Canada Day and, in the Northwest Territories, the Canada Day parade was themed to celebrate the jubilee and numerous jubilee medal presentation ceremonies took place. Also on 1 July, the Canadian Museum of Civilization opened the exhibit A Queen and Her Country, showing artefacts from the Crown Collection relating to Queen Elizabeth II and her role as Queen of Canada, including the Queen's Beasts from her coronation. At Rideau Hall on 11 September, a reception, attended by the Governor General; his wife; Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex; Sophie, Countess of Wessex; and others, was held for the Royal Victorian Order Association of Canada and to "honour of the 60th anniversary of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth IIâ€™s accession to the Throne." The Earl also distributed Diamond Jubilee Medals to recipients in Toronto and to members of the RCMP in Iqaluit, Nunavut.  Members of the royal family, UK government and dignitaries gathered Tuesday in Westminster Abbey for a service to mark the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation. The queen was accompanied to the service by her husband, Prince Philip, as well as her son Prince Charles and her grandchildren, among them Princes William and Harry. William's pregnant wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, was also present. She is expecting their first child in July, just over two years after they were married at the abbey. Members of the Middleton family have been related to the British royal family by marriage since the wedding of Catherine Middleton and Prince William in April 2011, when she became the Duchess of Cambridge.
