 As the presidential candidates head into their final day of campaigning, both President Obama and Mitt Romney are focusing on the biggest prizes: the elusive swing states. CNN currently lists Pennsylvania as likely to "lean Obama," but both campaigns are fighting for the Keystone state. Just one day after Mitt Romney took the stage in Pennsylvania, President Obama is deploying Bill Clinton to the state for four campaign states. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), who campaigned with both Romney and Paul Ryan this weekend, weighs in on the final push for his state on "Starting Point" today.  The frenetic pace of presidential campaigning that has crested in the last few days -- in which the candidates or their surrogates hit 10 states -- won't end when voters go to the polls on Tuesday. Republican candidate Mitt Romney will campaign in two states on Election Day - Ohio and Pennsylvania - according to a Romney campaign official. Campaigning on Election Day, a senior Romney adviser says, will help "keep the energy going" until the polls close. The idea is that the campaign is "just going to keep working up until the polls close," said the same Romney adviser.  President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney barnstormed their way across more than a half-dozen battleground states on Sunday, making closing arguments to a closely divided American electorate before Tuesday's vote. Obama stumped in New Hampshire in the morning, flew to Florida and Ohio, and was headed west to Colorado in the evening. Romney spent Sunday heading east from Iowa to Virginia, with a stop in Ohio and a foray into Pennsylvania in between. Along the way, Obama painted Tuesday's vote as a choice between policies that had moved the country out of the depths of recession and ones that got it into one in the first place.
