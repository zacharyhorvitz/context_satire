When Pete Campbell blackmails Don, he comes to Rachel with the suggestion that they run away together to Los Angeles. She reminds him of his duty to his children and questions whether he would want to abandon his children after having grown up without a father. When Don persists, Rachel comes to the realization that he does not want to run away with her; he just wants to run away. She calls him a coward. Caroline (Beth Hall) is Roger Sterling's longtime secretary, first appearing in Season 4's "Christmas Comes But Once a Year". She is very well liked by nearly everyone at SCDP and is extremely loyal to Roger, being apparently close enough to him that she is able to speak her mind to him when she feels he is out of line. She is also close to Roger's family, becoming very upset when she learns of Roger's mother's passing. Of the secretaries at SCDP, she seems to be the one closest to Joan. Rachel Katz (n√©e Menken; Maggie Siff) is the Jewish head of a department store who becomes romantically involved with Draper after she comes to Sterling Cooper in search of an advertising agency to revamp her business' image. Don's first encounter with Rachel, in the pilot, is at a meeting where he pitches the idea of using coupons to attract more customers to the store. Rachel disagrees with the tactic, asserting that she would like to attract wealthier customers. Draper is unhappy with hearing a woman talk to him assertively at the business table.
