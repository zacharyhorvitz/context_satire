SEC Director General Al-Faki resigned in April 2009 amid criticism of the SEC role in a share-manipulation scandal involving the African Petroleum stock. He was eventually replaced by Arunma Oteh, who became Director General in January 2010. In August 2010 Oteh dismissed Okereke-Onyiuke from the stock exchange. The President of the Stock Exchange, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, was also dismissed. Unlike the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the SESC doesn't have the power to punish those who violate the law or regulations. Instead, it reports its findings to the cabinet, prosecutors, and the Financial Services Agency with recommendations. In addition to which, it has been described as understaffed - as of 2004, the SESC had 444 staff, as compared to 3100 at the US SEC. The total number of SESC staff had increased to 697 as of fiscal year 2010. Members of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are appointed by the President of the United States. As of 2011, their terms last five years and are staggered so that one commissioner's term ends on June 5 of each year. If an appointment is to fill out an uncompleted term, it will be for less than five years. To ensure that the commission remains non-partisan, no more than three commissioners may belong to the same political party.
