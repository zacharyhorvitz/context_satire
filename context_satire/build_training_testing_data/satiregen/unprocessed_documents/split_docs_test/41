 Donald Trump announced Thursday that he's forgiving the millions he's loaned to his own campaign, calling it a contribution "made in order to 'Make America Great Again.'" In a written statement, the presumptive GOP nominee said he would not be requiring the campaign to pay him back. The total loan amounted to $46.1 million by the end of May 31, according to the most recent financial records available. The announcement comes in a week dominated by headlines about his lagging fundraising numbers behind those of Hillary Clinton. According to Bloomberg News, Trump's general election campaign raised over $500 million, roughly half the sum raised by the Clinton campaign. By October 19, Trump had "put $56.2 million of his own  into the campaign, leaving him with scant time to put in the rest of the $100 million he's pledged to spend."  Donald Trump sought to reassure jittery donors at a private fundraiser in New York City Tuesday night, in part by vowing to spend whatever it takes of his own fortune to win the White House. The high-dollar event at Le Cirque restaurant in midtown Manhattan came at a moment of turmoil for Trump, as the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has battled weeks of unflattering headlines and devastating fundraising numbers released Monday. Trump used the gathering Tuesday to remind supporters and top GOP donors that he had repeatedly defied expectations throughout the primary season and expressed confidence that he will once against outperform his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, two individuals present at the fundraiser told CNN on the condition of anonymity. Trump said he took pride in having won the Republican primary on a shoestring budget and minimal staff, as he contrasted his primary resources to Clinton's robust operation.
