Bradbury's lifelong passion for books began at an early age. After graduating from high school, Bradbury's family could not afford for him to attend college so Bradbury began spending time at the Los Angeles Public Library where he essentially educated himself. As a frequent visitor to his local libraries in the 1920s and 1930s, he recalls being disappointed because they did not stock popular science fiction novels, like those of H. G. Wells, because, at the time, they were not deemed literary enough. Between this and learning about the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, a great impression was made on the young man about the vulnerability of books to censure and destruction. Bradbury described himself as "a preventor of futures, not a predictor of them." He did not believe that book burning was an inevitable part of the future; he wanted to warn against its development. In a later interview, when asked if he believes that teaching Fahrenheit 451 in schools will prevent his totalitarian vision of the future, Bradbury replied in the negative. Rather, he states that education must be at the kindergarten and first-grade level. Bradbury was among the early supporters of the Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF), founded in 1882 to support British excavations in Egypt. Her friend, the journalist and traveller Amelia Edwards, was a founder member of the EEF, and in 1890 Bradbury accompanied her on a lecture tour of America, where Edwards was promoting and fundraising for the EEF. She was a Committee member and one of the Fund's local secretaries, helping to gather subscriptions in Britain on the Fund's behalf.
