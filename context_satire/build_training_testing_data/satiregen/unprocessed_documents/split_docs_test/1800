Swan was educated at Castleknock College and worked as a cardiologist in the Mayo Clinic (in Rochester, Minnesota), and later moved to Cedars Sinai Hospital (Los Angeles). His description of the invention of the catheter is said to have derived from watching the wind playing with sails in Santa Monica. He was present at the Mayo around the time they were performing early open heart surgeries in the mid-1950s. He died from complications following a heart attack following a long period of debilitation from a stroke. In 1963, the hospital created a medical school, and in 1968 it welcomed the first students of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, now the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The 1980s had a $500 million hospital expansion, including the construction of the Guggenheim Pavilion, the first medical facility designed by I.M. Pei. Its faculty has made significant contributions to gene therapy, cardiology, immunotherapy, organ transplants, cancer treatments, and minimally invasive surgery. The issue of human resources management between nurses and doctors at Mount Sinai hospital was reported by Jose Martinez on April 20, 2010 in the New York Daily News. As stated by Martinez: "A Catholic nurse was forced to assist in an abortion at Mount Sinai Medical Center over her strenuous objections, a lawsuit filed Friday charges. Catherina Cenzon-DeCarlo, who works in the operating room at the Manhattan hospital, contends that her boss ordered her to assist in the May 2009 abortion of a 22-week-old fetus or face charges of 'insubordination and patient abandonment.'"
