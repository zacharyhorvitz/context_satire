In 2016, both the Democratic and Republican conventions were held before the Summer Olympics instead of after, as was the case in 2008 and 2012. One reason the Republican Party scheduled their convention in July was to help avoid a longer, drawn-out primary battle similar to what happened in 2012, which left the party fractured heading into the general election and eventually led to Mitt Romney losing the election to Barack Obama. The Democratic Party then followed suit, scheduling their convention in Philadelphia the week after the Republicans' convention, to provide a quicker response. On May 3, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus declared Donald Trump the presumptive nominee after Texas senator Ted Cruz dropped out of the race.  In Tampa this week, it's not just Republicans in town for the convention. Over the next few days, you'll see a lot of Democratic faces in Florida, dogging and counter-pointing the GOP's every move. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, national co-chair for the Obama Campaign and chairmain for the Democratic National Convention next week in Charlotte, is one of those Democratic voices in Tampa. He says his presence at the RNC is to remind voters what Republicans said during the primary season.  Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is behind enemy lines tonight. The co-chair of the Obama Campaign and chairman of the Democratic National Convention is on hand at the Republican National Convention to rebut the message from the GOP. He talks with John Berman about his role at the convention in the midst of Tropical Storm Isaac. Villaraigosa says he’s in Tampa to challenge the Republican platform “in a way that is respectful of the other party.”  “We’re to compare and contrast, but we’re also here together, working together, to make sure that people are safe," he says.
