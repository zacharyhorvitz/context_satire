On June 21, 2011, Kelly announced his retirement from the U.S. Navy and NASA, effective October 1, 2011. His retirement was announced on his Facebook page, where he wrote, "Words cannot convey my deep gratitude for the opportunities I have been given to serve our great nation. From the day I entered the United States Merchant Marine Academy in the summer of 1982 to the moment I landed the Space Shuttle Endeavour three weeks ago, it has been my privilege to advance the ideals that define the United States of America."  Former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly's "next mission" is to be a US senator for Arizona. "I care about people. I care about the state of Arizona. I care about this nation.  When former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly announced his bid for the US Senate on Tuesday, he did what an increasing number of Democratic candidates have done recently: He swore off donations from corporate PACs. "This campaign is about the people of Arizona, not corporate PACs and the mess they've created in Washington," Kelly wrote on his campaign website. "I won't take a dime of corporate PAC money." But Kelly and his wife, former Arizona congresswoman and shooting survivor Gabby Giffords, actually run a political action committee of their own, and it spent more than $6.4 million in last year's midterms to help candidates who back their mission of preventing gun violence.
