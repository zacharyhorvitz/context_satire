The Eurogamer review noted that initially the choices faced by a player can be bewildering. Although there are tutorials, gameplay was far from intuitive. Eurogamer also thought the graphics were beautiful and that after a while the element of surprise tactics was missing. A GamesRadar review described it as a fleet-management game and felt it was suited for players that liked to tinker. After marrying the children's book illustrator John Burningham in 1964, she turned to illustrating childrenâ€™s books herself. In 1980, she created a series of books about a mischievous young boy called Tom, and his stuffed monkey, Pippo. She commented that Tom was very much like her own son in his younger years. Like Tom, her son would often blame his misdeeds on an accomplice (the family dog). The series told the adventures of a parentless family of rowdy brothers trying to run the family ranch in northern California. Into the chaos came feisty Hannah, who married Adam and took on the task of bringing order to the household. The series contained about one musical number per episode, written by notable songwriter Jimmy Webb. Despite a small but dedicated fan following, the series was cancelled after one season.
