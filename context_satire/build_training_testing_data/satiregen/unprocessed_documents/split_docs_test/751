 Tariffs on imported autos would be intended to protect the US economy, but they'll probably do more harm than good. Automakers will lose sales. And car buyers will probably end up paying higher prices on a smaller selection of vehicles. President Trump argues that tariffs will create more auto jobs at US plants.  President Donald Trump sarcastically congratulated America Thursday on the one-year anniversary of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, maintaining that there was no collusion between his campaign and the Russians. "Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction," Trump tweeted. "The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money!" In a second tweet Thursday morning, Trump suggested there was an FBI informant embedded within his campaign.  House Speaker Paul Ryan made the case Thursday for Catholicism as a faith that can help solve the country's problems. Ryan, who is Catholic, lamented at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast what he sees as a deepening sense of "identity politics and tribalism" in the country, as well as a trend of "moral relativism" that is becoming "more and more pervasive." "If there was ever a time, if there was ever a place where Catholics — from the clergy to the laity — are needed, it is here and it is now, helping solve this problem, addressing this challenge," he said. "Our social doctrine is the perfect antidote to what ails our culture."
