Beginning in 1936, the railway line that the depot serviced was the route for the famed Twin Cities 400. Railway operations ceased at the depot in 1963. Currently, it houses the Reedsburg Chamber of Commerce and the headquarters for the 400 Trail. The railway line, however, remains in use by Wisconsin and Southern Railroad. The landmark Waunakee Railroad Depot located in the central part of town is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It now houses the Waunakee Area Chamber of Commerce offices. Susie the Duck has been the town's official mascot since 1948. On Wisconsin Highway 113 in downtown Lodi is a small creek-side park where visitors can buy dried corn from vending machines to feed the wild ducks. In this area is a small stone basket, inscribed with the name of former Lodi resident Engle Knerzer, and every year a duck builds a nest there. When the first mallard settled in that location in 1948, it was nicknamed "Susie" by the granddaughter of the police chief.
