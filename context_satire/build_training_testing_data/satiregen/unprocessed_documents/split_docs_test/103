In the 1980s Jenkins met with Juan Javier Macklis, who owned a pharmaceutical plant in Tijuana, Mexico, that was contracted to supply medicines for the Mexican government. Together, Jenkins and Macklis produced anabolic steroids; Jenkins then smuggled the drugs into the United States, which is a felony. In April 1987 Jenkins was arrested and pleaded guilty in December of that year for the trafficking of steroids worth around $100 million which was caught at the Tijuana border. It was reported that at one time Jenkins was responsible for up to 70% of the steroids trafficked in the United States. According to The Wall Street Journal, thanks to "elaborate structure and cash flows", both Barclays and Wachovia were able to take credit for a full payment of the tax, meaning the $94 million could be claimed twice (a so-called "double dip"). The report suggested that Augustus Funding was one of at least nine structures involving US banks set up by Jenkins and his team. Barclays called the account of the transactions "materially inaccurate", while a statement from Wachovia said that they had "complied with all applicable laws and regulations". In 2009, The Guardian reported tales of a macho culture inside the Structured Capital Markets division, where, one source claimed, "the deals are so big you never say billion or million, you just say 16 bucks or 16 quid which meant billion". The same source suggested that tax avoidance "was so big it became the engine of growth for the whole of the investment banking arm". Some calculations had estimated that in 2002 Jenkins and his team generated revenues amounting to more than 100 per cent of Barclays Capital's profits, figures Barclays said were "gross exaggerations", adding that Jenkins was in charge of four businesses – tax-efficient financing being only one – and that those businesses generated less than 20 per cent of the bank's revenues.
