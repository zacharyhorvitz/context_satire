Four forensic facial reconstructions of the decedent have since been created; each varying strongly from the others. It was reported that a man convicted of the murder of a woman native to Ohio in Tennessee, who was a trucker, may have been involved. At his house, authorities discovered shoes and underwear, two types of clothing that the Frederick County Jane Doe was not wearing. On August 8, 1989, a blue suitcase containing the skeleton of a toddler was discovered near the Barren River Lake, Glasgow, Barren County, Kentucky. The victim was estimated to have been between two and three years old and its sex was not possible to determine, though some believe that the child was female. The victim, who may have been biracial, had been deceased for one to six months and the case was ruled as a homicide. After it was made public that the body was found, a person who was apparently an attorney requested to police that their client, a woman, would not be charged if she submitted information that she knew about the child. As Somerset and Mills return to the police station, Doe turns himself in, covered in the blood of an unidentified victim. Doe offers to take the detectives to the final two victims and confess to the murders, but only under specific terms, or he will plead insanity. Somerset is wary, but Mills agrees.
