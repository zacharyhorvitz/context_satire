The vermin only teaze and pinchTheir foes superior by an inch. So nat'ralists observe, a fleaHath smaller fleas that on him prey;And these have smaller fleas to bite 'em. And so proceeds ad infinitum. Thus every poet, in his kind,Is bit by him that comes behind: People have known about parasites such as roundworms and tapeworms since ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. In Early Modern times, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek observed Giardia lamblia in his microscope in 1681, while Francesco Redi described internal and external parasites including sheep liver fluke and ticks. Modern parasitology developed in the 19th century. In human culture, parasitism has negative connotations. In the classical era, the concept of the parasite was not strictly pejorative: the parasitus was an accepted role in Roman society, in which a person could live off the hospitality of others, in return for "flattery, simple services, and a willingness to endure humiliation".
