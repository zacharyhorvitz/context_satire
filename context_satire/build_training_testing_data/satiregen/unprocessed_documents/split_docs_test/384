On April 8, 2013, Johnson was fired from J. C. Penney after 17 months with the company. Mike Ullman, the retailer's former CEO, was announced as his replacement shortly afterwardsâ€”the official statement claimed that Ullman was "well-positioned to quickly analyze the situation J. C. Penney faces and take steps to improve the company's performance." During his time at Home Depot, Ellison helped oversee the chain's turnaround. As CEO of J.C. Penney, Ellison helped the company make progress in recovering lost profitability and laid out a three-year plan, starting in 2017, for growing sales. But he admitted that he had failed to increase the value of the company's stock for its stockholders, which by his own statement is the primary responsibility of a CEO. On September 26, 2013, J. C. Penney, with Goldman Sachs as the sole underwriter, announced plans to issue 84 million shares of its stock. The move stood in contrast with CEO Mike Ullman's remarks from earlier that day, whereby he did not foresee "conditions for the rest of the year that would warrant raising liquidity."
