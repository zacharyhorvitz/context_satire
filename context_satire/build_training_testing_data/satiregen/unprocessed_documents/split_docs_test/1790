 The French government has backed down over apparent plans to pay tribute to Marshal Philippe Pétain -- who collaborated with the Nazis in the deportation of Jews from France during World War II -- as part of commemorations to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. French President Emmanuel Macron came under fire Wednesday after he said it was "legitimate" to honor Pétain's role as a "great soldier" in World War I. Hours later, French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said in a Facebook post that no tribute would be paid to Pétain in Saturday's ceremony. "We had announced that we would honor the marshals of the Great War. Some have deduced that Pétain was one of them; this is not the case.  Ron Freer is 103 years old. He is blind and uses a wheelchair. Ron lost his sight 75 years ago in the service of his country -- and the Allied Powers, which include Britain, France and the United States -- due to the malnutrition he endured in a Japanese prisoner of war camp during World War II. He spent four years in the camp after the fall of the British military base at Fort Stanley.  Military museums across the United States and around the world often offer visitors glimpses of world wars, commemorating the men and women who sacrificed their lives for their country. The National Veterans Memorial and Museum has a broader goal: to represent veterans -- not just war. War stories are present, of course, but they aren't primary. Instead, there's attention given to the decision to serve, training and boot camp, the sacred oath, deployment and personnel roles, separation from friends and family, survival, sacrifice and homecoming.
