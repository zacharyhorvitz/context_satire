 A court hearing to determine the fate of Prince's estate -- including the contents of a secretive vault the musician left behind at Paisley Park -- concluded Monday with a special administrator appointed but no will discovered. While a search for the late pop icon's will continues, the court appointed St. Paul-based Bremer Trust as special administrator during the proceeding in Chaska, Minnesota, outside Minneapolis. The court determined that all possible heirs have been reached and have been provided the opportunity to be included in the petition filed by Prince's sister, Tyka Nelson, said First Judicial District Judge Kevin Eide. What resides in the vault at Paisley Park is anyone's guess, but Prince's half-brother, Alfred Jackson, told CNN that if it contains music, he wants the world to hear it.  Fans have flocked outside Prince's Paisley Park estate since the singer's recent death at the age of 57. Now there are rumors that Prince's fans will be able to tour Paisley Park at some point. The future of the Chanhassen, Minnesota, complex where the superstar recorded music and threw parties is not entirely certain. But chatter that it could become a museum and tourist attraction like Elvis Presley's Graceland has sparked excitement. Paisley Park Records was an American record label founded by musician Prince in 1985, which was distributed by and funded in part by Warner Bros. Records. It was started in 1985, following the success of the film and album Purple Rain. The label shares its name with Prince's recording complex Paisley Park Studios and the song "Paisley Park" on his 1985 Around the World in a Day album. Paisley Park was opened to the public as a museum and memorial to Prince following his death.
