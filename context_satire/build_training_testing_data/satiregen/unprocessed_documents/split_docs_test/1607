Carl Stotz, George Bebble and Bert Bebble, residents of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, founded Little League Baseball in 1939. They began experimenting with their idea in the summer of 1938 when they gathered Carl's nephews, Jimmy and Major Gehron and their neighborhood friends. They tried different field dimensions over the course of the summer and played several informal games. The following summer they felt that they were ready to establish what later became Little League Baseball. The Twins are a last-place team (in real life they were World Series champions just three years prior), but Billy and his grandfather love each other, the Twins, and the game of baseball. When Thomas dies, his will reveals that he has given the team to Billy. Thomas specifies that, if Billy is still a minor at the time of his death, his aides are to help him until Billy is old enough to run the team by himself.  From rugby league to the NFL to the Olympic Games -- Jarryd Hayne doesn't believe in standing still. The Australian has ended his short dalliance with American football to try to win a place in Fiji's rugby sevens squad for Rio 2016. He played eight games in his only season as a running back with the San Francisco 49ers, but the lure of the Olympics has proved too strong. "I am retiring from the NFL because the Fiji rugby sevens team reached out to me about the opportunity to join the team for the upcoming Olympics, and I simply could not pass that chance up," the 28-year-old dual passport holder said in a statement.
