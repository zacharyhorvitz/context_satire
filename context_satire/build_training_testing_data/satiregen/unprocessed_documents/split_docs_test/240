 As news broke on Monday evening that Donald Trump had, according to reports from the Washington Post and later the New York Times, shared code word (highly classified) intelligence with the Russian Foreign Minister during his visit to the Oval Office last week, the shock wave was felt far beyond the beltway. When Washington wakes up on Tuesday, leaders in Middle Eastern and European capitals -- and elsewhere around the world -- could be hours into re-evaluating their intelligence sharing relationship with the United States. And can you blame them? Two former officials knowledgeable of the situation confirmed to CNN that the main points of the Post story are accurate, and if that is true, Donald Trump didn't just violate intelligence protocols -- he likely put the lives of members of the intelligence community serving an allied country at risk.  President Donald Trump shared highly classified information with the Russian foreign minister and Russian ambassador to the US in a White House meeting last week, The Washington Post first reported Monday. Two former officials knowledgeable of the situation confirmed to CNN that the main points of the Post story are accurate: The President shared classified information with the Russian foreign minister. The President did not directly reveal the source of the information, but intelligence officials told CNN that there is concern that Russia will be able to figure out the highly sensitive source. There is some disagreement, according to one of the sources, as to how far the President went.  The Washington Post published yet another bombshell report about our President Monday. The story, citing unnamed US officials, alleges that Donald Trump gave visiting Russian officials details of intelligence on ISIS and a plot to blow up planes using laptops -- information that had been given to the United States by an ally. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and its ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, were made privy to information so secret that the United States had not shared with its own allies,  according to the news report -- but Trump bragged about it to officials from a hostile government. CNN has not confirmed the Washington Post report or a New York Times report that followed it.
