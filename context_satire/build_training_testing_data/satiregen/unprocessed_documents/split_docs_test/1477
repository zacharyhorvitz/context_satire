 Former President Bill Clinton will reemerge as a surrogate for his wife's presidential campaign next week at a high-dollar fundraiser in Chicago that Hillary Clinton was previously scheduled to attend, a campaign aide told CNN. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, canceled her appearance at the fundraiser to add a day of campaigning in New Hampshire, where Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is surging as he looks to topple Clinton's front-runner status. Bill Clinton has been largely absent from the 2016 campaign trail, but Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign insists the Sept. 17 fundraiser will not be an outlier, instead marking the beginning of the former president's reappearance on the fundraising circuit, the aide said. The aide added the former president would appear at more fundraising events, but declined to provide dates. Before we begin, I just want to take a minute to thank Senator Clinton for the kind and generous support she offered on Saturday  She ran an historic race, a historic campaign that shattered barriers on behalf of my daughters and women everywhere who know now that there are no limits to their dreams. What's more, she inspired millions of women and men with her strength, her courage, and her unyielding commitment to the causes that brought us here today â€“ the hopes and aspirations of working Americans. Our party and our country are stronger because of the work that Hillary Rodham Clinton has done throughout her life, and I look forward to working with her ... to make sure we lay out the case for change and set a new course for this country. On November 12, 2007, the New York Times reported that "At two campaign events in Iowa this year, aides to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton encouraged audience members to ask her specific questions, a tactic that drew criticism from an opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination and led her yesterday to promise that it would not happen again." In response, Clinton remarked, 'It was news to me  and neither I nor my campaign approve of that, and it will certainly not be tolerated.'"
