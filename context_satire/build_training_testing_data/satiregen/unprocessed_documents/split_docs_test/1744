Mone strove to return to employment and obtained a marketing job with the Labatt brewing company. Within two years she had risen to become its head of marketing in Scotland. She was made redundant by Labatt, prompting her to set up her own business. She has since admitted that she exaggerated qualifications on her CV in order to get the job.
