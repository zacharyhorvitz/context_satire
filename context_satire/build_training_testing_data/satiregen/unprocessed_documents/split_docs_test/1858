 Two of the country's largest and most influential religious groups, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National Association of Evangelicals, are urging the United States not to halt the resettlement of Syrian refugees after the deadly terrorist attack in Paris last Friday. "Of course we want to keep terrorists out of our country, but let's not punish the victims of ISIS for the sins of ISIS," Leith Anderson, NAE president, said on Tuesday. House Speaker Paul Ryan has called for a "pause" in the U.S. program accepting Syrian refugees and 30 governors have said they will not welcome them, though they have little legal authority to bar the federal government from settling refugees in their states. Meanwhile, almost every GOP presidential candidate has said the United States should stop admitting Syrian refugees.  When Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks in Paris that have killed at least 129 people, it warned that more would follow. French President, François Hollande, has in turn vowed to show "no mercy" in his response. This pledge is bound to have a profound effect on border controls and the treatment of Syrian refugees in the country. But France has the option to show the world that it will continue to stand for "liberté, égalité and fraternité."  Republicans are putting President Barack Obama and his party on the defensive over accepting Syrian refugees, following reports that one of the terrorists involved in the Paris attacks entered Europe as part of the wave of Syrians fleeing civil war. GOP governors and lawmakers were quick to announce they wouldn't allow Syrian refugees into their states and are appealing for stronger control of U.S. borders. The issue opens up a firm political line of attack for Republican presidential candidates who had been struggling to find their footing on the national security challenges posed by the Paris slaughter. The rhetoric on the right clearly angered Obama, who argued at a press conference Monday that the United States must remain committed to its values of tolerance and accepting immigrants.
