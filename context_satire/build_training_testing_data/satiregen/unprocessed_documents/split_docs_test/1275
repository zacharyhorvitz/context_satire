President of the United States, Donald Trump, threatened to raise tariffs on Mexico if it did not help to curb migration to the United States. In early June 2019, as part of a deal the United States, Mexico agreed to deploy the newly formed National Guard to their border with Guatemala. While the guard was always intended to enforce immigration policy, it was not intended to do so as soon as announced.  House Speaker John Boehner faces a looming threat from conservatives to oust him as speaker, and it's tying his hands on funding the Department of Homeland Security. Congress passed a one-week extension of funding just hours before the deadline on Friday night. It was that fear fueling Boehner's resistance to a longer-term bill, as it might prompt backlash from conservatives. President Barack Obama signed the bill, which funds the Department of Homeland Security through Friday.  House Speaker John Boehner had a message for reporters who want to know what he's going to do to keep the Department of Homeland Security: Pucker up. After batting away question after question about what the House will do if the Senate sends it a bill to fund Homeland Security, without including in it the attack on President Barack Obama's immigration actions that conservatives are seeking, the Ohio Republican responded to one by puckering his lips and making kissing noises in the reporter's direction. It was no Valentine from Boehner, who was suggesting that Capitol Hill reporters weren't going to get any more out of him. "When we make decisions, we'll let you know," Boehner said.
