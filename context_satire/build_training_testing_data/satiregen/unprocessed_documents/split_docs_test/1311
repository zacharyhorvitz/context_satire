 Donald Trump on Wednesday refused to say he would accept the result of the presidential election if he loses to Hillary Clinton, raising the possibility of an extraordinary departure from principles that have underpinned American democracy for more than two centuries. "I will look at it at the time," Trump said when asked during the final presidential debate whether he would concede if he loses on November 8, following his claims that the election is "rigged" against him. He added: "I will keep you in suspense." The comments at the Las Vegas showdown marked a stunning moment that has never been seen in the weeks before a modern presidential election.  The final in-person showdown between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump takes place on Wednesday night at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Here's what you need to know about the rules, format and structure of the third presidential debate: TIME: The debate will begin at 9 p.m. ET on CNN and other major networks. It will last 90 minutes, with no commercials and no breaks.  Donald Trump's campaign manager on Thursday dismissed suggestions the Republican nominee is undercutting American democracy by refusing to say whether he will accept the results of the election if he loses. In an at-times contentious interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day," Kellyanne Conway tried to clarify Trump's comments that he would take a wait-and-see approach before accepting the outcome. "What Donald Trump has said, over time, if you take all of his statements together, he has said that he will respect the results of the election," said Conway, a veteran Republican pollster who was named Trump's campaign manager in August. At Wednesday night's presidential debate, Trump -- who has repeatedly said the election is rigged against him and claimed there is  "large scale" vote fraud -- refused to say whether he will accept the results on November 8.
