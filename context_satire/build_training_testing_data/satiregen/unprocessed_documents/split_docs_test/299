 Japan has given a stark warning to Britain that its big companies -- and others -- would have to quit the country if trade barriers after Brexit wipe out their profit margins. After meeting Prime Minister Theresa May with a delegation of top Japanese executives, Japan's ambassador to the U.K., Koji Tsuruoka, was asked about the threat of new obstacles to trade between Britain and the European Union, the country's biggest export market. "If there is no profitability of continuing operations in the U.K. - not Japanese only - then no private company can continue operations," he told reporters. "So it is as simple as that," the official added.  Japan's Princess Mako and her commoner fiance Kei Komuro have postponed their highly anticipated engagement and wedding until at least 2020, saying they were not yet ready for marriage. The wedding, which had been set for November, was to be a momentous occasion for the country and the Japanese royal family, led by Emperor Akihito, who plans to abdicate in April 2019. But the couple said they were now having second thoughts about marrying so soon. "It is because of our immaturity and we just regret it," the couple said in a statement Tuesday.  Japan already has the world's smartest toilets, but now there are smart shoes, furniture and accessories. You might remember Nissan's 2016 marketing maneuver, when the Japanese carmaker introduced a line of self-driving chairs that could autonomously glide together using cameras and sensors. This time, the auto innovators have taken aim at traditional hospitality and everyday objects. Drawing from the autonomous parking technology of the Nissan Leaf car, which debuted in October, the ProPILOT Park Ryokan hotel comes kitted out with all kinds of intuitive amenities.
