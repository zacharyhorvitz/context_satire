 Democratic Party rising star Stacey Abrams sharply criticized the Trump administration and Republican leadership on Tuesday night in her response to the President's State of the Union address. Abrams blamed the President for the recent partial government shutdown, which became the longest in US history, calling it "a stunt engineered by the President," and argued that the aspirations of American families "are being crushed by Republican leadership that ignores real life or just doesn't understand it." The 45-year-old narrowly lost a gubernatorial bid in the reliably red state of Georgia last fall, but rose to national prominence in the process. She made history as the first black woman to give the Democratic response to the State of the Union.  Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said Tuesday she has accepted an invitation to give the Democratic response to the State of the Union address. Abrams has been talked about as a rising star in the Democratic Party. She gained a national following during her unsuccessful bid to become governor of Georgia last fall. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday said he called Abrams three weeks ago to discuss the idea and that she has since accepted.  The news that 2018 Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams would give the Democratic response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address next Tuesday cements her as a national figure and one of the brightest young stars within the party. But Abrams' stardom is a tenuous thing. Yes, she came very, very close to winning the governor's race and, in the process, becoming the first black woman to be elected governor anywhere in the country. But she fell short.
