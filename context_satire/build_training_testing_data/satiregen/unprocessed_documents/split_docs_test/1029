In 1867 in Vevey, Switzerland, Henri Nestlé developed milk-based baby food and soon began marketing it. The following year, Daniel Peter began seven years of work perfecting the milk chocolate manufacturing process. Nestlé was the solution Peter needed to fix his problem of removing all the water from the milk added to his chocolate, thus preventing the product from developing mildew. Henri Nestlé retired in 1875 but the company, under new ownership, retained his name as Société Farine Lactée Henri Nestlé. Rolo (pronounced /ˈrəʊləʊ/), referring to the roll-styled candy, is a brand of truncated cone-shaped or conical frustum-shaped chocolates with a caramel middle. First manufactured in the United Kingdom by Mackintosh's in 1937 (followed by Rowntree's after the takeover in 1969), they are made by Nestlé (except in the United States, where production has been licensed to The Hershey Company). A long-running British advertising slogan for the brand was "Do you love anyone enough to give them your last Rolo?" A YouGov poll saw Rolo ranked the twelfth most popular and seventeenth most famous confectionary in the UK. In May 2018, it was announced that Nestlé and Starbucks struck a $7.15 billion distribution deal, which allows Nestlé to market, sell and distribute Starbucks coffee globally and to incorporate the brand's coffee varieties into Nestlé's proprietary single-serve system, expanding the overseas markets for both companies.
