Since March 1966, Richard has followed the practice of giving away at least a tenth of his income to charity. Richard has stated that two biblical principles have guided him in how to use his money. He said: "Firstly, it was the love of money (not money itself) that was the root of all evil. Secondly, to be good and responsible stewards of what was entrusted to us." Blevins had gotten his start into streaming through participating in several esports teams in competitive play for Halo 3, but his popularity started to increase when he and a lot of other streamers began playing Fortnite Battle Royale in October 2017; and when Fortnite blew up into the mainstream in early 2018, Blevins’ popularity took off. Blevins’ increase in popularity fed back to help make Fortnite more popular. Prior to retiring his Twitch profile of streaming in favor of Mixer on August 1, 2019, Blevins had over 14 million followers and was the most-followed active Twitch channel. On August 1, 2019, Blevins left Twitch to stream exclusively on Microsoft's Mixer platform on August 1, 2019. His wife and manager Jessica told The Verge that the contract with Twitch had limited the ability for Ninja to grow his brand outside of video gaming, and that because of the state of Twitch's community, "it really seemed like he was kind of losing himself and his love for streaming."
