 The death of Brent Taylor -- the North Ogden, Utah, mayor and soldier who was killed Saturday in Afghanistan -- reverberated far beyond his small city in northern Utah. People around the country are mourning the loss of the National Guardsman who was finishing up his latest tour of duty in the war-torn country when he was killed in a so-called "insider" attack. But despite the grief, many are finding hope in the final message Taylor posted to Facebook, just days before he died. "As the USA gets ready to vote in our own election (Tuesday), I hope everyone back home exercises their precious right to vote," Taylor wrote in the post.  Early voting continues to be explosive, as an energized American electorate weighs in on its government. As of early Tuesday morning, at least 33 million people have voted early nationwide, according to data collected by Catalist, a data company that works with Democrats and others, to compile counts of ballots cast before Election Day, either early in-person or by mail. That's far more than the 22 million early votes cast in the entire 2014 election. The data suggests an electorate deeply engaged in voters' first real opportunity to offer a verdict on the presidency of Donald Trump, who has actively tried to turn the election into a referendum on himself.  A Native American tribe is suing to stop North Dakota's new voter identification law before the midterm election vote next week, saying that the law disenfranchises voters living on reservations. The complaint centers around a state voter ID law that requires voters to provide a form of identification that includes their legal name, current street address and date of birth. The plaintiffs say the street address requirement poses a unique challenge to Native Americans who live on reservations or in rural areas, as the street names and residential addressees there have been assigned in incomplete or inconsistent ways. The federally-recognized Spirit Lake Tribe filed a complaint Tuesday against North Dakota Secretary of State Alvin Jaeger that reads: "Jaeger's implementation of the residential address requirement has imposed severe—sometimes insurmountable—burdens on the right to vote for many voters on reservations."
