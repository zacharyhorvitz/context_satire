Claire Tully was refused by two breast cancer charities who rebuffed her offer to raise money on their behalf. This was linked to her debut as Ireland's first Page 3 model in 2008. After being turned down by the Marie Keating Foundation and Breast Cancer Ireland, Tully's donation was eventually accepted by the National Breast Cancer Research Institute at NUI Galway and she was said to bear "no hard feelings" towards the other charities. Jill Clark, head of fundraising, said: "The society is delighted that Claire has kindly chosen to donate all the proceeds raised throughout the duration of her appearance on the show to Action Breast Cancer, a programme of the Irish Cancer Society." Roxy is the owner of The Hump Bar, a local bar off post popular with service personnel and her circle of Army wives based at Fort Marshall. She "inherited" it from Betty in Season 2 when Betty leaves for California after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Gloria is now the manager since the LeBlancs have moved to Washington but Roxy continues to own it. The Narrator meets Bob at a support group for testicular cancer.

The increased estrogen levels caused him to grow large breasts and to develop a softer voice.
