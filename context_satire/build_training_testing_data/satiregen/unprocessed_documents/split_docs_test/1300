 President Donald Trump is taking his case to the American people over why they should back him in the partial government shutdown. His primetime address on Tuesday will be about the "Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border," he tweeted. But Trump is facing an uphill climb: polls show a majority of Americans blame him and Republicans for the shutdowns, and the majority have also consistently been opposed to his idea of a border wall with Mexico. The average of polls taken since the shutdown began indicate that Americans are blaming Republicans for the shutdown.  As the partial government shutdown nears the one-month mark, there have been a number of public opinion polls examining how the public feels about the shutdown, which was sparked by a funding standoff over President Donald Trump's proposal for a new wall along the border with Mexico. Six high-quality polls have been released this week touching on Trump, the shutdown, the Democrats in Congress and the wall. Most confirmed what we already knew from before the shutdown started: Opposition to a border wall is widespread and deep. But beyond that general opposition, the new polls offer some consistent results, including: Blame, in the public's mind, rests largely at the White House Many object to the shutdown, especially as a tactic to build the wall, Few see a wall as an effective way to combat undocumented immigration.  Only 18% of Americans said they could trust the government in Washington to do what's right "just about always" or "most of the time" -- nearly the lowest that marker has ever been -- in a December 2017 survey by Pew Research. That was well before the longest government shutdown in history. A more recent but slightly different survey from Gallup asked how much trust and confidence people had in the government when it comes to handling domestic problems. Fifty-four percent said in the September 2018 Gallup survey that they had either "not very much" confidence or "none at all" in the federal government in Washington handling domestic problems.
