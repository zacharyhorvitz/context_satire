Major League Baseball (MLB) is a professional baseball organization. It is the oldest of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. A total of 30 teams play in Major League Baseball: 15 teams in the National League (NL) and 15 in the American League (AL). The NL and AL were formed as separate legal entities in 1876 and 1901, respectively.  Manchester City cleared a major hurdle in the quest to win back-to-back English Premier League titles for the first time in its history with a battling 2-0 victory at the home of crosstown rival Manchester United on Wednesday. Second half goals from Bernardo Silva and substitute Leroy Sane secured the win as City wore down and eventually outclassed United. With just three games of the season remaining the Citizens now lead Liverpool atop the table by a solitary point. And with fixtures against Burnley, Leicester and Brighton to come, Pep Guardiola's men will now be red hot favorites to claim what will be its sixth ever league crown. Frank T.
