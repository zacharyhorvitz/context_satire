Beth Yeshurun Day School was the first Jewish Day School in Texas, founded in 1949 under the leadership of Rabbi William S. Malev, the rabbi of the congregation at that time. In 2009, Neil worked on a pilot for an A&E reality TV show. According to Neil, the program would follow him and his family after his parents moved in with him. As Neil told Eddie Trunk, "My wife  hasn't talked to my mom since the wedding", which took place January 9, 2005, in Las Vegas. At age 15, Behrs relocated with her family to Marin County, California. She began attending Tamalpais High School in 2001, and was accepted into the school's highly regarded drama program. She graduated from that high school in 2004. Behrs studied at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, and went on to perform in the musical Dangling Conversations: The Music of Simon and Garfunkel, and the plays Korczak's Children and A Bright Room Called Day.
