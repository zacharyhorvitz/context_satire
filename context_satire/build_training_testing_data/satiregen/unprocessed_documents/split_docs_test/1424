 Fed up with television coverage of Sen. John McCain's death and eager to continue promoting his agenda, President Donald Trump remained silent for most of Monday about the Vietnam War veteran being honored by the rest of Washington. Late in the day, and after urging from senior aides, he relented, offering brief plaudits for the recently passed lawmaker in a statement after responding to questions earlier only with silence. "Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain's service to our country," Trump wrote in the four-paragraph statement, which dealt mainly in the logistical details he'd approved for the week-long remembrance ceremonies. Later, while meeting with evangelical leaders in the State Dining Room, Trump said in prepared remarks, "Our hearts and prayers are going to the family of Senator John McCain.  Republican Sen. James Inhofe told reporters Monday that Sen. John McCain was "partially to blame" for the controversy over the lowering of the White House flag. Inhofe, a senior member of Senate Armed Services Committee, was highly complimentary of McCain but when asked about the flag flap he attributed it to the late senator's public spat with President Donald Trump in recent years. He described both men as "strong willed people." "Well, you know, frankly, I think that John McCain is partially to blame for that because he is very outspoken.  Just after midnight on Sunday night, the flag flying above the White House was hoisted back to full staff. Since Saturday evening, it had been positioned at half-staff to mark the death of Sen. John McCain, the former Vietnam prisoner of war and onetime Republican nominee for President. His death had sparked an outpouring of tributes from across the political spectrum, except at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. President Donald Trump initially tweeted condolences for McCain's family but did not praise the senator specifically.
