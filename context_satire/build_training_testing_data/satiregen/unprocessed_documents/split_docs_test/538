 Chiefs of tribal nations that once inhabited Georgia say that the Atlanta Braves' tomahawk chop is insensitive and inappropriate. The comments from Cherokee and Creek chiefs come after the Atlanta Braves said the team would hold a "continued dialogue" with Native Americans during the Major League Baseball offseason about whether to keep the decades-old tradition. The Braves did not specify which tribal nations it planned to talk to. "Although the Tomahawk Chop may be a game day tradition, it is not an appropriate acknowledgment of tribal tradition or culture," Muscogee (Creek) Nation Principal Chief James R. Floyd said in a statement to CNN.  President Donald Trump said again on Friday that Americans need identification to buy groceries, which remains not true. "You know, if you want to go out and buy groceries, you need identification. If you want to do almost anything you need identification. The only thing you don't need identification for is to vote, the most important single thing you're doing -- to vote," Trump said at a campaign rally in Lake Charles, Louisiana. In the United States, an American Indian tribe, Native American tribe, Alaska Native village, tribal nation, or similar concept is any extant or historical clan, tribe, band, nation, or other group or community of Native Americans in the United States. Modern forms of these entities are often associated with land or territory of an Indian reservation. "Federally recognized Indian tribe" is a legal term of art in United States law with a specific meaning. An Indian tribe recognized by the United States government usually possesses tribal sovereignty, a "dependent sovereign nation" status with the Federal Government that is similar to that of a state in some situations, and that of a nation in others.
