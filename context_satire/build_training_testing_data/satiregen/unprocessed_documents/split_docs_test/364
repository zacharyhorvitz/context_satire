The completed Chrysler Building garnered mixed reviews in the press. Van Alen was hailed as the "Doctor of Altitude" by Architect magazine, while architect Kenneth Murchison called Van Alen the "Ziegfeld of his profession", comparing him to popular Broadway producer Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.. The building was praised for being "an expression of the intense activity and vibrant life of our day", and for "teem with the spirit of modernism, ... the epitome of modern business life, stand for progress in architecture and in modern building methods." An anonymous critic wrote in Architectural Forum's October 1930 issue: "The Chrysler...stands by itself, something apart and alone. In June 2017, Lockheed Martin announced that the SR-72 would be in development by the early 2020s and is to top Mach 6. Executive Vice President Rob Weiss commented that "We've been saying hypersonics  two years away for the last 20 years, but all I can say is the technology is mature and we, along with DARPA and the services, are working hard to get that capability into the hands of our warfighters as soon as possible."  As a rugby player, Shane Williams was used to breaking records. Armed with evasive speed and a wicked sidestep, the diminutive winger crossed for 58 international tries during his career -- 18 more than any other Welsh player has managed. He also scored a record 57 times for club side Ospreys. But during his playing days he could hardly have envisaged the record he's about to attempt to break next.
