 Organic farming is widely perceived to be a healthy, more environmentally-friendly alternative to conventional agricultural techniques. But its role in providing for an increasingly crowded planet remains unclear with its merits hotly contested. New research looks set to refuel the debate revealing yields from organic farming to be, on average, 25% lower than conventionally-farmed produce. Reporting in the science journal Nature, researchers from Canada's McGill University and the U.S.'s University of Minnesota say that the differences are not uniform across every crop with some performing better than others. Inventions by University of Minnesota students and faculty have ranged from food science to health technologies. Most of the public research funding in Minnesota is funneled to the University of Minnesota as a result of long-standing advocacy by the university itself. The RHEDC eventually identified the need for a branch campus of the University of Minnesota system that could integrate with the health sciences programs and needs of the Mayo Clinic. The group promoted the University of Minnesota system as the only higher education provider in a position to carry out this ideal, in spite of the existing branch campus of Winona State University - Rochester and Rochester Community and Technical College. The RHEDC report was drafted and delivered to the legislature and the governor. The recommendations of the report were adopted by the governor, the legislature and the University of Minnesota Board of Regents.
