Tarantino discovered the centerpiece for the work in 2009 while filming a movie with an actor that had the same stunt double for 20 years. Even though there was nothing but a small bit for the stuntman to do, Tarantino was asked to use him, and he agreed. The relationship fascinated Tarantino and inspired him to make a film about Hollywood. Tarantino said that while the stuntman may have been a perfect double for the actor years earlier, at the time he had come to meet them, "this was maybe the last or second-to-last thing they'd be doing together".  Sylvester Stallone doesn't get back in the ring in "Creed," but he still comes away as a big winner in this far-fetched but likeable offshoot of the geriatric "Rocky" series, as he may be more appealing playing the aging Rocky Balboa than he's been since the beginning of his 40-year career. Essentially taking on the role of Burgess Meredith's old trainer Mickey character from the series' early days, the veteran actor delightfully registers as a paisano from the old neighborhood, a man of the streets who's lived his life, fought his battles and has no more scores to settle. From the points of view of director-co-writer Ryan Coogler and star Michael B. Jordan, this marks some major mainstreaming after their bracing 2013 breakthrough with "Fruitvale Station"; dramatically, it's the same old "Rocky" formula applied now to the hitherto unknown son of the late Apollo Creed. It worked before and, commercially, looks to work again.  Each year, I and several other Hollywood Reporter editors put together the roundtables that are a defining element of this publication's awards coverage through the Emmy and Oscar seasons. For those not fully versed in the arcana of Hollywood, the awards work like this: people produce a vast amount of film and television, some of it awful, some exceptional, and a whole lot in between. Getting a shiny statuette (either an Oscar or Emmy) tells the world which side of the spectrum they fall on; this is the ultimate validation that sets a winner apart from the pack. One award can change the trajectory of a whole career, save a network, and even resuscitate the fortunes of an ailing executive.
