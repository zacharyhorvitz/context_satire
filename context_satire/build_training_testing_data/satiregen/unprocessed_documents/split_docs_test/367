 The White House removed a section of its daily public newsletter on Thursday that suggested President Donald Trump had instructed the Justice Department to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his family. The newsletter language, which was first reported by the Daily Beast, had said on Wednesday: "This year President Trump has asked Ukraine to fully cooperate with the Justice Department's investigation into the actions of former Vice President Joe Biden and his family in Ukraine." According to the Daily Beast, the paragraph was altered by early Thursday to say the President "has asked Ukraine to fully cooperate with any Justice Department's investigation into the actions of former Vice President Joe Biden and his family in Ukraine." And later Thursday, the paragraph was deleted from the October 2 newsletter page before the entire webpage was updated with the next day's newsletter issue. The AGM-176 Griffin is a lightweight, precision-guided munition developed by Raytheon. It can be launched from the ground or air as a rocket-powered missile or dropped from the air as a guided bomb. It carries a relatively small warhead, and was designed to be a precision low-collateral damage weapon for irregular warfare. It has been used in combat by the United States military during the War in Afghanistan.  The Trump administration has informally notified Congress that it will soon announce the approval of an arms sale to Ukraine involving Javelin anti-tank missiles, a US official and congressional aide told CNN this week. The formal announcement that the State Department has approved the sale is expected soon and congressional notifications are ongoing. Congress is expected to be supportive of the package. Bloomberg was first to report that the sale had been informally approved.
