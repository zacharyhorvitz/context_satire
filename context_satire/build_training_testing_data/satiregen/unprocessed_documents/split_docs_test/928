The film begins at the beheading of Anne Boleyn, which turns out to be an erotic daydream that introduces protagonist Kevin, who is having sexual fantasies when he's supposed to be doing his history homework. Kevin has tried to lose his virginity for three years. He and his best friend Perry go to a newsagent's to buy a pornographic magazine. Like all of Kevin's previous attempts at sexual exploration, this ends in failure. In the film, Tate goes to see The Wrecking Crew at the Bruin Theater. She convinces the theater's employees that she stars in the movie after they fail to recognize her. Tarantino stated the idea came to him from an experience he had. When True Romance was released, he saw it at the same theater, where he eventually convinced its employees that he wrote the script. Aside from playing video games, Kevin's one aim in life is to lose his virginity, or at least to prove that he has a girlfriend. From boasting about the (imagined) joys of sex to placing the nozzle of a vacuum cleaner to his neck to look as though he has received a love bite, he is determined to prove that he has "done it". He eventually does lose his virginity during a drunken party in the final episode of Harry Enfield and Chums. The following morning, he wakes up transformed into a nice, polite and helpful young man.
