The gazebo was dedicated on February 1, 1994, to a mixed reception. Los Angeles Times art critic Christopher Knight called it "the most depressingly awful work of public art in recent years", representing the opposite of Hardwicke's intended tribute to women. "Sex, as a woman's historic gateway to Hollywood", he wrote, "couldn't be more explicitly described". Independent writer and film producer Gail Choice called it a fitting tribute to a group of pioneering and courageous women who "carried a tremendous burden on their feminine shoulders. Hollywood is considered the oldest film industry where earliest film studios and production companies emerged, it is also the birthplace of various genres of cinema—among them comedy, drama, action, the musical, romance, horror, science fiction, and the war epic—having set an example for other national film industries.  For the second year in a row Hollywood's leading women let fly a clarion call, setting the industry to rights. Following Cate Blanchett's remarks last year, in which the Best Actress winner excoriated the industry for its focus of male-centric filmmaking, Best Supporting Actress winner Patricia Arquette rounded on America's attitude to gender inequality. Reading from a prepared speech Arquette dedicated her award to "every woman who gave birth, to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation. We have fought for everybody else's equal rights, it's our time to have wage equality once and for all, and equal rights for women in the United States of America."
