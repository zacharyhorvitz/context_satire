Jonathan Greening (born 2 January 1979) is an English former professional footballer and coach who played as a midfielder. Greening began his career in 1996 with York City, but moved to Manchester United in 1998, with whom he won the 1998â€“99 UEFA Champions League as a non-playing substitute in the final. However, he failed to make a breakthrough in the Manchester United first team and followed United assistant manager Steve McClaren to Middlesbrough in 2001. During his time at Middlesbrough, Greening earned his first call-up to the England national team, but he did not make an appearance.
