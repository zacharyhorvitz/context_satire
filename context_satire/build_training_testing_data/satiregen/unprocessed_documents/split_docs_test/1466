 Donald Trump says Univision and NBC "abandoned" the 51 women vying for the Miss USA crown by canceling the upcoming pageant telecast. Organizers of the annual event, half-owned by Trump and scheduled for July 12, are arranging for a live-stream of the pageant now that the two networks have backed out of airing it. Univision and NBC did so, they said, because of the offensive nature of Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants. The broadcasters were facing sustained protests from Hispanic leadership groups.  Univision is blasting a lawsuit brought by Donald Trump as "both factually false and legally ridiculous." The billionaire businessman filed the $500 million lawsuit after the broadcaster decided not to air the Miss USA pageant over Trump's widely criticized remarks about Mexican immigrants. In a lengthy statement on Tuesday, he accused Univision of engaging in a "politically motivated attempt to suppress Mr. Trump's freedom of speech under the First Amendment as he begins to campaign for the nation's presidency." Univision, America's largest Spanish-language broadcaster, announced last week that it will end its deal with the Trump Organization that gave the network the rights to broadcast Miss USA in Spanish.  Days after the Miss USA pageant was dropped by Univision and NBC, the July 12 event has found a new home on television, the Reelz channel. Reelz, a relatively obscure cable channel, saw an opportunity to fill the space left by NBC. It says it's helping to "save the sash." The Miss USA organization is half owned by Donald Trump.
