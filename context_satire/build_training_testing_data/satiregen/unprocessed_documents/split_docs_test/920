 It's hard to imagine how the past three days could have gone worse for Republicans. The public impeachment hearings were never going to be a good thing for Trump -- given that the proceedings were controlled by the House Democratic majority and we knew, from a series of closed-door depositions over the past month, that the witnesses who would be called had a) expressed deep misgivings about President Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 and b) suggested that there was a not-so-secret quid pro quo in place that unless the Ukrainians announced an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden they would not get the White House meeting with the President they so desired. But even by those standards, what happened over the past 72 hours was a disaster the likes of which not even the most pessimistic Republican could have predicted. The Wednesday testimony of US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland was obviously the pivot point of the week.  Fiona Hill, the last witness in two weeks of televised impeachment hearings, made the case against her old boss President Donald Trump better than Democrats ever have. The former National Security Council official on Thursday distilled the fog of shady dealings and competition between Trump appointees and career bureaucrats with a crystal clear condemnation of his rogue foreign policy operation in Ukraine. And she also effectively warned that the Republican defense of the President -- by peddling Ukraine conspiracy theories -- was in danger, in itself, of becoming an extension of the 2016 Russian election scheme that is tearing American politics apart and draining public confidence in its democracy. Hill -- a British-born, non-partisan Russia expert who also wrote a book on Vladimir Putin -- was the star witness in a day of testimony that brought many of the threads of the Democratic case together.  Fiona Hill, President Donald Trump's former top Russia adviser, testified publicly on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Hill, a former national security adviser until she left the administration this summer, told lawmakers that US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland was involved in a "domestic political errand" in Ukraine, while she and others were trying to stay involved in "national security foreign policy." She told Congress that it was obvious to her that when Trump's aides mentioned "Burisma," a Ukrainian energy company, that they were really thinking about former Vice President Joe Biden. And she forcefully rejected and dismantled the notion that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election to harm Trump, calling it a "fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves."
