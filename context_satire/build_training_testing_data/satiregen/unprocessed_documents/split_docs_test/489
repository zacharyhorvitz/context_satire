Following the formation of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue and the birth of their son Ronnie in October 1960, they were married in Tijuana in 1962. In his 1999 autobiography, Turner claimed that he was still legally married to Alice Bell when he married Tina; Turner states that he located Bell in Chicago and divorced her. Turner claimed on more than one occasion that he had never been officially married to Tina. He contributed to her autobiography, I, Tina, stating that they went to Mexico to see "sex shows and whores". On July 1, 1976, the Ike & Tina Turner Revue flew to Dallas, Texas where they had a gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. While en route to the hotel, the Turners got into a physical altercation in the limousine. Soon after their arrival, Tina fled to the nearby Ramada Inn and later hid at several friends' homes. On July 27, 1976, Tina filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences. In 1991, Ike & Tina Turner were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Ike Turner was incarcerated and Tina Turner did not attend; stating through her publicist she was taking a leave of absence following her Foreign Affair European Tour and that she felt "emotionally unequipped to return to the U.S. and respond to the night of celebration in the manner she would want." Phil Spector accepted the honor on their behalf.
