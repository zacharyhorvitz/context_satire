 Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell said Thursday that President Donald Trump's attacks on her and her late husband Rep. John Dingell will not intimidate her and that she doesn't want an apology from the President. Trump, speaking at a rally Wednesday night in Battle Creek, Michigan, implied the former congressman, whose seat is now held by his wife, was "looking up" from hell. He said that he gave the family the "A-plus treatment" after John Dingell died, and that the congresswoman told him during an emotional call following John Dingell's funeral that her husband would have been "thrilled" by the respect shown for him during his funeral and "he's looking down" on the ceremonies. "Maybe he's looking up," Trump said at the rally, drawing some moans and groans from those at the rally, which was about two hours away from Debbie Dingell's district.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday responded to President Donald Trump's attacks on Democratic congresswoman Debbie Dingell and her late husband Rep. John Dingell. Asked about the President's insinuation at a rally in Michigan last night that the late congressman is "looking up" from hell, Pelosi was somber, saying, "Let us pray for the President," and adding that Trump "clearly is insecure." "Let us pray. Let us pray for the President.  Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Donald Trump, issued a rare rebuke of the President on Thursday when he said Trump's crude attack on the late Rep. John Dingell is "not funny." Trump drew widespread criticism on Wednesday when, during a rally in Dingell's home state of Michigan, he implied that the late Democratic congressman was "looking up" from hell. "The bottom line is, it's not a funny joke and you're not helping yourself," Graham, speaking to reporters following a meeting with the President at the White House, said he told Trump. Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said that there's "no personal animosity" between Trump and Dingell, arguing that Trump had "made sure" that Dingell was "honored as being one of the greatest members of the House ever" with a full military funeral.
