 For months now, the Equal Rights Amendment has been on the brink of becoming federal law. Virginia might be the state to put it over the top. Jennifer Carroll Foy, a Virginia legislator, just wrapped a tour across the state campaigning for the ERA, which says that "Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex." It was passed by Congress in 1972 but still has yet to be ratified by the states more than four decades later.  The tribe that appears to have killed American John Allen Chau on remote North Sentinel Island in the Bay of Bengal is one of a number of vanishing peoples sealed off from the rest of the world. The Sentinelese, as they're known, are protected by Indian law to preserve their way of life and protect them from modern illnesses to which they have no immunity. Laws banning outsiders from going within five nautical miles of the island are also there to protect strangers because the tribe, which has lived on the island for tens of thousands of years, has a history of forcefully repelling outsiders. Their numbers have declined in recent years, but accurate counts are hard to obtain because the Sentinelese can only be observed from a distance due to the dangers in approaching the tribe.  Carlos Gomez took a break last month on a potholed road in southern Mexico littered with abandoned shoes and empty water bottles. The journey's toll was etched across his face. "I am feeling some chills," Gomez said. "I have had a fever for a few days."
