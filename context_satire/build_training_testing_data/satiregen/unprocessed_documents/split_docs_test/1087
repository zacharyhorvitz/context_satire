 Thousands of Palestinians gathered Tuesday for the grim task of burying the 60 protesters killed by Israeli troops at the Gaza border, as Israel faced international condemnation over the deaths. Funerals took place across Gaza on Tuesday, a day after Israeli troops fired on Palestinians gathered at the border to protest the controversial relocation of the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 60 people were killed on Monday and another two died in clashes on Tuesday. United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres was "profoundly alarmed" by Israel's actions on Monday,  a spokesman said.  Three Palestinians were shot and killed while attempting to cross into Israel from southern Gaza on Sunday, according to the Israeli military. A fourth Palestinian also attempted to enter with the group, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement, though it wouldn't comment on the person's condition or location. Two of the deceased were identified by the Palestinian Ministry of Health as 23-year-old Bahaa Qdeih and 20-year-old Mohammed Abu Rida. "In this incident, an attempt to damage the security infrastructure, breach Israel's sovereignty and carry out an attack was thwarted," a statement from the IDF said.  The US officially relocated its embassy to Jerusalem on Monday, formally upending decades of American foreign policy in a move that was met with clashes and protests along the Gaza-Israeli border. Here is what we know: Casualties At least 58 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces during Monday and Tuesday clashes, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Live updates Israeli soldiers have killed more than 100 people since the latest wave of protests began in March, according to a CNN count based on the Palestinian Ministry of Health figures. The dead include 8-month-old Laila Anwar Ghandour, who died of tear-gas asphyxiation, the Ministry of Health said.
