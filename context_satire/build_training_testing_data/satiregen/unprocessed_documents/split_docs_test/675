 The boards of US Airways and American Airlines parent AMR agreed to a long-anticipated deal Wednesday night that could create the world's largest airline, according to a source familiar with the talks. The official announcement is planned for early Thursday. The new airline will beef up American's network, particularly along the East Coast, where US Airways is a major player with its Washington-New York Shuttle and hubs in Philadelphia and Charlotte. The combination of US Air and AMR, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2011, is the latest in a series of moves that have whittled what were 10 major airlines 2001 down to four mega-carriers.  US Airways and American Airlines are joining forces in an $11 billion deal to create the world's largest airline. The new airline, which will use the American Airlines name, will beef up American's network, particularly along the East Coast, where US Airways is a major player with its Washington-New York Shuttle and hubs in Philadelphia and Charlotte. The proposed merger of US Air and American parent AMR, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2011, is the latest in a series of moves that have combined what were 10 major airlines in 2001 into four mega-carriers. The combined US Airways-American joins United Continental, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines as the industry's dominant players in the United States. On February 14, 2013, US Airways Group and AMR Corporation officially announced that the two companies would merge to form the largest airline in the world. The combined airline will carry the American Airlines name and branding, while US Airways' management team, including CEO Doug Parker, will retain most operational management positions. The headquarters for the new airline will also be consolidated at American's current headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas.
