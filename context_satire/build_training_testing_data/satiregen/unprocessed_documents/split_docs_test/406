 To quash what he described as "irrational fear," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday he'll ride one of the three subway lines taken by the latest Ebola patient in the United States. "There's no reason for New Yorkers to panic or feel that they have anything to worry about on the subway system," the Democrat told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day," adding that he plans to ride either the A, L or 1 train on Friday. Craig Spencer, a doctor who recently returned from Guinea, tested positive for Ebola on Thursday in New York, becoming the fourth person diagnosed with the virus in the United States.  A doctor who recently returned from Guinea has tested positive for Ebola -- the first case of the deadly virus in New York City and the fourth diagnosed in the United States. Here is a timeline of Craig Spencer's movements since he got back from the West African nation:  When did he return from Guinea? Spencer came back to the United States last week after treating Ebola patients in Guinea, where he worked for Doctors Without Borders. He completed his work in Guinea on October 12 and left the country two days later via Brussels, Belgium.  A mandatory 21-day quarantine imposed by New York and New Jersey on health care workers returning from West Africa after treating Ebola patients caught local and federal officials by surprise and spurred a heated debate on handling the spread of the virus. The policy of isolating medical personnel and others arriving from Ebola-affected countries zones was abruptly implemented Friday by the governors of New York and New Jersey, Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie. The announcement came one day after a New York doctor who treated patients in Guinea became the first Ebola case diagnosed in the city and the fourth in the United States. The mandate came as a surprise to the federal Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention in Atlanta, according to a federal official familiar with the situation.
