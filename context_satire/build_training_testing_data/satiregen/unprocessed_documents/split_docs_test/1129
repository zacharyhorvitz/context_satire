One of Velasquez's earliest musical memories was listening to her father, Gerardo Velasquez, sing lullabies to put her to sleep. As a child she enjoyed hearing classic songs. She would wait for her father's return from work and ask him to sing her the "old songs" he knew until she fell asleep. She was drawn to traditional songs instead of nursery rhymes because of this routine. Velasquez is a soprano and is often praised for her range and technical ability. Elvin Luciano of CNN Philippines complimented her "trademark and sometimes melismatic vocals", while AllMusic's David Gonzales adds her singing is "strong, emotive, and confident". However, she has often been criticized for excessive usage of belting and oversinging. AllMusic described her timbre as "thin, unimpressive and unappealing at times" and observed her singing as "aiming for a higher ,  she did all too often." Two years after the release of her debut album, Velasquez represented the Philippines in the 1989 Asia Pacific Singing Contest in Hong Kong. She went on to win the contest, performing the songs "You'll Never Walk Alone" from the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel and "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" from the musical Dreamgirls.
