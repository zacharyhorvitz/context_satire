 Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus gave voice Wednesday to the mistrust between his party and President Barack Obama after the President said he was "not going to just wait" on Republicans to pass comprehensive immigration reform. "I don't believe a thing he says," Priebus said Wednesday, when asked by CNN's Erin Burnett about working with the president. "All he's been doing for the last year is lying to Hispanic voters across the country." While both parties said Wednesday that they hoped to find common ground, they also signaled imminent conflict.  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy tied his party's 2016 White House prospects to the election just one week away -- and how Republicans govern over the next two years. Speaking at a fundraiser in Long Island this weekend, the No. 2 House Republican told donors that Republicans need to win back the Senate this year and govern effectively in Congress beginning in January to have a chance at seating a Republican in the Oval Office. "If we don't capture the House stronger, and the Senate, and prove we could govern, there won't be a Republican president in 2016," McCarthy said, according to a Politico profile published Sunday.  President Barack Obama isn't ceding ground on his most controversial policies despite an election that delivered a stinging rebuke to him and his party on Capitol Hill. During a roughly 90-minute press conference Wednesday, Obama gave no sign that he'd accept major revisions to his signature health care law, change his mind on bypassing Congress on immigration or consent to Republican demands on energy and the environment. Indeed, the President didn't do much to suggest that his White House would work differently after Republicans won at least 52 seats in the Senate and their biggest majority in the House since World War II. While Obama made clear he had no desire to reshape his agenda, he did acknowledge that voters dealt his party a dramatic defeat on Tuesday.
