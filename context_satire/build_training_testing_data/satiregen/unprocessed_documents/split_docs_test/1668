Although Indiana is usually considered a Republican stronghold, Mourdock lost the general election to Democratic nominee Joe Donnelly after the media attention over his comment in a debate that "life is that gift from God that I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen." Dan Parker, chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party said, "As a pro-life Catholic, I'm stunned and ashamed that Richard Mourdock believes God intended rape". He also said, "Victims of rape are victims of an extremely violent act, and mine is not a violent God. Do we need any more proof that Richard Mourdock is an extremist who's out of touch with Hoosiers?" The day after the debate, Mourdock issued a statement saying, "God creates life, and that was my point. Controversial comments about rape and abortion also came from other Republican legislators and legislative candidates. Following Todd Akin's comments, reporters at the Pennsylvania Press Club asked Pennsylvania Republican Senate candidate Tom Smith on August 27, 2012, how, considering his no-exceptions anti-abortion stance, he would tell a daughter or granddaughter who had been raped that she must keep the pregnancy. Smith said that he had been in a similar situation because his daughter had become pregnant out of wedlock. He said that he was not equating the two situations but that a father's position was similar.
