In February 2020, after Mattel Television ended the deal to broadcast the British television series Thomas & Friends on Nickelodeon in the US, they made a deal to stream the show in March of 2020, making it the first time in years that Thomas content was available on Netflix.  Netflix may be losing Michael Scott and Chandler Bing, but it's gaining Jerry Seinfeld and Cosmo Kramer. "Seinfeld," one of the most popular sitcoms in TV history, is heading to Netflix starting in 2021, the streaming company announced on Monday. Netflix will be the exclusive global streaming home to the sitcom. The financial terms of the deal, which Netflix struck with distributor Sony Pictures Television, were not disclosed.  "Game of Thrones" led the charge at the Creative Arts Emmys with a total of 10 wins for the fantasy show. Amazon's popular comedy "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" also did well during the night, with a total of six wins. HBO's "Chernobyl" and Nat Geo's Oscar-winning documentary "Free Solo" each picked up seven awards. Heading into the Primetime Emmy Awards next Sunday, HBO leads networks and streaming services with 25 wins, followed closely by Netflix with 23.
