 Some Republican politicians may be abandoning Donald Trump over his derogatory and vulgar comments about women, but he still has a friend in UK politician Nigel Farage. The Brexit campaign leader came out swinging for the Republican presidential nominee after Sunday night's debate in St. Louis, telling multiple outlets that Trump looked like a "silverback gorilla" who "dominated" opponent Hillary Clinton. Buzzfeed's Ben Smith caught up with Farage in the post-debate spin room and asked the former British politician to expand on his comparison. "He looked like a big gorilla prowling the set.  It's almost time for round two of the official presidential debates. Here's how to watch it on CNN. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will take the stage for the second of three presidential debates, on Sunday at 9:00 p.m. ET.  Mike Pence gave a full-throated endorsement of his embattled running mate Monday afternoon, the first time he has publicly addressed Donald Trump's crude remarks caught on tape in 2005 since they were released three days ago. "You saw that on the stage last night. You know, it takes a big man to know when he is wrong and to admit it and to have the humility to apologize and be transparent and be vulnerable with people and Donald Trump last night showed that he is a big man," Pence told a few hundred supporters during the mid-day campaign stop. The Indiana governor cut right to the chase at the top of his speech, broaching the debate and Trump's apology simultaneously.
