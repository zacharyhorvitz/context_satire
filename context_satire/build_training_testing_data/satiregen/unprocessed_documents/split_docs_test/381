 President Barack Obama went beyond criticizing foreign powers at the United Nations on Monday to take veiled shots at Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, though he didn't mention any by name. The President slammed the notion of "building of walls to keep out immigrants," which several GOP candidates, including Trump, have espoused and generally the "politics of us versus them." Obama's comments marked a rare moment when a president used an address to the global body as a venue for singling out domestic political opponents. Obama, however, didn't limit his attacks to Republicans, noting that some on the other side of the aisle have made similar objections.  President Barack Obama got much closer Monday to locking in a major part of his legacy: the biggest regional free trade deal in history. But first he has to win the political battle in Congress and on the 2016 presidential campaign trail. Trade negotiators' announcement that they've reached a deal on the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership starts the clock on a politically fraught process that will drop the deal into a combustible Congress, where populists in both parties oppose it, in the midst of a presidential campaign. And 2016 candidates will weigh in -- some with the potential to fan the flames of discontent on Capitol Hill and with both parties' most loyal voters.  President Barack Obama will visit Roseburg, Oregon, Friday following the mass shooting at an Oregon community college last week that killed 10 people, including the shooter, according to a White House official. "On Friday, October 9, the President will travel to Roseburg, Oregon, to visit privately with families of victims of the shooting. Further details about the President's travel to Oregon will be made available in the coming days," the official told CNN. On the day of the shootings, Obama made impassioned remarks, once again renewing his call for tougher gun legislation.
