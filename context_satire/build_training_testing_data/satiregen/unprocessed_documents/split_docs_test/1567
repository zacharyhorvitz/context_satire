 If you think you're too tired for sex, you're not alone. According to a large new study, women over age 50 who get fewer than seven hours of sleep are less likely to report being sexually active than their peers who sleep more, a problem that increases with age. Sleep disorders can also interfere with sex. Research suggests that men with obstructive sleep apnea, a condition marked by snoring and breathing difficulties, have decreased levels of sexual activity, possibly because they produce lower amounts of testosterone.  They may look cute, and you may think of them as your pets, but experts ask that you keep your chickens in your backyard. Don't snuggle with them. Don't sit them next to you as you watch TV. And please, don't commit a fashion foul and dress them in tiny costumes, no matter how adorable.
