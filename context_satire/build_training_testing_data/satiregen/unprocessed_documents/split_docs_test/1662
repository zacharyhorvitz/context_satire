 President Donald Trump on Monday praised Judge Brett Kavanaugh as "one of the finest people that I've ever known" in his first public comments since the Supreme Court nominee was publicly accused of sexual assault, and he criticized Democrats for not releasing information about the allegation sooner. While he heaped praise on his nominee, Trump said he supports going "through a full process" to "hear everybody out" on the matter and accepted the possibility that Kavanaugh's nomination could be delayed as a result. "Judge Kavanaugh is one of the finest people that I've ever known. He's an outstanding intellect, an outstanding judge, respected by everybody.  President Donald Trump said he would have pushed Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination through the Senate two weeks ago if he were responsible for the proceedings. "They could have pushed it through two weeks ago and we wouldn't be talking about this right now, which is what I would have preferred," Trump said as he entered the United Nations on Wednesday. Trump described Kavanaugh as a "gem" who had been unfairly maligned. The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled its vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for Friday morning at 9:30 a.m.  Allies of Brett Kavanaugh are touting the performance the Supreme Court nominee and his wife gave Monday evening on Fox News as accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior from high school and college continue to threaten his nomination. The unprecedented decision to put a Supreme Court nominee in front of a camera before his confirmation came as the White House and outside groups work to put Kavanaugh in a stronger position ahead of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both high school students, will also testify. President Donald Trump took perhaps his most aggressive stand in defense of Kavanaugh to date on Tuesday, when he cast doubt on the recollections of both the women accusing Kavanaugh and slammed Democrats for playing what he described as a "con game."
