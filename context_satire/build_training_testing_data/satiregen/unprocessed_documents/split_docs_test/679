 Democrats on Capitol Hill have a message for presidential hopefuls John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado, and Steve Bullock, the current governor of Montana: you'd make great senators. Hickenlooper and Bullock have struggled to gain traction in a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates, but as governors, they have already proven they can be elected statewide. As Democrats gear up for a fight for the Senate, many are quick to say they believe Hickenlooper and Bullock would make formidable challengers to Republican senators up for re-election in Colorado and Montana. "I would urge them to think about this moment in our history and what would be best for the country," Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico told CNN of Hickenlooper and Bullock, saying "no doubt about it," when asked if he thinks they would make strong Senate candidates and adding that he believes they would make good senators.  John Hickenlooper, who has struggled to break through the crowded Democratic presidential field, spoke to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer late last week about running for the Senate from Colorado, a race he has resisted joining but is keeping an open mind about, a top aide tells CNN. "He is still in the race for president, but he hasn't closed the door to anything," said Peter Cunningham, the communications director for the former Colorado governor. The latest conversation between Hickenlooper and Schumer took place in New York, following the CNN presidential debates in Detroit. The two have spoken repeatedly about the Senate contest, but Hickenlooper has been insistent on keeping his presidential campaign alive.  The most progressive Democratic presidential contenders showed over two nights in Detroit that they are ready for an ideological clash to define the party -- and former Vice President Joe Biden showed he is ready to give it to them. The first debate night, Tuesday, was all about ideology: Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont spent the night answering to attacks from low-polling moderates like former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.
