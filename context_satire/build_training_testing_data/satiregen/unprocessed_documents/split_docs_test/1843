In the pilot, he moves in with Alison Parker after her roommate moves out in the middle of the night. In the first season he is an aspiring writer and taxi driver. He later works for a newspaper, and later starts working at D&D Advertising with Alison and Amanda. His relationship with Alison starts off platonic. Alison Scott is a career-minded woman who has just been given an on-air role with E! and is living in the pool house with her sister Debbie's family. Ben Stone is laid-back and sardonic. He lives off funds received in compensation for an injury and sporadically works on a celebrity porn website with his roommates, in between smoking marijuana or going to theme parks such as Knott's Berry Farm.  Two years ago, Sam Blakely aborted a pregnancy after she was raped. Now she has a message for Alabama state lawmakers and Gov. Kay Ivey after they passed the most restrictive abortion law in the country -- one that includes no exemptions for victims of incest or rape like herself. "I have absolutely no words to describe the disgust that I feel and so many women have told me that they feel," Blakely told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day" Thursday morning.
