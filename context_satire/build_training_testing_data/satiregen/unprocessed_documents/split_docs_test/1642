Then Carl goes into Eli's house and bids him look up the Book of Changes for something new. In so searching, Eli finds a sign that reads: "And the darkness will come and swallow them all. Unless the family of Light (which he thinks is Melinda and her family) turns night into day." The scene cuts to Melinda talking to Jim about the plumber still working, and Jim says that he has not even seen the plumber, but Melinda thinks he had called him. Melinda sees Carl the Watcher when she is with Aiden, but for his sake, she does not answer him. Then Carl goes to the dentist, where Eli is, and Eli explains why Melinda refuses to talk to him. Then Carl realizes that he was under the control of the Shadows, and that what they made him say to Melinda was really dangerous. Then, in the hospital, Melinda sees ghosts marching around with the boy who had asked Melinda for a drink ahead of them. In the hospital, Melinda mistakes a living person for a ghost. After that. Melinda sees the ghost boy in the hospital, and he says that if Melinda brings his parents to him, then he will cross over. Melinda goes to the gas station where the boy had told her his father was.
