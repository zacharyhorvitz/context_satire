 William Barr, President Donald Trump's pick to be the next attorney general, met Thursday with Senate Democrats who have questioned his nomination over his criticisms of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Barr made private assurances to her that he wouldn't interfere with the Mueller probe. Now she needs to hear them in public. "Well, my intention will be to get that on the record before I'm satisfied," Feinstein told reporters after her meeting with Barr.  Special counsel Robert Mueller's work does not appear to be done yet. Mueller's team and defense attorneys for former Trump campaign official Rick Gates updated the judge presiding over his case Tuesday, and yet again, Mueller is not ready to put his sentencing in motion. Gates "continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations, and accordingly the parties do not believe it is appropriate to commence the sentencing process at this time," attorneys from both Gates' legal team and special counsel's office said in a one-page statement for the judge. The lawyers involved asked for their next update to come in two months.  The congressional testimony of President Donald Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen is already set to be one of the most highly anticipated moments of the new Democratic-controlled House, but those expecting significant public insights into the Russia investigation could be disappointed. Cohen is not expected to answer questions about any topics related to that investigation when he appears before the House Oversight Committee next month because special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is ongoing. He consulted with the special counsel before agreeing to appear at the hearing, two sources told CNN. That doesn't mean Cohen's testimony won't have dramatic reveals.
