The American Trucking Associations (ATA), founded in 1933, is the largest national trade association for the trucking industry. ATA represents more than 37,000 members covering every type of motor carrier in the United States through a federation of other trucking groups, industry-related conferences, and its 50 affiliated state trucking associations. Former Governor of Kansas Bill Graves was replaced by Chris Spear as the ATA's President and CEO in July 2016. In 1987 the PCC disaffiliated with the ATA and renamed itself the "National Private Trucking Association" (NPTA). In 1988 the NPTA and the PTCA voted to merge the two organizations into one. A year later, in 1989, as a result of this merger, the National Private Truck Council was chartered in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Since its inception, NPTC has been an independent national trade association unaffiliated with any other organization in the trucking industry. On September 23, 1933, the American Trucking Associations was established as a national affiliation of state trucking organizations. The ATA was established by a merger of the American Highway Freight Association and the Federated Trucking Associations of America.
