 President Donald Trump likes to boast that he is the most popular Republican president among Republicans that has ever existed. "How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?" he tweeted earlier this month. That may be changing, at least according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll that shows 1 in 3 Republican and Republican-leaning voters would like the GOP to nominate "someone other" than Trump in 2020.  The Washington Post recently reported that Howard Schultz, the former CEO and chairman of Starbucks, is seriously mulling a presidential run as a third-party candidate. That the former coffee executive is considering an afterlife in politics is not new news -- his name has been bandied about on numerous lists of high-profile corporate and celebrity outsiders who might take on Donald Trump in 2020 -- but up until now, much of that speculation assumed that Schultz would run as a Democrat. The history of successful third-party presidential bids in modern American history is the shortest of lists -- with precisely zero entries -- but the "sui generis" dynamics of the 2020 contest could possibly create a once-in-a-generation opening for a Schultz presidential gambit. For this to play out in Schultz's favor, a few factors will have to align -- some of which, as far as Schultz and his advisers are concerned, are completely outside their control. President Carter was challenged by Ted Kennedy for his re-election bid in the Democratic presidential primary. Carter would later write that the ongoing Iran hostage crisis impacted the latter's choice to rely on Rosalynn among others in his administration to advocate for his policies on the campaign trail. Vice President Mondale would come to view himself and Rosalynn as President Carter's proxies through much of the spring portion of the election cycle. Rosalynn would reflect that the Iowa victory of the Carter re-election campaign, which saw President Carter defeat Kennedy 59.16% to 31.23%, made attacks by Kennedy easier for her to not be bothered by.
