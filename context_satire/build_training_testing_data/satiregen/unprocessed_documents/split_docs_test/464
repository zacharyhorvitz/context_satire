 President Donald Trump, while often unpredictable, has been entirely consistent in two ways. First, he loves to claim credit for anything good that happens. And, second, he will not only refuse to accept responsibility for anything that goes wrong, he will blame others for it. And it appears Trump is staying true to form in response to the unfolding Ukraine scandal.  In Washington this week, President Donald Trump had his hands full, trying to climb out of the seemingly endless swirl of negativism that has come on the heels of an ongoing impeachment inquiry. Meanwhile, his wife, the first lady of the United States, spent Thursday and Friday climbing through Big Sky country, enjoying a nature walk with kids in Jackson Hole, and Moose, Wyoming, even, according to a member of her communications team, spotting a bald eagle roosting in a tree alongside a bucolic riverbank. As President Trump back home takes it from all sides -- a barrage of accusations and innuendos about misuse of presidential power, and fires back at Democrats, doubling down on his defense of goading the leaders of Ukraine and China to look into his political opponent, Melania Trump quite literally floated away from it all, downstream, in a raft on Wyoming's Snake River, the still-warm October sun shining on her very first trip to Grand Teton territory. "The trip (to Wyoming) had been in the planning stages for a couple of months," her spokeswoman, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told CNN.  Stop me if you've heard this one: Mitt Romney has emerged as the face of the Republican resistance to President Donald Trump. Unless you've not been paying any attention, literally, to politics over the past four years, you'd have stopped me. Because Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee and now a senator from Utah, has repeatedly spoken out against Trump's most egregious acts and statements -- only to retreat amid a verbal barrage of criticism from the President and his supporters. Romney is at it again following Trump's imploring of Ukraine and China to look into debunked allegations of corruption directed at Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
