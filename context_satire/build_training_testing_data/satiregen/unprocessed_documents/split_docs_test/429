 Republicans are freaking out about Donald Trump, but the candidate himself is insisting his campaign has never been in better shape. Trump took the stage in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Wednesday with his presidential bid apparently floundering. Republican leaders and even senior members of his own team expressed frustration with his political meltdown on Tuesday. The GOP nominee tried to stem the growing panic -- addressing the state of his campaign right at the top of his speech.  The front page of Wednesday's New York Daily News called for Donald Trump to end his presidential campaign -- writing, "This isn't a joke any more." In an editorial posted online Tuesday night, the newspaper called for Trump to end his campaign following comments the candidate made on Tuesday that some saw as a threat of violence toward his rival Hillary Clinton. "Donald Trump must end his campaign for the White House in a reckoning with his own madness, while praying that nothing comes of his musing about an assassination of Hillary Clinton," the paper wrote. Trump said at a campaign stop in North Carolina on Tuesday that "Hillary wants to abolish -- essentially abolish the Second Amendment.  We can't be certain of what Donald Trump exactly intended when he warned his supporters about how a President Hillary Clinton would jettison the right to bear arms and then said: "If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the Second Amendment people — maybe there is, I don't know." Some supporters, as well as some Republican opponents of the nominee, insist he was referring to how gun rights supporters would mobilize politically to defeat her. Some others — on both sides of the aisle — had a different reaction, namely that the Republican presidential candidate was raising the specter of assassination.
