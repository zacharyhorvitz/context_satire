 Former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden said he used "poor judgment" in serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company because it has become a political liability for his father. "I did nothing wrong at all," he said in an interview with ABC News recorded over the weekend at his home in Los Angeles and broadcast Tuesday. "However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is -- it's a swamp, in many ways? Yeah."  Hunter Biden's decision to speak publicly about his seat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company -- and his relationship with his father -- makes clear that he, at least, is concerned that he could be a problem for his father's 2020 presidential campaign. "I did nothing wrong at all," Hunter Biden told ABC News in an interview that ran Tuesday morning. "However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is -- it's a swamp, in many ways? Yeah.  Joe Biden said Sunday that even though he was the last top-tier Democratic candidate to call for President Donald Trump's impeachment, "I'm the reason there is impeachment going on." The former vice president lambasted Trump for asking foreign governments to investigate him and his son Hunter -- despite there being no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of either Biden -- at a forum in Iowa, saying that the President is leading the "most corrupt administration in modern American history." "It's gotten so far now, if you don't move on it, then what do we say to the rest of the world about who we are?" Biden said.
