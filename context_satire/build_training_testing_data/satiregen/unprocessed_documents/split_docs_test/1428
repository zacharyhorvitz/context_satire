In an epilogue of the same book, Frankie was found dead. A young police constable walking his beat accidentally discovered the body of Frankie Brown beneath sheets of newspaper in an alley at the edge of Chelsea, on a freezing November night. The young man's body lay frozen in a foetal position. An autopsy revealed several facts, including: Frankie had died of hypothermia, that he was a long-time drug abuser, and that he had probably not eaten for at least three days. Hags as sovereignty figures abound in Irish mythology. The most common pattern is that the hag represents the barren land, who the hero of the tale must approach without fear, and come to love on her own terms. When the hero displays this courage, love, and acceptance of her hideous side, the sovereignty hag then reveals that she is also a young and beautiful goddess. She is a lonely middle-aged woman who is on the look-out for a man, but is put off by her mother and what her mother usually has to say about her boyfriends. In series one, it is revealed that Cathy has already been married once in a London register office, and the man she married was beating her - she is not divorced as of Series 1. Her past romances include: Teddy Brannigan, the local bad boy; Professor Thomas Clowne, her psychology teacher, and Mick, who is a police officer. It was revealed by Maria Brown that Mick was already married.
