 Mike Huckabee has a counter offer to Jeb Bush's promise to bring the economy back to 4% growth: 6%. "I believe we can get it to 6 or higher with a fair tax. I'm convinced," Huckabee told a crowd of potential caucus-goers at the Iowa State Fair on Thursday. "I guarantee you we will goose the economy if you bring $11 trillion of working capital back to this country." Mike Huckabee is the former Governor of Arkansas (1996â€“2007) and was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States in the 2008 presidential election. He was running for the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election but suspended his campaign on February 1, 2016  Less than 12 hours after stepping off the debate stage in Cleveland, Chris Christie arrived here Friday to make a pitch to 900 conservative activists that he has the mettle to be the next commander-in-chief. His appearance was risky but strategic as the New Jersey governor is not necessarily beloved by this audience -- many of whom question if he is a true conservative. The night before, at the Red State debate watch party, the audience booed Christie several times when he appeared on the large screens in a hotel ballroom. Red State attendees tend to be more politically aligned with the likes of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov.
