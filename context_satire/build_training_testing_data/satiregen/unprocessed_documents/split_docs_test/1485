 On Wednesday's "Daily Show" Jon Stewart addressed, well, himself. The satirical host opened the show with a discussion of his reportedly "secret" White House meetings with President Obama. "It was openly listed, and I went through the normal White House entrance like everybody else, and I told my mom," Stewart said of the meetings. "Something is not a secret just because you don't know about it."  President Barack Obama is back on the campaign trail, skewering several top Republicans at a Monday news conference in Ethiopia, where he dubbed their rhetoric "outrageous" and "sad." At a joint press conference with Ethiopia's prime minister, Obama was asked about comments made by former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee who accused the U.S. President of marching Israelis "to the door of the oven" with his nuclear deal with Iran. "The particular comments of Mr. Huckabee are I think part of just a general pattern that we've seen that is, would be, considered ridiculous if it weren't so sad," Obama said Monday, while defending his administration's rollout of the Iran nuclear deal. Obama has repeatedly said he's run his last campaign, which made the response all the more notable.  President Barack Obama's half-sister is amazed at how well her brother sang "Amazing Grace" last month, while eulogizing one of the victims of the Charleston, South Carolina church-shooting. "I'm surprised he sang so well," Auma Obama told CNN's Brooke Baldwin Wednesday during an exclusive interview ahead of Obama's visit to Kenya as president. Auma, who first met Obama when they were in their 20s, laughed and said "He was amazing." Obama's Charleston eulogy: 'Amazing Grace' As Obama nears the end of his presidency, Auma said that she was proud of the mark he had name for the "Obama" name in the world.
