 Polls show Mitt Romney trailing President Barack Obama in just about every one of the swing states where the 2012 campaign is being waged. But Romney appears to be in deeper trouble in Ohio than elsewhere, an alarming development for Republicans who know that the candidate's White House chances begin and end with the kind of middle-class voters who reside in places such as Akron, Cincinnati and Zanesville. So why exactly is Romney trailing? Two surveys released in recent days, one from the Ohio Newspaper Association and another from The Washington Post, crystallized the challenge facing Romney as he embarks on his second straight day of campaigning in the Buckeye State.  President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney went head-to-head on China, taxes, and jobs on Wednesday as the two campaigned throughout Ohio. Both sought to illustrate what the next four years would be like under their leadership as new polls indicated Obama exceeding 50% support among  likely voters in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania. Those are all swing states that combined will account for nearly a quarter of the electoral votes needed to win the White House. Surveys suggest that Romney has lost his edge on the economy, the centerpiece of his campaign to highlight slow growth, trade tensions, and stubbornly high unemployment under Obama's leadership.  With Mitt Romney beginning to tighten the gap between President Obama and himself in the latest CNN polls, Governor Ted Strickland (D-OH) joins “Starting Point” to discuss the upcoming presidential debate. Strickland argues that the Obama campaign in Ohio is the “strongest” he’s “ever seen” with an extensive grassroots effort. “You don't count your chickens before they hatch and we're not going to do that,” Strickland says. “But we're voting in Ohio beginning today and people stayed up all night, camped out all night here in Ohio, waiting to be able to cast their votes this morning.”  Strickland also argues that despite the high unemployment rate, Obama is able to remain a slight lead in the polls because many Americans have “started to see” success “in the Midwest” and “in manufacturing states.” “Things are improving in America and we ought not to just turn around and go back to the same failed policies that brought on this recession in the first place,” Strickland says.
