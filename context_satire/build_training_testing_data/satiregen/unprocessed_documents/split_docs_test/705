 Office Depot announced a deal to merge with smaller rival OfficeMax in an all-stock deal worth about $1.2 billion. Details on the deal were limited. The companies said they expect to save $400 million to $600 million annually from the combination. But there were no estimates of staffing cuts or store closings.  Shares of rival office supply chains Office Depot and OfficeMax soared in early trading Tuesday following widespread reports that the two companies are in merger talks. OfficeMax shares rallied 30%, while shares of Office Depot, the larger of the two, surged 24%. Office Depot has 1,262 stores worldwide, 39,000 employees, and 2011 sales of $11.5 billion, the last full year for which it has reported results. Office Max has 978 stores, 29,000 employees and 2011 sales of $7.1 billion. During its tenth anniversary in 1996, Staples became a member of the Fortune 500 companies as sales surpassed $3Â billion. On September 4, 1996, Staples and Office Depot announced plans to merge. The Federal Trade Commission decided that the merged company would unfairly increase office supply prices despite competition from OfficeMax, because OfficeMax did not have stores in many of the local markets that the merger would affect. Staples argued that chains such as Walmart and Circuit City represented significant competition, but this argument did little to sway the FTC.
