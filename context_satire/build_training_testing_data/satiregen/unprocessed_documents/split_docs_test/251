Olivia Colasanto, portrayed by Nana Visitor, is the granddaughter of Angelo Colasanto, who first appears in the episode "Immortal Sins". Olivia is involved in the plot to kidnap Gwen Cooper's family to force her to hand over Captain Jack Harkness. Upon Rex Matheson and Esther Drummond foiling her appropriation of Jack, and Sergeant Davidson rescuing Gwen's family, Olivia reveals her trump card - that Jack will still come with her as she can bring him to Angelo and thus enlighten him to how the Miracle started. Episode eight, "End of the Road" begins with Olivia bringing Jack and his Torchwood associates to the Colorado mansion where she lives with her grandfather Angelo, now a decrepit old man in a semi-vegetative state. Nikki Bevan, played by Ruth Jones, appears in Adrift as the single mother of a missing teenager, Jonah Bevan. During the police investigation she is befriended by Andy, who takes a personal interest in the case and refers Jonah's disappearance to Gwen Cooper. Unable to let her son go, Nikki spends her time obsessively looking through VHS tapes of crowd footage at major events trying to see her son. She sets up a self-help group called Searchlight for families of lost people in Cardiff, which alerts Gwen to the fact that the disappearances are widespread. American actor Teddy Sears played a representative of Torchwood's enemies, the Three Families, credited only as Blue-eyed man. He first appears in "The Categories of Life" where he informs Jilly Kitzinger that her work with Phicorp and Oswald Danes has got her noticed by the right people. After Danes and Kitzinger part company in "End of the Road", the blue-eyed man reappears and informs Kitzinger that her intern is a traitor and shoots her dead. He then offers Kitzinger a promotion working with The Families at a level beyond Phicorp.
