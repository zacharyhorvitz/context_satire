In the office, Detective Reese continues to watch the video from Rachel's camera, here he notices glitches in the video. While Burquez is speaking at the conference, the reporters begin receiving messages and Burquez is told of a new development. Reese realizes that the videos have been edited for the police to view, with the edits being released to the media. The video now shows Rachel and Leann carefully planning the massacre and framing Tyler for everything. Katrina, looking in the camera,  begins talking about how the police will be scrambling over the scene to find out what is happening. She makes a dying request to be with the one she loves, Gerry Fleishman, her husband, and asks to be buried in the plot next to his. She goes over some of her husband's mental and physical disabilities after he came back from war, about celebrities being famous for no reason, and she speaks of God; the camera then stalls and flickers to a new image of the killer, we watch as Katrina's neck is sliced and she is killed while her camera records.  Emojis might just be the political cartoon for the Snapchat generation. That's the thinking behind a new iOS emoji keyboard called Hillarymoji. The keyboard hit the Apple store on Thursday with 20 Hillary Clinton-related stickers. It features emojis like Clinton sporting a T-shirt that reads, "The future is female," Clinton channeling "Rosie the Riveter," and a pink credit card that reads "Woman Card" in a nod to Donald Trump's now infamous phrase.
