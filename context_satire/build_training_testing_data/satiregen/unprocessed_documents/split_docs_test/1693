In June 2018, The Boston Globe reported 467 current and former Massachusetts Department of Transportation employees were using the E-ZPass transponders for free. This employee benefit that has been going on since at least 2009 costs the Massachusetts taxpayers approximately $1 million dollars per year. It is not clear if MassDOT has paid taxes on the benefit or reported it to the Internal Revenue Service, or who would be responsible if a payment to the IRS is required.  President Donald Trump will look to reinvigorate his stalled push for a sweeping infrastructure bill Tuesday when he meets with some of his top aides in New York to discuss the plan. Trump's attempts to pass an infrastructure reform plan have been largely left on the back burner on Capitol Hill, where issues like health care, tax reform and confirmations have taken precedence. Trump, according to a White House official, will "receive an update from his infrastructure team" and sign an executive order that he hopes will "bringing accountability and discipline" into the process for permitting infrastructure projects. Trump campaigned on a pledge to remake the way the federal government handles infrastructure projects, casting himself as a real estate developer who knows what it takes to get a building project done. The Line 2 East Extension Project, is the currently under-construction eastward extension of Line 2, which adds 4-kilometer (2.5Â mi) of new line, starting from the eastern terminus of Santolan Station in Marikinaup to Masinag in Antipolo. The project aims to accommodate an additional 80,000 passengers and reduce traffic congestion along Marcos Highway. When the project is completed, it will reduce travel time from Recto to Masinag from 3 hours to only 40 minutes. It is scheduled to be finished by 2019
