 The day after a marathon three-hour meeting of 11 top tier candidates, here's our take on the winners and losers of CNN's Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Winners: Carly Fiorina Fiorina insisted in the lead-up to the GOP debate that she belonged on the debate stage with the top-tier White House hopefuls. She proved as much Wednesday night. For the second debate in a row, Fiorina was once again the breakout star of the night, taking on Republican front-runner Donald Trump with finesse and capturing the crowd with polished, zinging answers and an impassioned charge against abortion.  In the first half of the CNN Republican debate Wednesday, Donald Trump succeeded in his basic campaign strategy: make the entire contest about him. When most people were watching, Trump was continually a focal point of the discussion. Early on he launched a series of ad hominem attacks, like telling Rand Paul he shouldn't even be on the stage and making quips about his looks. This has been his strategy since entering the race -- constantly attack and constantly be attacked.  No one has more on the line in Wednesday night's Republican presidential debate than Jeb Bush. The former Florida governor with one of the most recognizable names in politics and $100 million in the bank is facing one of the most crucial moments of his political career at the CNN debate held at the Reagan Library. In the unpredictable GOP race for president, Bush is struggling to regain his footing in the midst of Hurricane Trump. He first tried to ignore the bellicose billionaire before changing course and punching back hard.
