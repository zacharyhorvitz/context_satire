 Thanksgiving is looking up for Natalie Dubose, the Ferguson entrepreneur whose bakery was trashed by rowdy protesters overnight Monday. Dubose owns Natalie's Cakes and More, and has raised more than $84,000 since creating a crowdfunding page Tuesday afternoon to rebuild her business. "I am just so grateful for all the love and support that's been showed to me," she told CNNMoney after learning that another $30,000 had been added to the site since the last time she checked. (She was too busy baking to monitor it.)  President Obama celebrated his favorite holiday -- Thanksgiving -- with phone calls to U.S. troops, something he often does to mark the holiday. He spoke with representatives from the Army, Air Force, Marines, Navy and Coast Guard to express his appreciation for their service, including their work to stamp out Ebola and to defeat ISIS. The First Family, joined by other family members, was set to feast on a dinner of thyme-roasted turkey, honey-baked ham, cornbread stuffing, oyster stuffing, braised winter greens, sweet potato gratin, mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, dinner rolls and macaroni and cheese. Mac and Cheese also happened to be the names of the two 20-week old, 48-pound turkeys the president pardoned on Wednesday as part of the 67th anniversary of the National Thanksgiving Turkey.  As we all know, Thanksgiving isn't always the harmonious holiday it's sometimes made out to be. Stick a bunch of relatives together in the same house, add menu planning and alcohol, and things can get a little snippy. Many people have strong opinions about how to cook the turkey, what side dishes to serve and who has to clean up. Family traditions die hard and new ideas aren't always welcome.
