 Sen. Cory Booker has promised to run a relentlessly positive and unifying campaign, preaching love as an antidote to the nation's ills during his first trip to Iowa as a presidential candidate this weekend. It's a message that sets him apart in a large and growing Democratic field: Booker isn't the only candidate talking about bringing a polarized nation together, but some of his rivals have tried to channel their party's anger at President Donald Trump. Whether Democratic voters think a candidate wrapped in a message of love has the mettle to beat Trump might be one the fundamental questions around Booker's campaign. As Booker conceded himself following his campaign launch, "Love ain't easy."  There's no indication that Americans like Howard Schultz two weeks into the rollout of his possible independent run for president; he had the worst numbers of any potential candidate tested, only one-in-five said they were likely to support him if he were to run in 2020, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released Wednesday. Schultz falls behind Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown (21% likely to support), New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (22%), and the other billionaire businessman thinking about running -- former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (27%), who built a media company that bears his name and now might run for president as a Democrat. Schultz was tied with Bloomberg for those who said they were "not likely at all" to support the two candidates. They follow the more than half of Americans who said they were "not likely at all" to support President Donald Trump, according to the poll.  This weekend was a busy one on the 2020 campaign trail, with two more Democrats -- Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren -- joining the race officially. There are nowÂ seven main Democrats running for the party nod, with at least twice that number either officially or unofficially exploring a bid. With so many candidates getting in the race, it's worth looking at who did it best. (Nota bene: Campaign announcements don't make or break a campaign.
