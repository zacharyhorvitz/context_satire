For most of its history, Nebraska has been a solidly Republican state. Republicans have carried the state in all but one presidential election since 1940: the 1964 landslide election of Lyndon B. Johnson. In the 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush won the state's five electoral votes by a margin of 33 percentage points (making Nebraska's the fourth-strongest Republican vote among states) with 65.9% of the overall vote; only Thurston County, which is majority-Native American, voted for his Democratic challenger John Kerry. In 2008, the state split its electoral votes for the first time: Republican John McCain won the popular vote in Nebraska as a whole and two of its three congressional districts; the second district, which includes the city of Omaha, went for Democrat Barack Obama. Romero has three brothers. Her mother was an educator and her father was a businessman. Her parents encouraged Romero and her siblings to be socially conscious and to be able to express their thoughts. As a result, her home was a home where  “conversations about poverty, the death penalty, the prevalence of homelessness, presidential elections and warfare were commonplace, as were talks about the importance of community and charity”. Romero, who is of Mexican American descent, has an interest in the Mexico-United States border. She has some experience with the border, as someone who had to go through a border checkpoint to visit her grandparents in San Diego, California  Romero decided to write a trilogy that looks at the Mexican/Arizona border issues. Two plays from the trilogy are Wetback and Mother of Exiles. With the help of a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts, the Arizona Theatre Company was able to commission Romero to write the last play of her trilogy, as well as give the playwright the opportunity to lead a project called Voices of a New America.
