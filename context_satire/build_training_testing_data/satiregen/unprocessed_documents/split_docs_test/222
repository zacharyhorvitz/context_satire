In an August 2019 interview with The Washington Post, Donald Trump opened up about his relationship with his late brother and expressed regret over how he treated Fred Jr. and his struggle with alcoholism. Trump said Freddy's memory still shapes his life to this day, and had a huge impact on the trajectory of his own business career and life. In the interview Donald Trump said, "He was so handsome, and I saw what alcohol did to him even physically ... and that had an impact on me, too." Taylor testified that the day after the Trump–Zelensky phone call, one of his aides, David Holmes, overheard Sondland speaking to Trump via cellphone in a Kyiv restaurant, hearing the president refer to "the investigations". Another diplomat, Suriya Jayanti, also overheard the call. Holmes testified behind closed doors on November 15 that he heard Trump ask, "so, he's gonna do the investigation?" to which Sondland replied, "he's gonna do it", adding that Zelensky would do "anything you ask him to". On November 15, David Holmes, a U.S. Department of State foreign service officer who works at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, and serves as an aide to Bill Taylor, testified in a closed-door session before three House committees that he and two unnamed aides overheard a phone conversation between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump, while at a restaurant in Kyiv, and immediately following a private meeting between President Zelensky and Sondland, where Trump asked Sondland about whether or not the Ukrainian President had agreed to investigate the Bidens. Holmes' statement provided the first testimony under oath that Trump directly and contemporaneously requested investigations of Joe and Hunter Biden and Burisma, with Trump allegedly asking "so he's gonna do the investigation? ", refuting the potential defense that Trump had not been involved, and that Sondland might have been acting without the president's knowledge. Further, Holmes' deposition raised questions about the credibility, accuracy, and truthfulness of Ambassador Sondland's previous sworn deposition, furthering the possibility that Sondland either perjured himself or needed to clarify his original sworn statement.
