 The past week has been a devastating one for many families. Zubeidat Tsarnaev's is one of them. But the mother of the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings remains resolute in her belief that her sons were not involved in the attack. She told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh in Makhachkala, Dagestan, that she believes the tragedy that killed three people and injured dozens more was staged and that the bombing was fake.  The FBI has flatly rejected an assertion by the mother of the two suspected Boston bombers that the bureau had been tracking her oldest son and had spoken with him last week after the deadly marathon bombing. The chief spokesman for the FBI, Mike Kortan, said he continues to stand by an FBI  statement issued Friday that said that the only communication the FBI ever had with Tamerlan Tsarnaev was an interview agents conducted with him in 2011 at the urging of a foreign government, since identified as Russia. Did one brother brainwash the other? Zubeidat Tsarnaev, the mother of the suspected bombers, told reporters the FBI had tracked her oldest son for as long as five years.  The body of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev lies unclaimed in a state morgue. Authorities had not yet determined a cause of death on Wednesday, and no one had stepped forward to claim the body, said Terrel Harris, a spokesman for the Massachusetts state medical examiner. The suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, said she wanted her son to be buried near a Cambridge mosque and told CNN earlier in the week that family members had arranged for a funeral on Tuesday or Wednesday. But the Islamic Society of Boston said Wednesday that the family had not contacted local mosque officials with any funeral requests.
