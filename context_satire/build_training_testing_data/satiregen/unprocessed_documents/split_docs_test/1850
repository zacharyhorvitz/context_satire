 Justice John Paul Stevens, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by Republican President Gerald Ford in 1975 in the wake of Watergate and stepped down almost 35 years later as a leader for the liberal side of the bench, has died. He was 99. Stevens, known as a soft spoken midwesterner with a searing intellect, died on Tuesday of complications following a stroke he suffered on July 15, according to a statement from the Supreme Court. He passed away peacefully at Holy Cross Hospital in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, with his daughters by his side, the court said.  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg revealed Tuesday that she traveled with retired Justice John Paul Stevens "in the last week of his life" to Lisbon, Portugal, for a conference where the two justices attended meetings, visited museums, vineyards and castles. "Perhaps he knew at age 99, distant travel was a risk," Ginsburg said during Stevens' funeral at Arlington National Cemetery, "but he wanted to experience fully the joys of being alive, and he did just that almost to the end." Ginsburg, 86, said that as the "next eldest in attendance" she had the opportunity to ride with him on long drives and his mind "remained vibrant" and he spoke not only of court cases but footnotes in various opinions. "His conversation was engaging, his memory amazing," she said.  As Justice John Paul Stevens returns to the Supreme Court for the final time to lie in repose, he will be accompanied by about 80 of his former clerks, 12 of whom will serve as honorary pallbearers as others line the steps of the marble building as his casket arrives. Once inside, the clerks are expected to rotate "standing vigil" over the casket while well-wishers pay their respects. Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy participated in a brief ceremony in the great hall Monday morning. Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Stephen Breyer and Clarence Thomas all had long-standing commitments, according to the court's public information officer.
