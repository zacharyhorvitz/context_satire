Zsa Zsa's only child, Francesca Hilton, was born on 10 March 1947, by then-husband Conrad Hilton. Zsa Zsa was the only Gabor sister to have a child. Francesca Hilton died on 5 January 2015, at the age of 67, from an apparent stroke or heart attack. She had no children. During her stint on EastEnders: E20, Zsa Zsa was called an "impressive" character by Tony Stewart of the Daily Mirror. A writer for The Northern Echo wondered if Zsa Zsa, along with Leon and Fatboy, brought a new injection of life into EastEnders or took away screen time from more established characters, Zsa Zsa was featured in Inside Soap's "Next Big Thing" feature in 2010, where they name the new stars of British soaps that they believe "will set the world of soap alight in the year ahead" but after her departure they branded her one of 2010's departed characters that would not be remembered. In May 2010, Kenny received a nomination in the "Best Soap Newcomer" category at the 14th TVChoice Awards for her portrayal of Zsa Zsa. On June 1, 2005, her stepfather, Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt, filed suit against her in a California court and accused her of fraud. The court threw out the case for lack of evidence. Hilton denied the allegations. Hilton lived in West Hollywood apartments for the last nine years of her life.
