 Stephen Colbert has gotten animated about President Donald Trump on "The Late Show," and now Colbert is bringing an animated Trump to Showtime. Colbert will executive produce a new half-hour animated series about Trump and "the most powerful family in the world," according to the network. The series, which is currently untitled, will premiere this fall on the premium cable network, which has ordered ten episodes. The animated show will "present the truish adventures of Trump's confidants and bon vivants -- family, top associates, heads of government, golf pros and anyone else straying into his orbit -- intrepidly exploring their histories and their psyches, revealing insights into what makes them so definitively Trumpian," according to the network. The impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, the incumbent president of the United States, was initiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on September 24, 2019, after a whistleblower alleged that Donald Trump may have abused the power of the presidency. Trump is accused of withholding military aid as a means of pressuring newly elected president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky to pursue investigations of Joe Biden and his son Hunter and to investigate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind interference in the 2016 presidential election. More than a week after Trump had put a hold on the previously approved aid, he made these requests in a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president, which the whistleblower said was intended to help Trump's reelection bid.  President Donald Trump welcomed Sen. John McCain back to Washington with a Tuesday morning tweet calling the Arizona Republican an "American hero." "So great that John McCain is coming back to vote. Brave - American hero! Thank you John," Trump wrote.
