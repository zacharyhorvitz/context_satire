 President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the possibility of meeting at the White House during a phone call last month, the White House confirmed on Monday. "As the President himself confirmed on March 20, hours after his last call with President Putin, the two had discussed a bilateral meeting in the 'not-too-distant future' at a number of potential venues, including the White House," White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said in a statement. Shah's comment came after Yuri Ushakov, an aide to Putin, said Trump "offered to hold the first meeting in Washington, in the White House." "If everything goes well, I hope that the Americans will not give up their proposal to discuss the possibility of holding the summit.  For the second year in a row, President Trump is snubbing an annual celebration of the White House press corps. The president said in a radio interview that he is "probably" skipping the White House Correspondents' Association's annual dinner. Then the association said it had been told by the White House that he will not be coming. "The White House has informed us that the president does not plan to participate in this year's dinner but that he will actively encourage members of the executive branch to attend and join us as we celebrate the First Amendment," the group's president, Margaret Talev, said Friday morning.  The author of a new book on the current state of affairs in the White House claims that Kellyanne Conway is the "number one leaker" in President Donald Trump's White House. In a Sunday interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union," Ronald Kessler, the author of "The Trump White House: Changing the Rules of the Game," claimed that the President's counselor and former campaign manager leaks more information to the press than any other individual working in the White House. Kessler told Tapper that in at least one interview with Conway, she forgot that they were on-the-record as she ripped into her fellow colleagues. According to Kessler, Conway said some of the most "mean, cutting and honestly untrue" things about former chief of staff Reince Priebus, and also "dissed" Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the President's senior advisor and son-in-law.
