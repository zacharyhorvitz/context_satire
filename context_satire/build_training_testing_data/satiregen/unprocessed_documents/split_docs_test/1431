There are two ways that a user can view Facebook Stories. First by scrolling to the top of the feed, the users are able to view your friends' Stories and create a story. Second, swipe right from any screen on the Facebook app. Users can't "like" Stories, but can reply to them. In September 2011, Facebook introduced "Timeline" at its developer conference, intended to revamp users' profiles in order to show content based on year, month and date. "Cover" photos were introduced, taking up a significant portion of the top of pages, and a redesigned display of personal information such as friends, likes and photos appeared on the left-hand side, while story posts appeared on the right. The new design introduced flexible sizing for story posts in the feed, along with more prominent location and photo placement. The Timeline also encouraged scrolling, with constantly loading story posts of users' pasts.  Facebook is wishing some of its "Jewish" users a Happy New Year. Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, began Wednesday evening -- and some Facebook users received a celebratory message when they logged in. "Happy New Year! All of us at Facebook wish you a sweet and happy new year."
