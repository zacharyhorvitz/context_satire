 President Donald Trump spent hours isolated in the third-floor residence of the White House for two straight mornings this week, agonizing over developments in the Russia investigation, as aides scrambled to reschedule some briefings to prepare him for the most complicated foreign trip of his presidency. Whether the 12-day journey to Asia offers a welcome diversion -- or whether his preoccupation with Russia becomes a dangerous distraction -- is a question that will be answered along the way as he leaves Washington on Friday. The President's aides have spent months preparing an agenda that will keep Trump engaged and upbeat, people familiar with the planning of the trip said. With this week's indictments of two former campaign aides and the announcement of a guilty plea from another, advisers now hope the bustling diplomatic swing will prevent Trump from further stewing over the Russia inquiry.  President Donald Trump will not visit the DMZ, a senior administration official announced Tuesday during a briefing from the White House podium. Last Monday, the White House first signaled Trump would most likely forgo a visit to the heavily fortified border between North and South Korea when he visits Asia next month, bypassing what has been a symbolic opportunity for US commanders in chief to stare into the Hermit Kingdom. "The President is not going to visit the DMZ," the official said, explaining that "there is not enough time in the schedule" and that visiting the DMZ has become "a little bit of a clich√©." The official said the White House had to pick between a visit to the DMZ or a visit to Camp Humphreys, a joint US-South Korean military base, which South Korean President Moon Jae-in invited Trump to visit.  The White House stood by President Donald Trump's previous comments when asked Friday whether the more than a dozen women who have accused him of sexual assault were liars. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders offered a very short answer when asked if the White House thought the women were liars. "We've been clear on that in the beginning, and the President's spoken on that," she said. The question came amid revelations in the media and entertainment industries and the realm of politics of stories of women coming forward to share encounters of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace.
