Sarah Elizabeth Sanders (née Huckabee; born August 13, 1982) is an American campaign manager and political adviser who was the White House press secretary under President Donald Trump. Sanders is the third woman to fill the position.With the release of the Mueller Report in April 2019, it is claimed that Sanders admitted to investigators that she had made false statements to the public as press secretary.On June 13, 2019, President Trump tweeted that Sanders would be leaving her role as press secretary for his administration at the end of the month. After Donald Trump was elected, Sanders was named to the position of deputy White House press secretary in his new administration. On May 5, 2017, she held her first White House press briefing, standing in for Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who was serving on Naval Reserve duty. She continued to cover for Spicer until his return to the podium on May 12. She stood in for Spicer during the dismissal of James Comey and the controversy following it. In August 2017, Sanders said President Trump "certainly didn’t dictate" a statement released by Donald Trump Jr. regarding the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians. Sanders also said that President Trump "weighed in, offered suggestion like any father would do." In January 2018, President Trump's lawyers wrote to the special counsel investigation that "the President dictated" the statement released by Donald Trump Jr. In June 2018, Sanders was asked by the media to explain the discrepancy in the statements, but she repeatedly refused to answer the question, saying: "I’m not going to respond to a letter from the president’s outside counsel ... We’ve purposefully walled off, and I would refer you to them for comment", as well as: "I'm an honest person".
