 Attorney General William Barr is expected to release special counsel Robert Mueller's redacted report on the Russia investigation to Congress and the public on Thursday morning, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. The plan to release the redacted report on Thursday means that all of Washington will be on edge this week anticipating the nearly 400-page report from the special counsel.

Last month, Barr released a four-page summary of Mueller's principal conclusions, which stated that Mueller's investigation did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump's team and the Russian government, and Mueller did not reach a conclusion on obstruction of justice, though Barr wrote the investigation did not exonerate Trump.  Attorney General William Barr said Tuesday he expects to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report "within a week," but he does not plan to provide Congress with an unredacted version of the report, setting the stage for a showdown with congressional Democrats. Barr told a House subcommittee Tuesday that the redactions process was going "very well," and he would use color-coded categories and explain the rationale for the redactions that are made from Mueller's nearly 400-page report. But he said he would not accede to Democrats' demands that he provide the full, unredacted report to Congress, arguing that he cannot legally release grand jury material and that he did not plan to ask a court to release it. "I don't intend at this stage to send the full, unredacted report to the committee," Barr said.  House Democrats are prepping a swift response to Attorney General William Barr's plans to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report within the next week, after Barr's first public comments Tuesday did little to quell the Democratic anger over Barr's rollout of the special counsel probe. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler is preparing to "very quickly" subpoena the Justice Department and go to court seeking to obtain grand jury information, while House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff says he's made a formal request to obtain the counterintelligence information from Mueller's investigation to learn whether the President is "compromised" in any way. "I think that's a betrayal to what he promised during his confirmation," Schiff told CNN, referring to Barr's refusal so far to not provide Congress with the full report and underlying evidence. "But it's what he was hired to do, which is to protect the President.
