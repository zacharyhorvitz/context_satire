 Paris prosecutors are investigating if an electrical short-circuit caused the fire that ripped through Notre Dame Cathedral. A judicial source told CNN on Thursday that "we are not excluding any hypothesis at this stage," saying that this is not their only line of inquiry. Since Tuesday, Paris prosecutors have been investigating what could have turned the Gothic masterpiece into an inferno. At least 40 employees at the Paris landmark have been questioned so far.  France's Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has announced an international architects' competition to rebuild, and perhaps refashion, the fallen spire of Notre Dame cathedral. The spire, which was added during a 19th-century renovation of the 850-year-old Paris cathedral, collapsed early into the fire that engulfed the medieval landmark on Monday evening. It was nearly 300 feet tall, with a structure made of wood and lead. Speaking after a cabinet meeting held by President Emmanuel Macron on reconstruction plans, Philippe said that the competition "will allow us to ask the question of whether we should even recreate the spire as it was conceived by  Viollet-le-Duc," reported Reuters.  As flames ripped through the roof and into the spire of the Cathedral of Notre Dame on Monday night, French President Emmanuel Macron addressed his citizens. Looking distraught, he said: "Notre Dame is our history, it's our literature, it's our imagery. It's the place where we live our greatest moments, from wars to pandemics to liberations ... I'm telling you all tonight -- we will rebuild this cathedral together.
