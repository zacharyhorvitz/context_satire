McKean stated that with Gilligan and Gould's approach, that they are generally told at the start of the season what they would like to see the characters go, but only in two or three episodes before filming, having firmer ideas about specific actions, but that he trusts the showrunners were doing the right thing with the character. McKean spoke of when he got his "death call" from Gilligan and Gould, letting him known that Chuck would die in the third season finale "Lantern", around the time of filming of the seventh episode "Expenses". McKean had expected the call based on the character's arc, and had no regrets or issues with it, since "that Chuck did not belong in Jimmyâ€™s universe by the time he becomes Saul Goodman, so I knew that it was very possible". Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould began planning a television spinoff of Breaking Bad as early as 2009. While filming "Full Measure", Gilligan asked Bob Odenkirk, the actor of series character Saul Goodman, what he thought of a spinoff of the show. In July 2012 Gilligan hinted at a possible Goodman spinoff, stating that he liked "the idea of a lawyer show in which the main lawyer will do anything it takes to stay out of a court of law", including settling on the courthouse steps. During his appearance on Talking Bad, Odenkirk noted that Saul was one of the most popular characters on the show, speculating that the audience likes the character because he is the program's least hypocritical figure, and is good at his job. Like its predecessor, Better Call Saul is set and filmed primarily in and around Albuquerque, New Mexico. Notable locations include the Twisters restaurant used previously in Breaking Bad for Gus's Los Pollos Hermanos, a parking lot kiosk at the Albuquerque Convention Center for where Mike worked in the first few seasons, the Old Bernalillo County Courthouse as the local courthouse, and two nearby office buildings in the North Valley, include Northrop Grumman's, that collectively are used for the HHM office spaces. Jimmy's back office is located in an actual nail salon, which the producers worked with the owners to accommodate, while the Salamanca's restaurant is also a real business in the South Valley that production modified a bit for the show, but otherwise remained an open business outside of filming. The scenes set in Omaha are actually filmed at Cottonwood Mall in Albuquerque; production worked with Cinnabon to bring in the period-specific equipment and service items for the segments, and the extras in the store during these scenes are Cinnabon employees.
