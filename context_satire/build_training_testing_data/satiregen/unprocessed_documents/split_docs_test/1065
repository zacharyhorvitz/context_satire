On day three, Lucy DeCoutere testified, telling the court of a date with Ghomeshi in July 2003. She alleged that "he slapped her without warning and choked her until she couldn't breathe". During cross-examination, Henein presented court with a series of emails written by DeCoutere in the hours following the alleged assault to years later, including an email written hours after the alleged assault which read "You kicked my ass last night and that makes me want to fuck your brains out", a handwritten letter that said "I love your hands", and a photo of her "fellating" a beer bottle in October 2005. DeCoutere said that she was trying to please and placate Ghomeshi because she blamed herself for the crimes  and that none of that changed the fact that she was assaulted. The band members decided to keep publicity down during the recording of their fourth album, as the group was taken aback by such press surrounding Infinity on High. Sessions proved to be difficult for the band; Stump called the making of the album "painful", noting that he and Wentz quarreled over many issues, revealing "I threw something across the room over a major-to-minor progression." On previous albums, Trohman felt he and Hurley did not have enough musical freedom and that Stump and Wentz exerted too much control over the group: "I felt, 'Man, this isn't my band anymore.' It's no one's fault, and I don't want to make it seem that way. The album received positive reviews one writing that "Starting a new project unencumbered by the Drones’ name or weighty reputation seems to have given Liddiard the freedom to jettison the last remaining trappings of rock traditionalism in his songwriting and let loose, with impressive results." The Quietus ranked it #8 out of 100 entries on their list of "Albums of the Year So Far 2018", writing that it's "hot with anger and full of ugly truths about the ways we live our livesthe effect is compelling." Greil Marcus wrote that the album makes "as fierce a band as" The Drones "seem austere" in comparison, writing that "the explosions in "Two Afternoons," "A Laughing Death," and "Rubber Bullies" are glorious and frightening, so big they don’t feel quite real, but there’s a story trying to climb out of the noise, carried by Liddiard's weariness, his uncynical fatalism, but shaped by the counter-vocals of Kitschin and Dunn", ending by saying that "you can feel as if this is what history sounds like as it's being written." As of January 2019, it is also the highest ranked punk blues album of the decade on the website Rate Your Music, based on over 3500 ratings.
