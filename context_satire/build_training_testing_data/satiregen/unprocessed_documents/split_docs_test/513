 One of President-elect Donald Trump's top congressional liaisons is making the jump to K Street instead of joining the Trump administration. Scott Mason, who worked as the Trump campaign's director of congressional relations for the House of Representatives, is joining the top government affairs firm Holland & Knight later this month, a source familiar with the move told CNN on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for Holland & Knight confirmed the hire. Mason will take on a role as senior policy adviser in the firm's public policy and regulatory practice division, where he will help the firm navigate the waters of dealing with the Trump administration. After President Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice: "But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got." The White House Office is an entity within the Executive Office of the President of the United States. The White House Office is headed by the White House chief of staff, who is also the head of the Executive Office of the President. The staff of the various offices are based in the West Wing and East Wing of the White House, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, and the New Executive Office Building. Almost all of the White House Office staff are political appointees of the president.
