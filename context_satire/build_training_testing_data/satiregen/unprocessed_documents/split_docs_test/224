 British police entered the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on Thursday, forcibly removing the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on a US extradition warrant and bringing his seven-year stint there to a dramatic close. Video showed a heavily bearded Assange shouting and gesticulating as multiple officers hustled him into a waiting police van. He was arrested on charges that he skipped bail in the UK in 2012 and at the request of US authorities, London's Metropolitan police said. Officers moved in after Ecuador withdrew his asylum and invited authorities into the embassy, citing Assange's bad behavior.  Once upon a time the ethical debates around journalism were comparatively simple -- beginning with the most basic question of all: Who is a journalist? But here in 2019, nothing about Julian Assange is simple. Looking like a befuddled Old Testament prophet, the WikiLeaks founder was dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London on Thursday to a new form of captivity -- and to challenge journalists around the world as to whether he is a hero deserving their support, or a villain for whom few would weep tears if he spent the rest of his life in a jail cell. Why the polarized differences?  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been charged with helping the former Army intelligence specialist Chelsea Manning access Defense Department computers in 2010 in an effort to disclose secret government documents, the US Justice Department announced Thursday morning, hours after Assange was forcibly removed by authorities from the Ecuadoran embassy in London. More than a year ago, a federal grand jury indicted Assange for one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. The case had been kept under seal until Thursday, and its unveiling marks a new chapter in the US government's high-profile efforts to discourage classified document leaks and to pursue Assange. It's not clear yet whether or how Assange's claims as a journalist under the First Amendment, which his organization, supporters and lawyers have pushed, will factor into this case.
