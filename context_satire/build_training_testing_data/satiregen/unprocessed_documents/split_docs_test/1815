According to The New York Times, the change was made in the hopes that MSNBC can win a wider audience than it did with Schultz. Hayes was said to transition better to The Rachel Maddow Show because he is seen as just as policy-oriented as Maddow. "Chris has done an amazing job creating a franchise on weekend mornings," said Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC. "He's an extraordinary talent and has made a strong connection with our audience." Olbermann began to push for Maddow to get her own show at MSNBC, and he was eventually able to persuade Phil Griffin to give her Dan Abrams's time slot.  Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal is "improving rapidly" and is "no longer in a critical condition" following a nerve agent attack in Salisbury last month, the hospital treating him said in a statement on Friday. Christine Blanshard, medical director at Salisbury District Hospital, said Skripal, 66, was responding well to treatment. The news comes a day after Skripal's daughter Yulia, 33, who was also poisoned in the attack, released her first public statement after regaining consciousness last week. She thanked those who had treated her and her father and all those who had sent "messages of goodwill."
