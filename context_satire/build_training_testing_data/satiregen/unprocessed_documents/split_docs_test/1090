Driving through the mist, David finds his home destroyed and Stephanie dead. Devastated, he drives south, passing destroyed vehicles and a gigantic six-legged, tentacled beast. Running out of gas hours later, the group – except for Billy, who is too young to understand – consent to being euthanized by David rather than endure horrifying deaths from the creatures. David kills them with the four remaining bullets, and leaves the car to be taken by the creatures. The next morning, David and his group prepare to leave the store. Mrs. Carmody tries to stop them and have Billy and schoolteacher Amanda sacrificed, only for Ollie to kill her, destroying her congregation. David and his group then proceed to leave, but as they make their way through the parking lot, Ollie is torn in half by the praying mantis-like creature, Myron and Ambrose are killed by spiders, and Bud runs back inside the store. Only David, Billy, Dan, Amanda, and Irene make it to the car, and the remaining survivors watch them drive off. Pam's boyfriend and Sally's friend. Kirk and Pam decide to go to a creek Franklin told them about, but it has dried up. Kirk then decides to go into the Sawyer house, thinking that they could give them gas in exchange for a guitar. While in the house, Leatherface bashes his head in with a large hammer.
