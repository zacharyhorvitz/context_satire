On December 13, 2017, Governor Dayton announced Smith as his pick to fill the United States Senate seat held by Al Franken, who had announced he would resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct. While political observers initially speculated Smith might serve in a caretaker role, she announced her candidacy in the 2018 special election.  Minnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken returned to Capitol Hill Monday for the first time since reports of sexual harassment against him were earlier this month, apologizing for letting people down and vowing to regain lost trust. At a brief news conference outside his Senate office on Monday morning, Franken was apologetic and said he planned to get back to work. "To all of you, I just want to again say I am sorry. I know there are no magic words that I can say to regain your trust and I know that's going to take time," he said.  Minnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken has no intention of stepping down, a Franken staffer told the Star Tribune on Saturday. A spokesperson for Franken told the Minnesota paper "no" when asked if the senator would resign in the wake of a woman saying Franken forcibly kissed her and groped her while she slept in 2006. "He is spending time with his family in Washington, DC, and will be through the Thanksgiving holiday," the spokesperson said. "And he's doing a lot of reflecting."
