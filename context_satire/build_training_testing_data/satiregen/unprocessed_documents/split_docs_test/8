 I was born with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, a genetic bone and muscular disorder, so I've always been acutely aware of what it means to be different. Yet I've never felt more "other" than I have since the 2016 election, in large part due to the actions of President Donald Trump and his administration. Immediately following his inauguration, the disability section of the White House website was removed -- and it hasn't been added back (for reference, President Barack Obama's White House site is archived and had a dedicated section for disabilities). We've also seen the President's blatant ableism when he mocked a New York Times reporter and, just last week, in his tweet about Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old with Asperger's and Time's Person of the Year.  Both Democrats and Republicans have done their darndest in recent weeks to prove why President Donald Trump should -- or shouldn't -- be impeached. But the American public isn't optimistic that minds will change. A new poll from Monmouth University found 71% say they believe Americans are set in their opinions on the impeachment inquiry, regardless of new information that comes to light. Only 24% say that new information in the impeachment inquiry could change the minds of the American people.  A retiring Democratic member of Congress who has cited his weariness over long-running investigations into President Donald Trump as a primary reason for stepping down said Tuesday he believes many Americans feel the same way. Rep. Denny Heck of Washington, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, announced his retirement earlier this month, writing on Medium, "the countless hours I have spent in the investigation of Russian election interference and the impeachment inquiry have rendered my soul weary." Asked Tuesday in an interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day" if other Democrats feel the same way -- and if that helps explain why recent support for impeaching Trump and removing him from office has dipped slightly since mid-November, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS -- Heck said he believes others are also growing weary. "I think it's happening to Americans, as a matter of fact," Heck said.
