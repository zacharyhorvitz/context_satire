French (Russian: френч) was the designation of a particular type of military jacket or tunic in the Russian Empire and later in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Related words are kurtka, (куртка), kitel (китель; derived from German: Kittel) or pidzhak (пиджак; derived from English:  pea-jacket). In the years immediately preceding the start of World War I, several new models of khaki-grey uniform jackets were adopted in Russia for service wear by Imperial Army officers. In most cases these were related to (and influenced by) the latest creations in the armies of France and the United Kingdom.  After a terrifying attack on a satirical magazine in Paris this week, the gunmen responsible for killing 12 people were shot down in a standoff with police northeast of the capital Friday. At the same time, security forces stormed a kosher supermarket in Paris to end a hostage situation there. The two scenes were linked by the fact that three of the four suspects were thought to be part of the same jihadist group, said Pascal Disant of the Alliance Police Union. Also, the suspects in the second standoff demanded the freedom of the suspects in the first, Disant said.  Sen. Rand Paul thinks that France needs to rethink its immigration policy in light of the recent terror attacks. The Kentucky Republican said Thursday that intelligence and surveillance tactics should still be employed to prevent terrorism, but argued "there's some policy changes, though, that could be better." "I think also you got to secure your country. That means maybe that every Muslim immigrant that wishes to come to France shouldn't have an open door to come," he said on Sean Hannity's radio show, referring to Islamic radicalization in Europe.
