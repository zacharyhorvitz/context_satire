 After a massive resurgence of American militia groups following President Barack Obama's 2008 election, the Southern Poverty Law Center -- which tracks data on the anti-government movement -- reported a decline in patriot groups in 2016. In its annual report, the SPLC found that patriot groups dropped 38% last year and that militias within the patriot movement dropped 40%. The organization attributed this decrease to "(hope) that (Donald) Trump would become the new face of the federal government." So what about American militias not identified and analyzed by the SPLC in its annual report?  Five months after his Indy 500 adventure, Fernando Alonso is set to return to action stateside as Formula One gears up for the United States Grand Prix in Austin. Alonso may have failed in his bid to win the Indianapolis 500 as a rookie in May -- his engine blew up with 21 laps to go of the 200-lap race -- but he came away with a huge admiration for American motorsport fans. "It's a different culture, a different way of understanding motorsport or sport in general -- much more open, much more friendly to all of us," Alonso told CNN's The Circuit. "I imagine if the (Indy 500) was in Spain and some US people came here our favorites would be the Spanish sportsmen and we would cheer for them massively," he added, speaking at his karting circuit in his home town of Oviedo in northern Spain. The meaning of the word American in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. American is derived from America, a term originally denoting all of the New World (also called the Americas). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the United States of America. In modern English, American generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification.
