 George Zimmerman, from his comments to police to the arguments of his lawyers, has steadfastly maintained he shouldn't be found guilty of murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, contending he shot the teen in self-defense. But jurors weighing his fate won't hear that from him directly. On Wednesday afternoon, Judge Debra Nelson asked Zimmerman if he'd made a decision about taking the stand in his own defense. "After consulting with counsel," Zimmerman replied, he'd decided "not to testify, your honor."  The Florida judge presiding over George Zimmerman's murder trial ruled Monday that jurors will be allowed to hear about marijuana found in Trayvon Martin's system the night he was fatally shot. Prosecutors argued the amount was so minimal that "we just don't know" what effect it had on Martin. They also accused the defense of trying to "backdoor some very negative character evidence" into the trial. But the defense said the amount found in Martin's system would have affected his judgment that night and is therefore relevant to the case. Prosecutor John Guy delivered the state's rebuttal argument after the defense finished their closing argument. Guy told the jury that in order to know what happened that night, they should look "into the heart of the grown man and the heart of the child." Guy also argued to the jurors that if Zimmerman had done what he was supposed to do, none of us would be here. Guy also said that if Zimmerman had really wanted the police to get Martin, he would have stayed in his car and waited for the police.
