Consumer perception of green advertisements and greenwashing alike is impacted by where consumers attribute the green messaging. Eco-labels can be given to a product both from an external organization and by the company itself, which has raised concerns considering that companies are able to label a product green or environmentally friendly by selectively disclosing positive attributes of the product while not disclosing negative environmental impacts. Consumers expect to see eco-labels from both internal and external sources but perceive labels from external sources to be more trustworthy. Researchers from the University of Twente found that uncertified or greenwashed internal eco-labels may still contribute to consumer perceptions of a responsible company, with consumers attributing internal motivation to a company’s internal eco-labeling. Global Green works to create a value shift towards a sustainable future for humanity. Global Green is committed to working with local communities to develop a vision for a more sustainable future and solutions for climate-vulnerable neighborhoods. From building green infrastructure, to greening affordable housing, to providing innovative and effective answers to the ever-present challenges of green waste disposal, Global Green engages on the ground and in the meetings that matter for the future of our planet. Greenwashing (a compound word modelled on "whitewash"), also called "green sheen", is a form of marketing spin in which green PR (green values) and green marketing are deceptively used to persuade the public that an organization's products, aims and policies are environmentally friendly and therefore ‘better’; appeal to nature. Common examples present in the marketing of food products, alternative medicine and natural medicine.
