Mike Huckabee appeared on the CBS Evening News on August 1 to discuss the Iowa Straw Poll and his ongoing campaign in Iowa. He was among the Republican debaters in Iowa on August 5, and came in with 8 percent support in a pre-debate poll, tying with John McCain and ahead of his main competitor Sam Brownback who came in with 5 percent. Huckabee was pleased with the results, which showed that he was ahead of all of his second-tier candidates, and said "we think  a great sign for us because it shows that when other candidates are standing still or moving backwards we clearly are moving forward." An Iowa focus group gave Huckabee high marks after the debate, citing that he gave "honest and clear answers" to the questions.  One day after appearing on stage with Rowan County clerk Kim Davis, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said he did not expect her to back down from her position on religious freedom and said the issue is the most important one in the 2016 election. "I think the most important issue in the presidential election is: What do we believe the Constitution teaches about the separation of powers, the distribution of powers?" Huckabee told Alisyn Camerota on CNN's "New Day" on Wednesday. Huckabee starred in what pundits called the highlight of the New Hampshire Republican Debate on September 5, sparring with Congressman Ron Paul in a heated exchange over the war in Iraq and the United States' obligation to the Iraqi people. After Paul stated that U.S. foreign policy is dragging the Republican Party down, Huckabee responded, "Even if we lose elections, we should not lose our honor, and that is more important than the Republican Party." As the third quarter closed, Huckabee was reported to have missed a major GOP conference in Michigan because his campaign could not afford a charter flight. Huckabee rebounded his finances before the end of the third quarter, however, reporting $651,301 on hand.
