 In a posting on the Venezuelan president's official Twitter account, Hugo Chavez said Monday that he had returned to Venezuela from Cuba, where was treated for cancer. "We have arrived again in the Venezuelan homeland," it read. "Thank God! Thank you dear people! "Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castroâ€™s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. I join the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba."  The U.S. government is applying new pressure on Cuba to release an American contractor, who officials say suffers from chronic health problems. One of the largest congressional delegations to the island in recent memory arrived in Havana on Monday with hopes of freeing Alan Gross. Gross is serving a 15-year jail sentence for bringing banned satellite communications equipment into Cuba as part of a State Department program to spread democracy. Gross, who has been held since 2009, said he was working to connect Cuba's small Jewish community to the Internet.
