 A series of deadly bombings claimed more than a dozen lives in Iraq Saturday, according to police and health officials. Seven people were killed and 28 others wounded when three roadside bombs exploded mid-morning in the busy Bab al-Sharji commercial district of central Baghdad, police officials said. Another six men died and 10 others were injured when a roadside bomb hit a minibus carrying young laborers and construction workers in al-Annaz area in eastern Falluja, health and police officials said. The blast occurred at about 5.30 a.m. local time in what is a predominately Sunni area.  At least 13 people were killed Monday when a suicide bomber drove his vehicle into a security checkpoint at a prison in the Taji district of Baghdad, police officials said. Twenty-eight others were injured in the attack, including prison guards and civilians. An investigation is ongoing into the bombing. No groups have yet claimed responsibility, but the attack bears the hallmarks of al Qaeda in Iraq.  U.S. Vice President Joe Biden paid tribute Thursday to the sacrifices of U.S. and Iraqi troops at a ceremony for service members from both nations. He and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki addressed about 120 U.S. service members and 100 Iraqi troops gathered at al-Faw Palace, the Baghdad edifice that once belonged to dictator Saddam Hussein. The trip came amid a U.S. military withdrawal from the Middle Eastern country. Virtually all American troops are scheduled to be out by the end of the year.
