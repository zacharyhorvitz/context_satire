Wayne Martin Messam (born June 7, 1974) is an American former football player, businessman, and politician serving as the mayor of Miramar, Florida, a position he has held since 2015. A member of the Democratic Party, he was first elected to the Miramar City Commission in 2011 before defeating incumbent mayor Lori Cohen Moseley in the 2015 election. Messam is also a general contractor and owner of a construction firm. Messam ran for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2020 United States presidential election.  Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper ended his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, releasing a video in which he nodded at the possibility of a future Senate run. The announcement comes after three Democrats familiar with the matter told CNN on Wednesday that Hickenlooper was poised to drop out. "Today, I'm ending my campaign for President," Hicklenlooper said in the three-minute video.  One man's trash is another man's treasure. Never has that idiom been truer than right now for Democratic campaigns -- both those for president and those tasked with trying to win back the Senate majority in 2020. See, candidates like former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Montana Gov.
