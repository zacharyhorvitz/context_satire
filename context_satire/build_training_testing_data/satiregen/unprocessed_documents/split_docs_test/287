 A decisive election win for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe boosts one of US President Donald Trump's strongest allies in Asia as both Washington and Tokyo grapple with how to handle Pyongyang. Abe, a conservative hawk, has long been a supporter of Trump's more aggressive North Korea policy, which has coincided with his attempts to rewrite Japan's post-war pacifist constitution. Following Sunday's vote, Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera warned the threat from North Korea -- which has repeatedly fired missiles over Japan in recent months -- had reached an "unprecedented, critical and imminent" level. The US, South Korea and Japan need to collectively trial "different responses" for tackling the regime, Onodera told a meeting of the countries' military officials Monday.  Secretary of Defense James Mattis said Saturday that the increasing nuclear threat from North Korea has brought "a new urgency" to military and diplomatic collaboration with South Korea. "The threat from North Korea has grown markedly even since my trip here earlier this year," Mattis said while appearing alongside his South Korean counterpart, Song Young-moo, at a press conference in Seoul. "North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbors and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs," he added, emphasizing that the US "does not accept a nuclear North Korea." The Pentagon chief made his remarks one day after visiting the demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea and meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the country's presidential palace.  Senate intelligence committee investigators have spoken with several Russians who attended a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr., a sign that the matter remains a significant focus for lawmakers looking into potential coordination between Trump associates and Kremlin-linked operatives during the presidential campaign. Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN that the panel has interviewed some of the Russians who were at that meeting, which Trump Jr. attended after being promised dirt on the Clinton campaign and being informed that the Russian government wanted his father to win the presidency. Paul Manafort, who was then the Trump campaign chairman, along with the President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also attended the meeting. The intelligence committee has previously met with both Kushner and Manafort, but has not yet brought in Trump Jr. Burr said the committee is "sequencing" its interviews to speak with everyone else "involved in the meeting before we know exactly what we want from Don Jr."   Burr, R-North Carolina, would not say which Russians, or how many, investigators have spoken with.
