 This Sunday night, more than 100 million people will watch the Super Bowl, TV's biggest spectacle of the year. There will jets and pyrotechnics and Gladys Knight and Big Boi and Maroon 5 and commercials that cost $5 million for just 30 seconds and also some football. And almost all of it is due to one game 50 years ago. Back then, in Super Bowl III, the AFL's New York Jets defeated the NFL's Baltimore Colts in a shocking upset that has come to define the Super Bowl as we know it.  President Trump has agreed to sit down with CBS for a Super Bowl Sunday interview, CBS confirmed Monday. "Face the Nation" moderator Margaret Brennan will speak with the president on Friday, and portions of the interview will air Sunday both on her program and on the Super Bowl pre-game telecast. The Super Bowl rotates between several major networks, and this year it is CBS's turn. It is traditionally the highest-rated event of the year by far.  Cord-cutters are increasingly opting for streaming services over traditional television, but there is still one event that continues to prevail over the air: the Super Bowl. "The Super Bowl is still one of these kind of amazing things in the US, which leads to massive community," said Richard Deitsch, a media reporter for The Athletic. "There are not many things, maybe nothing else in fact, where you can get 100 million plus Americans to rally around something." Viewership for 2018's Super Bowl LII was down 7%, but it was still the tenth most-watched program in US television history with an average viewership of 103.4 million, For comparison, CBS' "The Big Bang Theory" finished last season as the country's most-watched show with an average of 18.63 million viewers.
