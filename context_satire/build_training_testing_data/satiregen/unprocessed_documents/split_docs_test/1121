At the Shredder's hideout, Perry is forced into using the remaining ooze on a wolf and a snapping turtle, which mutate into Tokka and Rahzar. With the imminent threat to April's safety by the Foot, the turtles start to actively look for a new home. After an argument with Leonardo, Raphael breaks off from the group, while Michelangelo discovers an abandoned subway station and deems it a perfect hideout. Raphael and Keno defy Splinter's orders and implant Keno into the Foot Clan to find their hideout. Leo, Donnie, and Mikey plan their next move, while Donatello discovers the next portal will open over Winters' tower. Splinter tells Leonardo that his team is incomplete, and that he knows what he must do. After 11 monsters have been captured, General Aguila questions Yaotl's plans for them and the portal. The generals conspire to betray Yaotl, wanting to remain immortal. Following  The Shredder's defeat at the hands of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in their last adventure, the four along with Splinter live with their news reporter friend April O'Neil while they look for a new home, afraid the Foot will attack them if they return to the sewer. Meanwhile, a young pizza delivery boy named Keno inadvertently encounters burglars on his route and tries to stop them. Seeing him as a witness, the burglars attack Keno, who proves to be a skilled martial artist, but he is soon overwhelmed before the arrival of the turtles. They vanish after rescuing Keno, tying the burglars up and telling Keno to find a phone to call the proper authorities, and taking the pizza he was delivering, leaving behind the money to pay for it (as it was already supposed to be delivered to Aprilâ€™s apartment in the first place).
