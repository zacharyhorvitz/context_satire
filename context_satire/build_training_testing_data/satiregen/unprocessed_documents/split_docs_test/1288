Miranda therefore began a project titled The Hamilton Mixtape. On May 12, 2009, Miranda was invited to perform music from In the Heights at the White House Evening of Poetry, Music and the Spoken Word. Instead, he performed the first song from The Hamilton Mixtape, an early version of what would later become "Alexander Hamilton", Hamilton's opening number. He spent a year after that working on "My Shot", another early number from the show. Eliza and her family—along with Angelica, back from London—travel upstate during the summer, while Hamilton stays home to work on the compromise ("Take a Break"). Hamilton begins an affair with Maria Reynolds, making him vulnerable to her husband's blackmail ("Say No To This"). Hamilton, Jefferson, and James Madison create the Compromise of 1790 over a private dinner, exchanging Hamilton's financial plan for placing the country's permanent capital on the Potomac River. Burr is envious of Hamilton's sway in the government and wishes he had similar power ("The Room Where It Happens"). Though Washington likes Hamilton's idea, Hamilton is unable to sway enough others to get the votes he needs. He is thus unable to get his proposal passed, a fact for which Jefferson and Madison mock him. Washington takes Hamilton aside and orders him to work out a compromise that will get his motion passed, hinting that Hamilton may be forced out of office if he can't manage it. This is resolved in "The Room where it Happens" in which Hamilton negotiates a compromise with Jefferson and Madison: in exchange for Madison getting him the votes to push his plans through Congress, Hamilton agrees to support the placement of the U.S. capital in the south.
