 FedEx is keeping its discount for NRA members. Gun-control advocates and some customers have called for the shipping company to cut ties with the NRA since the school shooting in Florida. Delta, United Airlines and Hertz are among the businesses that have ended NRA discounts. But FedEx said in a statement Monday that the company "has never set or changed rates for any of our millions of customers around the world in response to their politics, beliefs or positions on issues." In May 2000, United announced plans to acquire competitor US Airways in a complex deal valued at $11.6 billion. The offer drew immediate scorn from consumer groups and employees of both airlines. By the following year, regulatory sentiment was against the deal, and United withdrew the offer just before the Department of Justice barred the merger on antitrust grounds in July. The two airlines subsequently formed an amicable partnership that led to US Airways' entrance into the Star Alliance. On April 9, 2017, Dr David Dao was forcibly removed from United Express Flight 3411, sustaining injuries in the process. After the plane had been fully boarded, four members of staff presented themselves for the flight. The company offered compensation to seated passengers to give up their seats, but had no volunteers, and four selected passengers were then told they must leave the plane. Dr Dao refused this instruction and law enforcement officers were called.
