 Andrew McCabe is describing his firing as part of President Donald Trump's "ongoing war" with the FBI and the special counsel investigation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired the former FBI deputy director Friday, two days before McCabe was set to retire, ending  his two-decade career with the bureau. "This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement and intelligence professionals more generally," McCabe said in a statement after his firing. "It is part of this administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the special counsel investigation, which continue to this day.  After more than a year of investigations, accusations and taunting tweets from the President of the United States, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is breaking his silence. The most recent and serious charge he must now defend against: a career-ending claim that he directed FBI officials to talk to a reporter about an ongoing investigation and misled investigators about his actions. "I absolutely never misled the inspector general in any way," McCabe said during an hour-long interview with CNN, calling his highly public downfall the result of "a series of attacks designed to undermine my credibility and my reputation" including by President Donald Trump. After an FBI career spanning more than two decades and ascent to the No.  President Donald Trump has tried to quell talk of chaos in his administration for days, but the last two weeks inside the West Wing have been anything but calm. Over the last 14 days, five top Trump administration officials -- from one of Trump's most trusted communications advisers to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- have either been fired or resigned. The pandemonium belies Trump's tweet earlier this month that boasted "no chaos, only great energy" inside the West Wing. "The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House," Trump wrote.
