 President Donald Trump signed his first bill into law Friday, moments after being sworn in, clearing the way for his defense secretary to be confirmed. The 45th President signed a bill passed by Congress earlier this month that would allow retired Gen. James Mattis to serve as defense secretary by waiving the legal requirement that he be out of the military for seven years before doing so, according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer. Mattis will still need to be confirmed by the Senate, which is expected Friday afternoon. Cameras rolled as Trump signed his first orders as President in the Capitol, surrounded by congressional leaders. Trump's presidency has been marked by significant public concern about conflict of interest stemming from his diverse business ventures. In the lead up to his inauguration, Trump promised to remove himself from the day-to-day operations of his businesses. Trump placed his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. at the head of his businesses claiming they would not communicate with him regarding his interests. However, critics noted that this would not prevent him from having input into his businesses and knowing how to benefit himself, and Trump continued to receive quarterly updates on his businesses.  Donald Trump placed the wreath at Arlington National Cemetery in one of the kick-off ceremonial events in advance of his inauguration at the Capitol on Friday. Flanked by Mike Pence and standing before his children and families, Trump laid the wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington, Virginia. Tom Barrack, the chair of Trump's Inaugural committee and a close friend, said Trump was "transitioning from candidate to president." "If you look at his eyes at Arlington, you see in that moment, in that anticipation of that peaceful transfer of partisan power, that the rhetoric of the campaign moves aside," he told CNN's Dana Bash and Jake Tapper.
