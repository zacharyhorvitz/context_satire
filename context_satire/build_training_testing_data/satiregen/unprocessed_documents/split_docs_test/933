 Powerless to act after yet another mass shooting, all the president of the United States could do was vent. Barack Obama has clasped grieving parents close. His voice has broken as he's read aloud the names of murdered kids. He's wept in the White House briefing room.  News of Thursday's deadly shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, quickly reverberated through Congress, the 2016 campaign trail and the White House, with President Barack Obama making the 15th statement of his presidency addressing gun violence. Obama said "thoughts and prayers" are no longer enough to prevent another mass shooting, calling for more gun-control legislation. "As I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time I see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It's not enough," Obama said from the White House briefing room. Following Obama's election, many pondered the existence of a "postracial America." However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent, and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as "racial venom" directed at Obama's presidency. In July 2009, prominent African-American Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., was arrested at his Cambridge, Massachusetts home by a local police officer, sparking a controversy after Obama stated that the police acted "stupidly" in handling the incident. To reduce tensions, Obama invited Gates and the police officer to the White House in what became known as the "Beer Summit".
