The afghani (sign: Afs or AFs; code: AFN; Pashto: افغانۍ; Dari: افغانی) is the currency of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which is issued by the nation's central bank called Da Afghanistan Bank. It is nominally subdivided into 100 puls (پول), although there are no pul coins currently in circulation. In 2019, one U.S. dollar was exchanged for approximately 75 afghanis.
