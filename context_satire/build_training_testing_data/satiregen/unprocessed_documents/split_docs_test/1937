 Senate Republicans find themselves boxed-in in the wake of President Donald Trump's renewed attacks on the late Sen. John McCain, unwilling to strongly stand up to a President who is widely popular with GOP base voters but still deeply uncomfortable with his criticism of the late war hero and, for many in the chamber, a friend. That fine line Republicans are walking was on display this week when only a few of them weighed in on Trump's sustained assault on McCain and those who did speak out issued tepid statements that praised McCain's military and political service to the country but stopped short of criticizing Trump for his harsh rhetoric. The clearest example of this came from Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, who is known as McCain's soul mate in the Senate but who is also up for re-election in 2020 and in need of Trump's continued political backing. Speaking in a subdued voice, he told WLOS TV in Spartanburg Wednesday that he is not happy with Trump's attacks on McCain but that, "I'll try to continue to help the President."  Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is stuck once again between a President whose support he needs to win re-election and his lifelong friendship with the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, who encouraged all to put country first. But time and political necessity have softened Graham's public grievances with President Donald Trump. The presidential embrace has been months in the making. Beginning with golf outings with Trump, Graham now frequently takes calls from the President.  In his latest attack on John McCain, President Donald Trump accused the late senator of misleading the White House about his vote on a GOP effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017 after spending years campaigning on repealing it. Facts First: Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over his intention to vote on the GOP drafted bill to repeal Obamacare -- but McCain on several occasions publicly expressed his opposition prior to the vote. McCain did, however, campaign on repealing it. McCain's actions in the days, and even the hours leading up to his dramatic decision to come down against the Republican attempt to undo the law known as Obamacare, call into question Trump's version of events leading up to the vote.
