On 23 May, Assange was indicted on 17 new charges relating to the Espionage Act of 1917 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Espionage Act charges carry a maximum sentence of 170 years in prison. The Obama administration had debated charging Assange under the Espionage Act but decided against it out of fear that it would have a negative effect on investigative journalism and could be unconstitutional. The new charges relate to obtaining and publishing the secret documents.  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, whose seven-year stay in the Ecuadorian embassy in London ended after his arrest on Thursday, has long claimed the US wanted him behind bars for sharing files the government didn't want the world to see. When the Justice Department finally unsealed the indictment against him Thursday, it contained a single charge alleging a conspiracy to help Chelsea Manning, the then-US Army intelligence officer who gave files to Assange in 2010, crack a password. Should Assange be extradited from the UK and convicted the maximum sentence he could serve is five years A US official briefed on the matter told CNN that the Justice Department expect to bring additional charges. It's not clear whether those charges would relate directly to WikiLeaks publishing classified material.  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been charged with helping the former Army intelligence specialist Chelsea Manning access Defense Department computers in 2010 in an effort to disclose secret government documents, the US Justice Department announced Thursday morning, hours after Assange was forcibly removed by authorities from the Ecuadoran embassy in London. More than a year ago, a federal grand jury indicted Assange for one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. The case had been kept under seal until Thursday, and its unveiling marks a new chapter in the US government's high-profile efforts to discourage classified document leaks and to pursue Assange. It's not clear yet whether or how Assange's claims as a journalist under the First Amendment, which his organization, supporters and lawyers have pushed, will factor into this case.
