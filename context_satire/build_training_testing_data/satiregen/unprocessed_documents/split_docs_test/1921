 Aysha al-Daheri is standing on an airport runway a little after midnight. Behind her, a C-17 military aircraft is being loaded up with 15 tons' worth of aid bundles. Al-Daheri, the head of the United Arab Emirates Medical Support Team in Yemen, is wearing traditional garb instead of her usual military fatigues. She has led numerous, little-known Emirati medical missions around the world, from Bosnia to Afghanistan.  Striking new drone images from the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, sheds light on the rarely accessible, rebel-held city, under siege for years and bombarded by airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition. The images were filmed in June by Brazilian photojournalist Gabriel Chaim, who was given limited access by the Houthi rebels who control the city, from where they unseated the Yemeni government in 2015. The footage shows the damage wrought to some of the buildings, but also its enduring beauty and how life goes on amid the rubble and carnage. The video was shot amid stalling peace talks to slow the siege of the vital port city of Hodeidah. Yemenis in the United Kingdom include citizens and non-citizen immigrants in the United Kingdom of Yemeni ancestry, as well as their descendants. Yemenis have been present in the UK since the 1860s, and are probably the longest-established Muslim group in the country, although currently much smaller than some other British Muslim groups.
