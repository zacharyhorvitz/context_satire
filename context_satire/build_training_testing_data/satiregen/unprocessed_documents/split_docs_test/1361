The approval of the Senate and the House of Representatives is required for a bill to become law. Both Houses must pass the same version of the bill; if there are differences, they may be resolved by a conference committee, which includes members of both bodies. For the stages through which bills pass in the Senate, see Act of Congress. he constitutional prerogative of the House has been held to apply to all the general appropriations bills, and the Senate's right to amend these has been allowed the widest possible scope. The upper house may add to them what it pleases; may go altogether outside of their original provisions and tack to them entirely new features of legislation, altering not only the amounts but even the objects of expenditure, and making out of the materials sent them by the popular chamber measures of an almost totally new character.  The House of Representatives passed a bill banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy on Wednesday. The measure passed mostly on a party line vote, 242-184, with one member voting present. Earlier this year House Republican leaders were forced to cancel a vote on the legislation, known as the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," when several female House Republican members rebelled against it. They argued some provisions dealing with exceptions for rape could threaten the party's efforts to attract support from women and younger voters.
