 The birth of a child. There's nothing quite like it. Especially when your baby is delivered in the middle of the night on the floorboard of your car while you're speeding down California's 580 freeway. That's how January 24, 1981, began for Donald Lacy. In August 2014, Barrymore stated that he would be presenting a new show called Stealing The Limelight which would be similar to My Kind of People where he and a co-presenter called Barrie Drewitt-Barlow would travel the country and allow members of the public to audition for the chance to appear on the show. Dates were booked in Liverpool, Manchester and London. However, this came to nothing and the Twitter page for the new show now no longer exists.  Julian Assange has been sentenced to just under a year in a UK prison on Wednesday after he was found guilty of violating his bail conditions when he entered Ecuador's London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden in 2012. "You had a choice and the course of action you chose was to commit an offense," Judge Deborah Taylor said. "You have not surrendered willingly. Had the government of Ecuador not permitted entry to the embassy, you would not have voluntarily come before the court," she added, before handing down an "imprisonment of 50 weeks."
