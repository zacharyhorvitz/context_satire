Before the early 1930s, the Miami University nicknames were interchangeable, including the Miami Boys, the Big Reds, and the Reds and Whites. The first glimpse of the Miami University Redskins was in 1928, when a Miami student referred to their team as the Big Red-Skinned Warriors. By 1931, the Redskins had stuck as the Miami University nickname, and was the official nickname of the Miami University athletics program for nearly seventy years. Tom Holland, who plays Parker in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, praised the film as "one of the coolest films  ever seen," while Holland's MCU co-star Chris Pratt, who also worked with Lord and Miller in The Lego Movie films, called it an "emotionally moving, cutting edge, progressive, diverse, funny, meta, action-packed, silly, visually stunning masterpiece!" Patton Oswalt, who also worked with Lord and Miller on 22 Jump Street, called the film "brilliant" and continued "This has been a non-stop year for me and I'm glad I'm ending it in such a cinematic high-note. Not only is it the best superhero film ever made, it's flat-out a game-changing MOVIE. Seeing it again tomorrow!" Fr.
