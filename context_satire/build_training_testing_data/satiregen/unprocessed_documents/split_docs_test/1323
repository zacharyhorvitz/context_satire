On October 30, 2014, Cook came out as gay in an editorial for Bloomberg Business, "I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me." He consulted with Anderson Cooper, who had publicly come out himself, on aspects of the statement, and cleared the timing to ensure it would not distract from business interests.

As Apple Inc. CEO, Cook regularly begins sending emails at 4:30Â a.m. and previously held Sunday-night staff meetings by telephone to prepare for the next week.

Under Cook's leadership, Apple has increased its donations to charity, and in 2013, he hired Lisa Jackson, formerly the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to assist Apple with the development of its renewable energy activities.
