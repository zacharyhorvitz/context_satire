At this point, Henry VII faced the challenge of avoiding the obligation to return her 200,000 ducat dowry, half of which he had not yet received, to her father, as required by her marriage contract should she return home. Following the death of Queen Elizabeth in February 1503, King Henry VII initially considered marrying Catherine himself, but the opposition of her father and potential questions over the legitimacy of the couple's issue ended the idea. To settle the matter, it was agreed that Catherine would marry Henry VII's second son, Henry, Duke of York, who was five years younger than she was. The death of Catherine's mother, however, meant that her "value" in the marriage market decreased. Percyval was the grandson of the successful American businessman Frederic Tudor. He and his brother William Owen Tudor-Hart DSO both changed their surname to Tudor-Hart in adulthood, possibly to strengthen their ties to the Tudor name. Their parents were divorced owing to their father being a "constant and habitual frequenter of houses of ill-fame" in Montreal. Percyval's first wife (Alexander's mother) was the daughter of his aunt Euphemia "Effie" Tudor-Kleczkowska, who had married the Polish-French diplomat Michel Alexandre Cholewa, comte Kleczkowski (Michał Kleczkowski; 1818–1886). The daughter of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, Catherine was three years old when she was betrothed to Arthur, Prince of Wales, heir apparent to the English throne. They married in 1501, but Arthur died five months later. She held the position of ambassador of the Aragonese Crown to England in 1507, the first female ambassador in European history. Catherine subsequently married Arthur's younger brother, the recently ascended Henry VIII, in 1509.
