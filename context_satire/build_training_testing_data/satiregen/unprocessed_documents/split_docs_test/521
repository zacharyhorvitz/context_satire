 Hellbent on besting Barack Obama at everything, Donald Trump began talking about his potential Nobel Peace Prize long before the date set for his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He heaped praise on the most repressive leader in the world -- "very honorable" were the words he used -- and the White House Military Office even issued a commemorative medal for the upcoming summit which, bizarrely, called Kim "Supreme Leader." But Thursday, with a letter to Kim that is true to the cartoon nature of his personality, Trump cites "the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement" and canceled the peace talks in a fit of childish pique. This came after Vice President Mike Pence's threat that the North Korean government could be toppled as Libya's was if Kim didn't come to heel -- a threat that prompted a North Korean official to call Pence a "political dummy."  A North Korean official has lashed out at US Vice President Mike Pence and said Pyongyang is ready for a nuclear showdown if dialogue with the United States fails. Choe Son Hui, a vice-minister in the North Korean Foreign Ministry, said if the US continued on its current path, she would suggest to North Korea's leadership that they reconsider the planned summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. "Whether the US will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision and behavior of the United States," Choe said in comments carried by North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency Thursday. Choe was responding to comments by Pence made Monday during a Fox News interview that she deemed "unbridled and impudent."  North Korea says Kim Jong Un is still willing to meet Donald Trump "at any time," despite the US President's abrupt cancellation of what would have been a historic summit between the two leaders, scheduled for June 12. Kim Kye Gwan, a top official at North Korea's Foreign Ministry, said Trump's decision to cancel the talks ran counter to the global community's wishes for peace on the Korean Peninsula. "We would like to make known to the US side once again that we have the intent to sit with the US side to solve problem(s) regardless of ways at any time," said Kim in comments published Friday by the country's state-run news agency KCNA. Kim said President Trump's decision is "not consistent with the desire of humankind for peace and stability in the world, to say nothing of those in the Korean Peninsula."
