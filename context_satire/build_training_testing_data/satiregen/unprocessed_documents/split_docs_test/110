Although the use of CB radios in the UK is limited they are still popular, especially with the farming community, truckers and mini-cab services.

The normal calling and truckers' channel is channel 19, although many truck organisations and groups use other channels to avoid abuse. Ultra-high frequency (UHF) radios, at the time, were neither practical nor affordable for the average consumer. On 11 September 1958:14 CB service class D was created on 27 MHz, and this band became what is popularly known today as "Citizens Band". Only 23 channels were available at the time; the first 22 were taken from the former amateur radio service 11 meter band, and channel 23 was shared with radio-controlled devices. Some hobbyists continue to use the designation "11 meters" to refer to the Citizens Band and adjoining frequencies.
