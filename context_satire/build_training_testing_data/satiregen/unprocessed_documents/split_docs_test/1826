 House Speaker John Boehner realized that managing the massive crowd descending on the Capitol grounds for Pope Francis' visit will require a small army -- so he created one. When Francis makes the first papal visit to Congress next Thursday, this mini-army -- the first-ever volunteer force of over 100 House and Senate aides -- will provide far more help than the ordinary mix of security, administrative and events staff that typically coordinate a visit from a world later. The "special events reps" will wear green, Boehner's favorite color and the liturgical color of this season in the Catholic Church, and serve as the face of Congress, guiding visitors to spots to view the speech, answering questions about etiquette, and supporting security personnel. At a time when Republicans and Democrats are at loggerheads over virtually everything -- the federal government could close at the end of the month unless the parties reach an agreement -- the pope's visit is one of the rare occasions where adversaries on Capitol Hill are coming together.  Pope Francis landed on U.S. soil for the first time Tuesday evening. On Wednesday, the Pope will hold his first public events in Washington. Here are five things to watch on this historic day. 1.  Climate change, Cuba and poverty are the issues the White House expects to top the agenda when President Barack Obama welcomes Pope Francis on Wednesday. But beyond hot-button political topics, a senior White House official said the two men enjoy a rapport that means many different subjects could be raised, should the Pope be so inclined. "The President values hearing from the Pope on a number of issues that they both care about," the official said. "We expect that the Pope will feel very comfortable bringing up any issues on his mind."
