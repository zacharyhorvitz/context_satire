The official sign hanging for Reggie White Boulevard took place on Monday, December 8, 2008, at 2 p.m. at the intersection of 20th and Carter Street in Chattanooga, Tennessee. White's mother, Thelma White Collier, along with other family and friends, were on hand to witness the change to Reggie White Boulevard. The official name change was approved by the Chattanooga City Council on November 4, 2008. Episode notes: This is part 3 of a 5-part tournament. In the appetizer round, Chef Torres used (cocoa nibs) that he brought with him, which were not available in the pantry. The judges felt that this was contrary to the rules and cited it as the reason for his elimination. Episode notes: Chef Harriott cut herself in the appetizer round and put on a glove but removed it prior to plating, contaminating her dish in the process. After the other chefs gave their consent, the judges allowed her to bring the non contaminated components of her dish from her station to the judges table. Chef Joshi works at Tertulia, under occasional Chopped judge Seamus Mullen.
