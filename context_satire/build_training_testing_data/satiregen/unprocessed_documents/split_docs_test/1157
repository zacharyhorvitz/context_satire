In spite of the fact that Montana went for Donald Trump by nearly 20 percent two years prior, incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Tester managed to win reelection to a third term against Republican State Auditor Matt Rosendale, who conceded the election to Tester on November 7, 2018. This was the first Senate election in which Tester received a majority of votes cast rather than a simple plurality. On June 6, 2006, Burns easily won the Republican primary. In the November general election, his Democratic opponent was Montana State Senate President and organic farmer Jon Tester. In early August, CQPolitics changed its rating on the race from "Leans Republican" to "No Clear Favorite." According to some polls, Burns's approval rating had fallen as low as 39 percent, lower than any other U.S. Stan Jones (born January 13, 1943) is a Libertarian Party politician who has twice  run unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 2002 and 2006, and has run twice unsuccessfully for governor of Montana, in 2000 and 2004.
