 President Donald Trump's latest tirade against Robert Mueller's investigation does not appear to have prompted many Capitol Hill Republicans to reconsider the need for legislation to protect the special counsel. Instead, GOP lawmakers maintained Tuesday that additional protections aren't necessary all but offered a sobering warning: any move by Trump to oust Mueller would be cataclysmic for his presidency. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley told CNN, "I think it would be suicide for the President to fire him. I think the less the President says about this whole thing, the better off he will be.  Mike Pompeo, the Trump administration's nominee to lead the State Department, told senators on the Foreign Relations committee on Thursday he has cooperated with special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. "I spoke with special counsel Mueller, who interviewed me, requested an interview, I cooperated," he told the committee's top Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez, who asked about the investigation, during his confirmation hearing. He also said President Donald Trump has never asked him do anything "improper" as it relates to the Russia probe during then-FBI Director James Comey's time as FBI director, but he declined to say if the President asked him to do anything about the Comey probe and could not "recall" the nature of a March 2017 conversation where Trump reportedly asked Pompeo to get Comey to pull back. "I am not going to talk about private conversations I've had with the President," he said.  The longest-serving Republican senator in history offered a sharp rebuke Thursday to anyone recommending that President Donald Trump fire special counsel Robert Mueller. "Anyone advising the President — in public or over the airwaves — to fire Bob Mueller does not have the President or the nation's best interest at heart. Full stop," Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, tweeted. The Utah Republican's remarks comes shortly after Trump's tweet early Thursday morning that if he wanted to fire Mueller, "I would have fired him" after it was reported he has discussed firing Mueller for months.
