 Someone could win the largest lottery prize in American history Wednesday night. Not to be a killjoy, but there's only a 0.0000003% chance it will be you. The Powerball jackpot has reached $700 million, the second largest in U.S. history. The only larger jackpot was a $1.6 billion prize that was split by three winning tickets in January 2016.  Here we go again. After Wednesday night's Powerball drawing yielded no jackpot winners, the prize climbed from $430 million to a gargantuan $510 million. The numbers drawn Wednesday were 9, 15, 43, 60, 64 and the Powerball was 4. The grand prize pool has been growing since June 10 -- meaning there have been 19 straight drawings with no winner.  The Powerball jackpot keeps climbing. Lottery officials say the grand prize for Wednesday night's drawing has reached $700 million -- the second-largest on record for any U.S. lottery game. The prize pool has been growing since June 10, the last time somebody won. The most recent drawing was Saturday.
