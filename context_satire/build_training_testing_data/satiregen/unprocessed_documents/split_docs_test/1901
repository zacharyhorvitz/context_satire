It was while attending Princeton that Fitzgerald met Chicago socialite and debutante Ginevra King on a visit back home in St. Paul. King and Fitzgerald had a romantic relationship from 1915 to 1917. Immediately infatuated with her, according to Mizner, Fitzgerald "remained devoted to Ginevra as long as she would allow him to", and wrote to her "daily the incoherent, expressive letters all young lovers write". She would become his inspiration for the character of Isabelle Borgé, Amory Blaine's first love in This Side of Paradise, for Daisy in The Great Gatsby, and several other characters in his novels and short stories. David delivers the drugs to Gurdlinger, who tells him he is late and that their deal is off, then admits that he had never intended to pay him at all. DEA agents suddenly storm the office to arrest Gurdlinger, revealing that David had previously told them of the situation and his association with Gurdlinger. Don, the agent in charge of the raid, tells David that he will have to be placed in the witness protection program until the trials of Gurdlinger and Chacón are finished, which will take three to six months. He then adds that anyone who was a witness will also need to be put into protection, which pleases David. Molly Fitzgerald was born in Dunshaughlin, Ireland, and was the daughter of a militant member of the IRA. As Shamrock, she serves as a vessel for displaced poltergeists and souls that have died as innocent victims of war; these spirits manifest themselves for fractions of seconds to cause good luck for her and bad luck for those who oppose her.
