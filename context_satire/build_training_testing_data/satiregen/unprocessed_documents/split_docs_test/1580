This video series centered around two children named Timmy and Penny and their Baby Sister, their parents, and their dog Lucky. In 1991, the Original Little People figures were redesigned for children. They were made "chunkier", were more bright and colorful, and were designed so that they could activate motion within the play sets. In 2002 Fisher-Price introduced the Kasey the Kinderbot (pictured center) Educational line of toys that was capable of teaching 40 learning skills to pre-schoolers including basic math, reading, and science. "Kasey, which speaks English, Spanish, and French was Fischer-Price's first preschool electronic learning aid, a category of toys that has ballooned in recent years as parents scramble to give their children an edge well before they enter preschool". Kasey has moving eyes, head, waist, arms and hands all of which are coordinated to its voice and LCD display screen. According to Fisher-Price Kasey incorporated the use of a special learning circuit for reinforcement and education.
