 Federal prosecutors in New York on Monday unsealed a criminal indictment charging multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein with having operated a sex trafficking ring in which he sexually abused dozens of underage girls. But the allegations of sexual misconduct against him aren't anything new -- they first emerged over a decade ago. Here's how they've been treated in the years since they first emerged. Former US Attorney's 'deal of a lifetime'  Epstein, 66, is accused of running a trafficking enterprise between 2002 and 2005, allegedly paying hundreds of dollars in cash to girls as young as 14 to have sex with him at his Upper East Side home and his estate in Palm Beach, according to the indictment.  One girl says she celebrated her 16th birthday with multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein during the time he was sexually abusing her. Another says she was just a middle schooler when she was first brought to his Palm Beach mansion and was abused. Then there's the teen who says Epstein groomed her for abuse by promising to help her get into college. The stories are among those from dozens of girls -- now women -- who have publicly shared their allegations of sexual abuse by Epstein, in media reports and lawsuits, for more than a decade.  A new state law in New York could give Jeffrey Epstein's alleged victims more opportunities to seek justice. In January, the state legislature passed the Child Victims Act, which expanded the statute of limitations in child sex abuse cases to give survivors more time to seek criminal charges or sue their abusers -- or both. Under the new law, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed in February, survivors of child sexual assault can pursue criminal felony charges until they turn 28, and file a civil lawsuit before age 55.
