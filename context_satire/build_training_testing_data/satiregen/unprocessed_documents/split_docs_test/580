During the second presidential campaign debate with President Barack Obama in October 2012, Obama said that "Gov. Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making. ...  suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage." Romney responded, "I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.  GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney received boos from the audience at the NAACP Convention in Houston Wednesday when he said he would repeal "Obamacare." In response to the crowd's cries, Romney said at a separate event later that same day that "if I don't stand for what they want, go vote for someone else." House Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD) tells Soledad O'Brien on CNN's "Starting Point" this morning that the response wasn't exactly unexpected. "I don't think Romney was surprised that he was going to get an adverse reaction," Rep. Hoyer says.  Barack Obama and Mitt Romney resumed campaigning Monday, with both men focusing on the economy as key to their chances of winning the votes of Americans in November. Obama told supporters in Cincinnati that he entered office four years ago seeking to restore "the basic bargain that made America the greatest nation on Earth." He cited the idea that "if you work hard, then you can get ahead; if you're responsible, then you can live out your dreams. You're not confined to the circumstances of your birth."
