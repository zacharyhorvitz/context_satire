 President Donald Trump is openly wondering what happened to the collection of officials he described only five months ago as the "finest group of people ever assembled" as members of his Cabinet find themselves embroiled in ethics scandals or woefully at odds with the White House. He has complained in recent days that his Cabinet has fallen well short of his expectations and wants to purge all the "deadweight," one official said. He fired one of those people -- Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- on Tuesday. And he's grown increasingly frustrated with at least two others, according to people familiar with the matter: Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin and Housing and Urban Development chief Ben Carson. At the November 9, 2011, Republican debate, Perry began a fiery statement about his platform, pledging to eliminate three government agencies as part of his policy to cut federal spending, but after naming the Departments of Education and Commerce, was unable to remember the name of the third agency, eventually declaring "I can't. The third one, I can't. Sorry. Oops."  Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Thursday he is not interested in leaving his post for another cabinet position. Perry spoke as he arrived at a budget hearing on Capitol Hill, and told CNN he has no interest in replacing embattled Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin. "I've got the perfect job," Perry said. "I'm a happy man," he told CNN, saying "no," when asked specifically if he was interested in the VA post.
