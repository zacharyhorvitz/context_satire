The Westlake School for Girls was established in 1904 by Jessica Smith Vance and Frederica de Laguna in what is now downtown Los Angeles, California, as an exclusively female institution offering both elementary and secondary education. It was so-named because it was near Westlake Park, now known as MacArthur Park. At the time, the school was a for-profit alternative to the already-established Marlborough School, which had been established as a non-profit before the turn of the century. Los Cerritos Middle School is a public middle school in Thousand Oaks, California. It is one of the five middle schools in Conejo Valley Unified School District. It was named a Blue Ribbon school under the No Child Left Behind Act in 2004, along with Westlake High School, also in the district. The school colors are blue and gray, and the school mascot is the leopard. Bernanke was educated at East Elementary, J.V. Martin Junior High, and Dillon High School, where he was class valedictorian and played saxophone in the marching band. Since Dillon High School did not offer calculus at the time, Bernanke taught it to himself. Bernanke scored 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT and was a National Merit Scholar.
