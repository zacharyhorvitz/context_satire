 President Donald Trump is not angry at his attorney Rudy Giuliani, despite the former New York mayor's contradictory answers in recent interviews about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow, sources told CNN Tuesday -- and Giuliani is not going anywhere. A source familiar with the Trump legal team told CNN on Tuesday, "Rudy's not getting fired." Giuliani has been the subject of intense scrutiny this week after talking himself into hot water during interviews on Sunday morning news programs. In one interview, Giuliani said Trump had been in talks over the proposed Moscow Trump Tower project throughout the presidential campaign, possibly as late as October or November 2016.  Here's a good way to think about Rudy Giuliani's handling of questions about when (or if) President Donald Trump had conversations during the 2016 campaign with his one-time lawyer Michael Cohen about plans to build Trump Tower Moscow: You throw 10 balls in the air at once and, only as they are all hurtling back toward you -- and the ground -- do you realize you only have two hands and can't possibly hope to catch them all. Over the past 48 hours, it has all come crashing down around Giuliani. Let's start on Sunday, when Giuliani did a round of Sunday show interviews -- including one with "Meet the Press" host Chuck Todd. Here's the relevant exchange about how long Trump was talking to Cohen about the potential project (bolding is mine): Giuliani: Well, it's our understanding that it -- that they went on throughout 2016.  President Donald Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani said Monday that the President had no recollection of whether discussions about a proposed Trump Tower Moscow project went through the 2016 election, distancing himself from a claim he made Sunday. Giuliani's remarks were an attempt at damage control after comments he made a day prior when he said the talks about the Moscow project continued through the campaign, even possibly as late as October or November 2016. Adjusting his previous timeline, Giuliani told CNN on Monday that there was no way of determining exactly when the discussions ended because they had no record of it. "My recent statements about discussions during the 2016 campaign between Michael Cohen and then-candidate Donald Trump about a potential Trump Moscow 'project' were hypothetical and not based on conversations I had with the President," Giuliani said in a statement.
