Skarsg책rd was brought up by humanist, atheist parents, and had an atheist grandfather and a deeply religious grandmother. According to Skarsg책rd, this never led to any problems because of the family's mutual respect for each other's opinions. After the September 11 attacks, Skarsg책rd set out to read the Bible and the Quran, both of which he condemns as violent. Skarsg책rd is also a critic of religious independent schools in the Swedish educational system. Jones quickly became embroiled in controversy when he attempted to hire his longtime friend and former Baylor University coach Art Briles as an assistant. Briles had been fired from Baylor for his actions in connection with a major sexual assault scandal at the school. Following a media firestorm, the team reversed the decision to hire Briles. Frustrated with what he viewed as a lack of support from the University, Jones opted to leave Hawaii at the end of the 2007 season. After initial reports had him interviewing at SMU, Hawaii officials had offers to raise his salary from $800,000 a year to $1.7 million a year and offered a commitment to improve its facilities; in addition there was an outpouring of support from Hawaii fans, including Gov. Linda Lingle. However, Jones contacted Hawaii on January 7, 2008 and let them know he had decided to accept an offer from SMU.
