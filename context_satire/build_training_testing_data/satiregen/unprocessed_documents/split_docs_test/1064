Back at school, Olivia sees hallucinations calling on her to pick truth or dare. After being harassed by the aggressive hallucinations she picks "truth" and blurts out that that Markie has been serially unfaithful to Lucas. The other friends disbelieve her explanation of a cursed game until they learn that Ronnie was forced to kill himself after failing to complete a dare. Lucas gets messages from the game until he picks "truth" and admits that he has always had feelings for Olivia. Prior to Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, San Francisco 49ers player Chris Culliver on media day during an interview with The Artie Lange Show, was asked if he thought any gay players were on his team which he replied, "No, we don't got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do ... Can't be with that sweet stuff." He also opined that any gay players should wait 10 years after retiring before coming out. Culliver received backlash for his comments. Then-Baltimore Ravens player Brendon Ayanbadejo, an advocate for same-sex marriage, estimated that 50 percent of the league agreed with Culliver, 25 percent disagreed, and 25 percent were accepting of everyone even if they were not in complete support of issues such as gay marriage.
