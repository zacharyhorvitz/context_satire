 Pope Francis, who has caused the heads of right-wing Catholics to swivel before, has done it again, proclaiming that the death penalty is inadmissible in all cases "because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person." He also said that Christians should work "with determination" for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide. Good for him, and good for the teachings of Jesus in this important regard, which have been wildly neglected, particularly by Christians in the United States. Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount, was absolutely clear about vengeful justice. Christian (Czech: Kristián) is a Czech comedy film directed by Martin Frič. It was released in 1939. The film is based on a French play. On the first of every month, a mysterious guest, who goes by the name Kristián, appears in the fashionable Orient Bar.  The Trump administration's threats to issue economic sanctions against Turkey late last week rapidly escalated increasing tensions between the two countries. And at the center of this international incident is one man: a detained American pastor named Andrew Brunson. To Turkey, Brunson is a spy who attempted to overthrow the government during a 2016 coup attempt. But to US officials, Brunson is an innocent Christian family man who is being wrongfully detained.
