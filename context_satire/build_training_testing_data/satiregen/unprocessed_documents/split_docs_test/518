Texas (, locally ; Spanish: Texas or Tejas, pronounced  (listen)) is the second largest state in the United States by area (after Alaska) and population (after California). Located in the South Central region, Texas shares borders with the states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the southwest, and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth largest in the U.S., while San Antonio is the second-most populous in the state and seventh largest in the U.S. Dallas–Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country, respectively. Other major cities include Austin, the second-most populous state capital in the U.S., and El Paso.  After an intense fire season, the Texas Forest Service finally has a reprieve from firefighting. The Bastrop Complex fire, which torched more than 1,500 homes and 34,000 acres of land north of Austin, is now 100% contained, the Texas Fire Service said. Monday marks the first time in the 49 days that the agency wasn't facing down any fires over 100 acres. The fires this year burned more than 3.5 million acres in Texas, according to state officials.  Much-needed rain fell across drought-stricken Texas on Sunday, offering relief but no end to what's been one of the state's driest years on record. Some areas received more rain in a day than had fallen all summer. Waco, Texas, where temperatures hit at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit 78 days this year, received 5.83 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. Dallas got 1.37 inches of rain, while San Antonio received 3.06 inches -- a record for the date.
