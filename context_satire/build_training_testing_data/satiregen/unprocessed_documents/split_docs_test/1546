 A week after Samsung was ordered to pay $1 billion to Apple for patent infringements, a Japanese court has backed the South Korean company in another dispute with its U.S. rival. The Tokyo District Court on Friday ruled that Samsung did not infringe Apple's patents for its iPhone and iPad for some of its Galaxy smartphones and the Galaxy tablet. The case focused on technology used in Samsung's Galaxy S, Galaxy S2 and Galaxy Tab 7 devices to synchronize music and video with a computer -- technology Apple says its rival copied. However Judge Tamotsu Shoji disagreed and threw out Apple's 100 million yen ($1.27 million) claim and ordered the California-based tech giant to pay the costs of the lawsuit.  The Apple-Samsung patent mega-trial is approaching the finish line, but the consequences for users of all smartphones may be just beginning. On Monday, Apple requested an injunction against eight Samsung devices, including multiple variations of the Galaxy S and S II, the Droid Charge and the Galaxy Prevail. A California jury on Friday found that those smartphones violated patents including pinch-zooming, bounce-back scrolling and the appearance of icons on the screen. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh will consider the injunction on Sept. 20, and if she grants it, Samsung could be forced to take those gadgets off the market.  The share price of Samsung Electronics dropped nearly 7.5% in trading Monday as investors had their first opportunity to react to the more than $1 billion decision against the Korean electronics giant by a California jury for infringing on Apple patents. Samsung dropped 6.3% at the open of South Korea's Kospi index and finished the day down 7.45%, after dropping as much as 7.7%. The tumble erased about $12 billion from the company's market value Monday. Samsung is planning to appeal Friday's decision of a U.S. federal jury which awarded Apple $1.05 billion for copying the look and feel of iPhones and iPad design.
