 Donald Trump on Friday had an unusual encounter with a protester. A protester in the seats behind Trump on Friday lifted a sign that read "Islamophobia is not the answer." But even after a Trump supporter ripped the sign away, the man lingered not far from Trump's stage. Waiting for security, police or staff to spring into action, Trump paced the stage and came close to the man, who had removed a jacket to reveal a shirt with the words "KKK endorses Trump" and a yellow star reminiscent of those worn by Jews during the Holocaust on his chest.  NASCAR's chief executive and several NASCAR drivers endorsed Donald Trump on Monday, just one day before a cluster of Southern states vote in the GOP's Super Tuesday contests. Brian France, the racing association's CEO, appeared Monday alongside Trump during a rally at Valdosta State University, touting the Republican front-runner's success in his business and personal life. "You know about his winning in business and success. I'm gonna tell you, he wins with his family," said France, who noted that he's known Trump for more than two decades. On the Raw Is War after Austin won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, Vince McMahon presented him with a new title belt and warned Austin that he did not approve of his rebellious nature and that things could be done "the easy way or the hard way". Austin gave his answer in the form of another Stone Cold Stunner. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to "play ball" with McMahon, appearing in a suit and tie, with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin who in the course of the segment proceeded to tear off the suit, tell McMahon it was the last time he would see Austin dressed like this, punch his boss in the "corporate grapefruits" and take another picture of the two of them while McMahon was doubled over in pain.
