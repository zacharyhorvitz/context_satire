 President Barack Obama is set to deliver his seventh and final State of the Union address on Tuesday, where he is expected to outline his remaining goals as he finishes his second term. The President's February 2009 speech was delivered before a joint session of Congress, but is not considered an official State of the Union address. In a teaser video released last week, Obama expressed optimism for the year and said his speech would go beyond what he hopes to accomplish in his last months as president, but also on what he would like to see in the years to come. "While I'm writing, my team is cooking up new ways you can watch and engage with the speech," the President said.  South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is a "natural" and will deliver a "great" response to the State of the Union, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Monday. Haley will respond to President Barack Obama's speech for the Republican Party on Tuesday, an honor bestowed on rising stars in the GOP. The high-profile event has been both a launching pad for careers and an opportunity for embarrassment, depending on how the politician performs.  He's a lame duck president entering his final year in office. The race to replace him is in full swing, and when he gives his State of the Union address, the first caucuses and primaries of 2016 will be right around the corner. But that doesn't mean Barack Obama is going to leave the limelight quietly. The White House last month insisted Obama would give his final State of the Union address in a "non-traditional" way.
