Unfortunately, being James Bond meant surrendering his own sense of self, and he walked away from the fame and fortune that would've come with the role, settled back in Australia, and became a realtor where he married, raised a family, and led a happy and normal life. In 1938, refugee Peter Vadassy (James Mason) decides to take a vacation at the Hotel Reserve to celebrate both his completion of medical school and his impending French citizenship. When he goes to pick up some photographs at the local pharmacy, he is taken away and questioned by Michel Beghin (Julien Mitchell) of French naval intelligence. When his negatives had been developed, some of them turned out to be of French military installations. It is discovered that while the camera is the same make as Peter's, the serial number is different. Becoming Bond is an American documentary drama film that premiered on Hulu on May 5, 2017. Directed, written and produced by Josh Greenbaum, it explores the casting of Australian model George Lazenby as James Bond in the film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, his eventual decision to leave the role, and the effect it all had on his career and the rest of his life. The film employs the use of re-enacted dramatizations of Lazenby's life interspersed with actual interview footage of him.
