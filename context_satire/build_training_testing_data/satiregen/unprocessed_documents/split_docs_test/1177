 Officials in West Texas said Monday they are investigating the "suspicious" death of a 3-year-old boy, adopted from Russia, and a Russian official blamed the death on "inhuman abuse." The boy was born on January 9, 2010, and died on January 21, 2013, according to Konstantin Dolgov, the Russian Foreign Ministry's special representative for human rights. "I would like to draw your attention to another case of inhuman abuse of a Russian child by U.S. adoptive parents," he said in a statement. Dolgov claimed the child suffered injuries to his head and legs, as well as to his abdomen and internal organs.  By the time Republican Sen. Ted Cruz arrived for an event at a gun manufacturing business outside Austin, there was a healthy-sized, cheering crowd to greet him. One constituent even held a handmade sign saying, "Ted Cruz Rocks." The scene had the look and feel of a campaign event. Except that the freshman senator isn't up for re-election for six years.  A Russian government child advocate said Wednesday he may have spoken too soon when he said a 3-year-old adopted boy who died in Texas was "killed" or "murdered." At a press conference Wednesday, Children's Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov said he tweeted those words based on the initial reports he received about the death. With the investigation still going, he's now simply saying the boy "died." Still he said, he wants his country to ban all international adoptions of Russian children.
