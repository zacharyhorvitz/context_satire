The award ceremony garnered criticism during the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards when Ellen Burstyn received a nomination for her work in Mrs. Harris (2005), despite having 14 seconds of screen time and 38 words of dialogue. This resulted in a rule change, requiring nominees submitting for the category to have more than 5% screen-time on their respective projects. Since its inception, the award has been given to 45 actresses. Patricia Arquette is the current recipient of the award for her portrayal of Dee Dee Blanchard on The Act. Valerie Bertinelli, Laura Dern, Faye Dunaway, and Polly Holliday have won the most awards in this category with two each. Rhea Perlman has been nominated for the award on six occasions, the most within the category.
