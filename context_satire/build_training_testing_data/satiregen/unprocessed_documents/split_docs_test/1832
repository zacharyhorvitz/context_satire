In 1997, Crayola released Crayons with Glitter as part of a Special Effects crayons package. Starting as late as 1999, their crayon names don't appear on the crayon wrappers. In the below list, the background represents crayon color, and the highlighted "square of glitter" around text represents glitter color. In 1997, Crayola released a 16-pack of Pearl Brite crayons: These were designed to give soft pearlescent colors. These had a new wrapper design, black with a white oval Crayola logo and white text. The 1970s saw the introduction of Crayola's first specialty crayons, eight fluorescent colors designed to glow under black light. These were never added to the No. 64 box, but were available separately or in a special box of 72 crayons, typically packaged with activity books or crayon stands. Fabric crayons were introduced in 1980, as the Crayola brand continued to expand beyond regular drawing crayons.
