Fillion was the 'face' of Complete Hero. The artist explained the choice of Fillion as follows: "I wanted to make a piece of work that looked at all kinds of heroism, not just the usual derring-do of white square-jawed men. But I thought it would be interesting to start with a white, square-jawed man and Nathan Fillion agreed to take part." Reynolds was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, and attended Matraville Sports High School. Andrew Johns, Matthew Johns and Darren Lockyer were his favourite players when he was a kid and Nathan Merritt is his favourite South Sydney player of all time. He then added when asked "who is the most inspirational player or person on your career and how have they positively affected your football? ", he responded "My brother â€“ he's always on my back telling me to do extras and pushing me to be the best I can be." Whedon approached Nathan Fillion to play the lead, and after explaining the premise and showing Fillion the treatment for the pilot, Fillion was eager for the role. Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast. He noted that "It was really thrilling. It was my first lead and I was pretty nervous, but I really wanted that part and I wanted to tell those stories."
