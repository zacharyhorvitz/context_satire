Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club wrote a positive review giving the series a "B+" grade. She observed that "What Weird Loners has in its corner is an appealing cast and some hard-hitting TV vets" and remarked that "Since  Kasdan and  Weithorn both know their way around a sitcom set, itâ€™s not a surprise that Weird Loners soon adds more gravity than most new shows boast from right out of the gate." Earlier in his television career Litt was a writer and producer on Ned and Stacy, a sit-com about a marriage of convenience. On this show he worked with Michael J. Weithorn (with whom he would later co-create The King of Queens) and Charlie Kaufman, the writer behind Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In 2014, Litt worked as co-executive producer on the Fox series titled Weird Loners, which premiered in March 2015. Ken Keeler came up with the idea for the episode from the one sentence statement: "Let's do spin-offs". His idea was to use intentionally bad writing and "crazy plots", which underlines their critique of spin-offs in general. After he had pitched the idea it was decided that "it was an idea that ought to work pretty well" and production went ahead. Creator Matt Groening was uneasy about the idea, feeling that it could be mistranslated as actually bad sitcom writing.
