Trump's comment sparked condemnation from various Democrats and Republicans for being perceived as suggesting violence against Clinton or liberal jurists, instead of suggesting political action. Clinton Campaign spokesman Robby Mook released a statement that said, "...Â what Trump is saying is dangerous", and that a person seeking the presidency "should not suggest violence in any way." General Michael Hayden, who is the former head of the CIA, stated that "If someone else had said that outside the hall, he'd be in the back of a police wagon now with the Secret Service questioning him." Secret Service spokesperson Cathy Milhoan said in a statement that the U.S. Secret Service was aware of Trump's comments. On September 22, shortly after the public had become aware of the existence of a whistleblower, Trump acknowledged that he had discussed Joe Biden during a call with Zelensky on July 25. Trump said, "The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to  the corruption already in Ukraine." Trump denied that his hold on military aid for Ukraine was linked to the Ukrainian government's refusal to investigate the Hunter Biden controversy, while also saying that withholding aid for this reason would have been ethically acceptable if he had done it. On September 26, 2019, Trump accused the person who provided the whistleblower with information of the call of being a "spy" and guilty of treason, before noting that treason is punishable by death.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday said there are 10 to 12 Senate Republicans "who know in their hearts" there should be witnesses and documents in President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial ahead of a looming vote later this week. The comments come after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, told his conference earlier Tuesday that the votes to shut out witnesses aren't there yet. But Senate Republicans are growing confident they can defeat a witness vote after weathering the fallout of revelations from former national security adviser John Bolton's draft book manuscript that Trump had told him US security assistance to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. "There are 10 to 12 Republicans who have never said a bad word about witnesses or documents, who know in their hearts it's the right thing to do.
