 On Tuesday night, US President Donald Trump revealed his nominee for the Supreme Court. Neil Gorsuch, a 49-year-old federal appellate judge from Colorado, is Trump's pick to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died suddenly last year. Gorsuch will likely face a blistering confirmation battle as Senate Democrats prepare to potentially filibuster Trump's nomination in the wake of successful Republican obstruction of President Obama's nominee last year. While the Supreme Court usually rules on domestic issues of national importance, some cases -- such as the 2000 Bush v. Gore decision on the rightful winner of the US election -- can have huge international ramifications.  President Donald Trump will nominate Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, Trump announced Tuesday night at the White House. The nomination of Gorsuch, a 49-year-old federal appellate judge from Colorado, gives Trump and Republicans the opportunity to confirm someone who could cement the conservative direction of the court for decades. Meet Neil Gorsuch: a fly-fishing Scalia fan His selection also sets up an intense fight with Senate Democrats, still angry over the Republicans' decision to essentially ignore former President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland for the empty Supreme Court seat last year. Introducing Gorsuch, Trump said he had committed as a candidate to "find the very best judge in the country for the Supreme Court." The appointment and confirmation of Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States involves several steps set forth by the United States Constitution, which have been further refined and developed by decades of tradition. Candidates are nominated by the President of the United States and must face a series of hearings in which both the nominee and other witnesses make statements and answer questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which can vote to send the nomination to the full United States Senate. Confirmation by the Senate allows the President to formally appoint the candidate to the court. The Constitution does not set any qualifications for service as a Justice, thus the President may nominate any individual to serve on the Court.
