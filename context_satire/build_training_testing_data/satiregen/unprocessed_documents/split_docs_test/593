 Sarah Sanders' primary legacy as White House press secretary will be the death of the daily press briefing. In her nearly two years as Trump's top liaison with the press, Sanders shortened the on-camera briefings and then did away with them altogether. Her most recent quarrel with the press in the briefing room was back on March 11 â€” and that session was only 14 minutes long. Now she is stepping down from her post, according to a tweet from President Trump on Thursday.  White House press secretary Sarah Sanders will leave her position at the end of the month, capping a tumultuous tenure as the President's chief spokeswoman in which she largely redefined the role. President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that Sanders will return to her home state of Arkansas and floated the possibility of a gubernatorial run for the White House press secretary. Speaking at an event later Thursday afternoon, Trump praised her as a "warrior." The descriptor reflected both the combative nature of Sanders' tenure and extent to which Trump has admired her pugnacity amid a fire hose of controversies.  There's nothing quite like the White House, but there's no place like home for departing White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. After more than three years with President Donald Trump, Sanders is leaving Washington to go back home to Arkansas. If the President has his way, Sanders will be the next governor of her state. Knowing Arkansas and Sanders as I do, I'd say the odds of that happening are ... bigly.
