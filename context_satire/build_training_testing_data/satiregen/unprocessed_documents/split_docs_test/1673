The 2010 Massachusetts Senate special election victory of Scott Brown seriously imperiled the prospects of a health care reform bill, as Democrats lost their 60-seat Senate super-majority. The White House and Speaker Nancy Pelosi engaged in an extensive campaign to convince both centrists and liberals in the House to pass the Senate's health care bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In March 2010, after Obama announced an executive order reinforcing the current law against spending federal funds for elective abortion services, the House passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The bill, which had passed the Senate in December 2009, did not receive a single Republican vote in either house. The Affordable Care Act faced considerable challenges and opposition after its passage, and Republicans continually attempted to repeal the law. The law also survived two major challenges that went to the Supreme Court. In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, a 5-4 majority upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, though it made state Medicaid expansion voluntary. In King v. Burwell, a 6-3 majority allowed the use of tax credits in state-operated exchanges.  If you're looking for a sign that this week is shaping up as a critical test of President Barack Obama's presidency, look no further than his schedule on Tuesday. In the morning, he'll make his fifth address to the United Nations General Assembly -- this time, with major diplomatic opportunities emerging in Syria and Iran. Later, his domestic agenda takes over when he turns again to former President Bill Clinton to explain Obamacare a week ahead of a critical date in its implementation. Obama's health care law is the source of contention in Washington, where Republicans voted to defund it -- for the 42nd time -- in return for keeping the government running.
