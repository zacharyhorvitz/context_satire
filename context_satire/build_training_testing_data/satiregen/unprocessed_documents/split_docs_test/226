The accompanying music video for "Everywhere" is a visual depiction of the poem The Highwayman by Alfred Noyes. There are two versions of the video; one features the story with members of the band appearing throughout, while the other does not feature the band at all. Cuffaro raised the money by taking out a loan and selling all of his furniture and half his guitar collection. He first filmed several scenes of a young actor, Eric Schubert, playing the part of Jeremy. Cuffaro and his crew spent a day filming Schubert playing the part of Jeremy. The scenes with Pearl Jam were filmed in a warehouse on Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. "Jeremy" was first performed live at the band's concert of May 17, 1991 in Seattle, Washington at the Off Ramp Caf√©. Pearl Jam performed the song for its appearance on MTV Unplugged in 1992. Pearl Jam also performed "Jeremy" at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1992. The band had intended to perform the Dead Boys song "Sonic Reducer", but MTV insisted that it play "Jeremy" since the song's music video was already in heavy rotation.
