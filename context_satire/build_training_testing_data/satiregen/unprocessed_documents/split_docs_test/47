On March 29, 2005, Chisholm released her first solo album, Expectancy, on the Entheos Records label. On this album she teamed up with songwriter/producer Carnell Murrell, Autun Foster, and Doreonne Stramler. Recorded live at the Cathedral Center in Detroit, the album's background vocals were supplied by a special assembly of vocalists, which included two of her children, Angel and Aaron Chisholm, as well as Lorenzo Clark, her sister Denise Clark-Bradford's son. The choir was directed by Bryon Stanfield. Gmail recognizes messages related by subject and groups them into "conversations" where messages in a back-and-forth string get collected together and appear stacked one after another, with the newest messages at the top. Any duplicated text is automatically concealed. The number of messages in a conversation always appears in parentheses next to the names of people in the conversation. A conversation will break off into a new thread if the subject line of a message is changed, or if the conversation reaches over 100 messages. Around 11:00Â pm EST March 31, 2008, on the newer and older version of Gmail, but not in the basic HTML version, in the upper right corner, next to Settings, a link appeared labeled, "New! Gmail Custom Time". The link led to a 404 error until April 1, when it led to the full Gmail Custom Time hoax page. Clicking any of the three links at the bottom of the page brought the user to a page stating that Gmail Custom time was, in fact, their April Fool's Day joke.
