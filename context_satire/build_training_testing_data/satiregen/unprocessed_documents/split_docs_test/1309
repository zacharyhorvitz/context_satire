Most of these models were the first BlackBerry models that had a built-in mobile phone, were the first models that natively ran Java, and transmitted data over the normal 2G cellular network. RIM began to advertise these devices as email-capable mobile phones rather than as two-way pagers. At this time, the primary market was still businesses rather than consumers. The 5810 was released on March 4, 2002. An aberration in this list, the 5790, was released at a much later date as a niche model in 2004 after many color BlackBerry models were out. This non-phone BlackBerry was made available due to the demand for a Java-based model that could run on the Mobitex data-only network. The 5810/5820 shared the same physical casing and keyboard layout as the earlier 957 device. After McClain's stint at As the World Turns concluded, rumors circulated about a return to All My Children. In December 2005, McClain made an appearance on the show, and her popular character returned full-time a few months later. In a surprising turn of events, the character of Dixie was killed off via poisoned pancakes on January 30, 2007, which caused a massive negative outcry from longtime fans and soap opera media. A front page headline on a Soap Opera Weekly cover story quoted McClain as saying, "There was no negotiation."
