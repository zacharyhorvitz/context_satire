  The Force is back. Big time. As the best Star Wars anything — film, TV show, video game, spinoff, what-have-you — in at least 32 years, Star Wars: The Force Awakens pumps new energy and life into a hallowed franchise in a way that both resurrects old pleasures and points in promising new directions. But whereas the fundamental touchstones of George Lucas' original creation remain, in director J.J. Abrams' hands there is a shift in tone that brings the material closer to the feel of a Steven Spielberg film.  The Force is back. Big time.

I have spent a good amount of my adult life trying to convince people that "Star Wars" is art. The seventh installment in the saga, "The Force Awakens," will help make that argument. To say the Force is with "The Force Awakens" would not only be a bad pun, but an understatement. The Disney film is full of the excitement, dread and joy that have been hallmarks of the franchise since the original film in 1977.
