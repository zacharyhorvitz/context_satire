Hales was born on May 20, 1990 in Ithaca, New York in a Mormon family but no longer practices the religion. His father, as a pharmaceutical salesman, moved their family from New York to New Hampshire and then to Bountiful. Although he grew up in multiple places, he calls Utah his home state. He also lived in Brookfield, Connecticut for a large part of his life and graduated Brookfield High School class of 2008 prior to attending Utah Valley University for 3 years. He had recently gotten a deal to write his next book and decided to write about Hans Reiser, a software guru who developed the Reiser filesystem. He had a volatile marriage and his wife has gone missing. Despite his claims that his wife has simply gone into hiding to hurt him, the cops arrested him for her murder and he is now on trial. Stephen is attending court every day and following the case, in hopes of writing a best seller. Hales has talked about how he was diagnosed with ADD many times and released a documentary video about Adderall on August 8, 2016. He mentioned he was prescribed Adderall about 6 months before he started his channel and said he has never seen the doctor who diagnosed him with ADD again. He also said that Adderall is the reason behind all his videos, but mentioned he doesn't want to talk about the subject because he doesn't take treatment any more.
