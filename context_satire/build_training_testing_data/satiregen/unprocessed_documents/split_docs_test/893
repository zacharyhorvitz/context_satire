West Hill High School was the name of two former schools in the neighbourhood of Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce (NDG) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The first West Hill High School was opened in 1919 by the Coteau St. Pierre School Commission on West Hill Avenue. It was annexed by the Protestant Board of School Commissioners (PBSC) in 1921. As NDG's population increased, the school was expanded in 1926 and 1931, and plans were announced for building a new high school in NDG.Construction of the new school was delayed by the Great Depression, World War II, and then the amalgamation of the PBSC into the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal in 1946. Gust has "the fondest memories" of the band, and he has stated that " view of the legacy of Heatmiser is those records. It was a great time in my life. It's been something that has paid off in my life over and over, far more than it ever paid at the time." Tony Lash also looks back on his time in Heatmiser favorably: "I have a lot of fond memories of that time. With Heatmiser in need of a bassist, a high school friend suggested Brandt Peterson to fill the position. Peterson had played in a few punk bands, but "was feeling ambivalent about another." Smith convinced him to join Heatmiser, at least until their February 14, 1992 live debut at Portland's X-Ray Cafe. Over the next few years, Heatmiser was a regular act at local Portland venues like the X-Ray Cafe, screenprinting shop Hand Prints, and La Luna, whose cheap, packed Monday night concerts were a hub for the city's twenty-something underground social scene.
