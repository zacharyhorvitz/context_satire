On February 14, 2014, JoS. A. Bank Clothiers announced plans to buy outdoor retailer Eddie Bauer in a $825 million deal. Men’s Wearhouse quickly filed a lawsuit to block the proposed deal, on the basis that it served only to make JoS. Although brands, JoS. A Bank and Men's Wearhouse, cater to similar audiences, they go by it differently. JAB features only its own collections by sourcing textiles worldwide and fabricating suits only for its own retail locations. Because of the process by which they compose their dress pants and jackets, most of them can be altered. Mark's (known as L'Équipeur in Quebec) is a Canadian clothing and footwear retailer specializing in casual and industrial wear. Beginning in 1977 as Mark’s Work Wearhouse in Calgary, Alberta, it evolved from an industrial accessories dealer to a men’s casual and industrial wear retailer. The company operates over 380 stores across Canada and has been a subsidiary of Canadian Tire since 2002. The company rebranded in 2012 as Mark’s in an effort to appeal to a wider customer base and reflect its expanded product offerings.
