KC Masterpiece was sold to the Kingsford division of Clorox in 1986 and now claims to be the number one premium barbecue brand in the U.S. When Davis sold the rights to his sauce to Kingsford, he announced plans to build a franchise of barbecue restaurants. The franchises were successful for a few years, but have since all closed. While Muschup and Dilled Muschup sold well, the barbecue sauce was the most popular selling 3,000 cases of it in Kansas City. He changed its name to KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce. In 1986, after ten years of success in the Kansas City area, Davis received an offer to sell the "K.C. Masterpiece" "Brand” to the Kingsford charcoal division of The HV Food Products Company (formally known as Hidden Valley Ranch Food Products, Inc.). HV Food Products Company operates as a subsidiary of The Clorox Company. Clorox’s intention was to market the sauce nationwide.
