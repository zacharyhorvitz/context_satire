After President Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice: "But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got."  American-based firms that use legal loopholes to avoid paying U.S. taxes have effectively renounced any allegiance to their home country, President Barack Obama will claim during remarks at a community college here on Thursday. Taking up a harsh new attack against companies that establish residency in tax havens like the Caymen Islands and Bermuda while keeping the bulk of their operations in the United States, Obama will call on Congress to mend a loophole allowing billions in tax revenue to slip through the government's fingers. A White House official, previewing Obama's remarks, said the President would make the case on Thursday that tax-avoiding companies "are essentially renouncing their American citizenship so that they can ship their profits overseas to avoid paying taxes -- even as they benefit from all the advantages of being here in America." The White House has aimed this week to advance the President's domestic agenda, focusing on jobs programs and the economy.  The Obama administration, after initially resisting the idea, is weighing whether to deploy National Guard troops to the southern border to help address a surge of migrant youth from Central America, many of them unaccompanied, a White House official told CNN. The Pentagon and the Department of Health and Human Services sent a team earlier this week to assess Border Patrol efforts in the Rio Grande Valley, the official said, where tens of thousands of children have poured into the United States this year. The administration's latest efforts in what most agree is a humanitarian crisis come as Washington struggles to address the matter with little optimism for a solution before Congress breaks for its month-long August recess.
