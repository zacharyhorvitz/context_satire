 For a while, it seemed that the threat from ISIS was limited to sparsely populated desert regions in the Middle East. Through brutal tactics and persecution of minorities, the Sunni extremist group brought slaughter and chaos to large areas of Syria and Iraq. But its merciless efforts to establish its version of an Islamic caliphate unsettled the wider region, prompting U.S. airstrikes aimed at stemming its advance. The Islamic militant group has responded by beheading three of its Western hostages in recent weeks, ratcheting up the crisis.  The head of a Syrian opposition group warns that military operations alone won't be enough to defeat terrorist groups like ISIS -- the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. "They cannot eliminate terrorism by only military operations. It has to be much, much more than military operations," Hadi al-Bahra, the president of the Syrian National Coalition, said on 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart." You have to have a social, political program.  Western allies vowed a tough fight against ISIS on Monday after the terrorist group called for attacks against those countries. "This call for the murder of civilians along with the execution of hostages and mass slaughters testifies once again, if necessary, of the terrorists' cruelty and justifies a tireless fight," French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said in a statement. "We are giving our law enforcement and security agencies the resources and legislative powers they need to keep Australia and Australians as safe as possible," the Australian Prime Minister's office said. The UK Home Office called the message "propaganda" and called for Internet providers to pull it down.
