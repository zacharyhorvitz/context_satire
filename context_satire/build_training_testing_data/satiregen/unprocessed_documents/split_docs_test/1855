 Matt Lauer was fired from NBC News on Wednesday after an employee filed a complaint about "inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace," the network announced. Savannah Guthrie made the announcement at the top of the "Today" show. "We are devastated," she said. Later in the day, Variety published a story containing additional sexual harassment allegations against Lauer.  A day after NBC announced his firing, Matt Lauer said Thursday that he is "truly sorry" for the pain he has caused. Lauer stands accused of sexual harassment by multiple women. At least three women have filed complaints with NBC. "There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions," Lauer said in a statement provided to CNN.  In September, Matt Lauer sat down with former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, who was ousted after he was accused of sexual harassment. "You were probably the last guy in the world that they wanted to fire, because you were the guy that the ratings and the revenues were built on," Lauer said. " ... You carried that network on your shoulders for a lot of years." Lauer, of course, was himself the long-time cornerstone of the "Today" show, one of the most profitable franchises on television.
