In what appeared to be a more modest escalation of threats against the United States and its allies in the region, North Korea announced Thursday it had tested out a new knife, conducting a series of trial cuts with the weapon that state media described as “a great success.” “The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has completed the development of a powerful new blade capable of traveling an entire arm’s length,” read a report from the Korean Central News Agency issued hours after U.S. satellite imagery confirmed researchers in a remote mountain region of the country had repeatedly thrown the knife end over end in an attempt to see if they could get it to stick in a tree trunk.
