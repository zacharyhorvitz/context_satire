In an effort to boost economic growth by encouraging recent college graduates to move to their city, Baltimore officials unveiled Tuesday a new advertising campaign targeting young professionals that centers on the tagline, “You get used to it.” “Most newcomers to Baltimore discover that, after a while, they are able to adjust their expectations to a point where they can live with what this place has to offer,” said Baltimore Development Corporation president William H. Cole IV, noting that the city boasts a few museums worth checking out and neighborhoods that begin to seem bustling and fun if one has lived there a couple years and has nothing better to compare them to.
