A senseless tragedy has left this small, close-knit community in the hill country of Texas reeling as they struggle to absorb the devastating news that beloved local drunk driver Chris Dehaene, 41, died in a head-on highway collision Tuesday evening.Dehaene, a fixture in the community whose irrepressible enthusiasm for drinking and driving endeared him to all those who knew him, died doing what he loved best: operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.Two local high school children also perished in the accident, while a third was permanently paralyzed.“I still can’t believe Chris is gone,” said Libby Paulson, 25, a convenience store clerk who mentioned that she often sold Dehaene liquor before he went driving.
