Citing a whirlwind month and a half in which he leaked classified details of a massive government surveillance operation, secretly fled from the United States to Hong Kong, and became a figure of national and global intrigue, sources confirmed Thursday that the life of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden is just straight-up fun, exciting, and full of action.Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia after exposing the NSA’s PRISM data-mining program—which reports indicate is pretty much straight out of a goddamn  movie—appears to have successfully evaded U.S. authorities attempting to extradite him on federal charges, in what many agree is as cool as it sounds.Sources also verified that the 30-year-old’s life is sure as hell a lot more interesting and eventful than pretty much anyone else’s right now, no question about that.“First, he spies on people as part of a top-secret government program, and if that wasn’t crazy enough, he then blows the lid on the whole operation and goes into hiding in Hong Kong,” said 34-year-old actuary Jason Leavitt of Kinston, NC.
