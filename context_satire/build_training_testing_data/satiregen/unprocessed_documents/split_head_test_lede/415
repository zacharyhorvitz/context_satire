Admitting their agency has exhausted every other viable option for putting jobless Americans back to work, resigned officials from the U.S. Department of Labor announced plans Thursday to try giving every unemployed citizen a self-serve frozen yogurt shop to own and operate.Labor Secretary Thomas Perez claimed the department’s previous efforts, including unemployment benefits and occupational training programs, had failed to significantly improve the nation’s job market over the past six years, and stated that their new yogurt-based initiative was, at this point, the best way to help those who remain out of work.
