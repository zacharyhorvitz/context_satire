According to a study published this week by the University of Minnesota’s Institute of Linguistics, the majority of statements made in the United States today are prefaced by the phrase “In light of recent events.” “Our survey of American speech patterns found that 71 percent of all utterances now start with some variation of the words ‘Given what occurred earlier today,’ or, slightly more rarely, ‘Based on what we know at this point,’” said the report’s author, Karen Sodhi, who added that nearly four in five of these remarks begin with the speaker taking a deep breath and then pausing for a moment to gather themselves before talking aloud.
