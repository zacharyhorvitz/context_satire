In a gesture of encouragement toward the millions of Americans struggling to find work in a difficult job market, the U.S. Department of Labor told employment seekers today not to forget about the tons of dumbfucks out there.Speaking at a morning press conference, department officials stressed that while there are still many more job applicants than job openings, those in need of work should take comfort in the knowledge that the pool of available labor in the United States includes all kinds of dimwits, morons, and complete fucking imbeciles.“If you’re unemployed and applying for work, it’s important to remember that most of the candidates you’re up against are stupid as shit,” said Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, urging out-of-work Americans to stop a moment and consider just how many of their fellow citizens are drooling idiots who don’t have a goddamn clue about anything.
