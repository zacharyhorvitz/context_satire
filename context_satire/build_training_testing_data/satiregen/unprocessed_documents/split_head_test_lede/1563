Anticipating that it will serve as a springboard for the formation of new friendships, DePauw University freshman Andrew Russett said Tuesday that leaving his dorm room door open will be a central component of his social strategy.Russett, 18, told reporters that a door left casually ajar will be a clear signal to other students on his floor that the room’s occupant is both welcoming and easygoing.“Everyone’s trying to meet people during the first week of school, and when they see my door open, they’ll probably want to poke their head in and see what’s up,” Russett said, adding that propping the door open about halfway would give people a glimpse of only about half his room, leaving them intrigued enough to find out more.
