After waiting for the cheers and loud chants of his name to die down, Donald Trump reportedly began his headlining speech Thursday night at the Republican National Convention by taking a moment to remind the members of his party this was their final opportunity to get out of this thing before it went any further.Trump, who stepped onto the stage to officially accept his party’s nomination amid tremendous fanfare, opened his remarks by making it clear that the American people’s last chance to back out of this whole situation had arrived, and that if they did not bow out now, they would be in it with him until the very end.“Good evening, everybody, and thank you very much—wow, what an incredible night,” said Trump, addressing a frenzied crowd of 20,000 in Quicken Loans Arena and millions of additional viewers watching on television and online.
