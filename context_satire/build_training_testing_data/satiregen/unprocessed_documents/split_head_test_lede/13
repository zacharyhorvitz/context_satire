Hoping to avoid any association with a country whose approval rating has hit an all-time low among voters, the entire field of 2014 midterm congressional candidates is actively working to distance themselves from the United States, sources confirmed Wednesday.In the run up to Election Day, reports indicate that every person campaigning in one of the 36 U.S. Senate or 435 House races is now treating any perceived affiliation with the country as a major political liability—and they’re moving quickly to sever all remaining ties.“When voters head to the polls on Nov. 4, they should understand that a vote for me is not a vote for the United States,” said Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA), responding to repeated accusations from her opponent that she was once close with the country.
