It’s an honest-to-god redemption story: After admitting to friends and family that he had developed a serious problem, 32-year-old gaming addict Trevor Osborne revealed this week that he was trying to slowly wean himself off of real life.“Clearly, I’ve gotten into this place where I’m overly dependent on reality and it’s really starting to harm the relationships I have with my clan members,” said Osborne, who told reporters that he regularly spends 15 hours in one sitting playing , saying that he would try cutting back to an hour or two of real life per day to stem his self-destructive need to engage with the outside world.
