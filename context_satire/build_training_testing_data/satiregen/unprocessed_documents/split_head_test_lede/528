Saying it was one of the few times the elected official had opted to show his face in the area all year, disheartened constituents of Iowa's 1st Congressional District confirmed that, during a charity event Wednesday, deadbeat U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley (D-IA) had finally decided to spend some actual quality time with them.According to constituents, Braley has hardly been a part of their lives at all since he entered office in 2007, choosing instead to spend most of his time in Washington or "God knows where else," and only occasionally returning home for short, obligatory visits during holidays or around campaign season when he needs a favor.
