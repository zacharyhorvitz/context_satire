Voicing their calls for heavy distortion and completely badass riffs, millions of Americans across the country fervently demanded a significant increase in the number of mind-blowing guitar solos Monday, sources nationwide confirmed.Highlighting an unmistakable dearth of epic, amazing solos in recent years, Americans of all ages have reportedly called on the nation’s musicians to play technically difficult licks on their electric guitars, preferably at lightning-fast speeds, stressing the importance that the solos be both “loud as hell” and “totally insane.”“When I turn on the radio, I want to hear a killer solo where the guy just totally shreds it hard,” said 36-year-old Kent, WA resident Michael Pellone, echoing the sentiments of the vast majority of citizens from coast to coast.
