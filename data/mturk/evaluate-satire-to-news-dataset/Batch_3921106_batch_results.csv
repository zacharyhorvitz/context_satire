Will that be the case at Fox News? The network won't say. Hannity was revealed on Monday as the third mystery client who had received legal services in the past year from Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's personal attorney.","Fox News 'surprised' by Hannity's relationship with Cohen, but stands by him","Something isn't adding up in the case of Michael Cohen and Sean Hannity. But Hannity's employer, Fox News, says it fully supports him. ""While Fox News was unaware of Sean Hannity's informal relationship with Michael Cohen and was surprised by the announcement in court yesterday, we have reviewed the matter and spoken to Sean and he continues to have our full support,"" the network said Tuesday afternoon. The statement puts an end to questions about whether the network knew about Hannity and Cohen's legal relationship.","Will Sean Hannity face disciplinary action over Michael Cohen? Fox News isn't saying","At most news organizations, Sean Hannity would face disciplinary action for having concealed a glaring conflict of interest from his viewers. Will that be the case at Fox News? The network won't say. Hannity was revealed on Monday as the third mystery client who had received legal services in the past year from Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's personal attorney.","Sean Hannity news is a real problem for Michael Cohen","Fox host Sean Hannity just helped the government's case against President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, tremendously. Even irony itself was not prepared for that development. Courtroom drama peaked Monday at a hearing in lower Manhattan when Michael Cohen's lawyer, Stephen Ryan, reluctantly revealed to Judge Kimba Wood -- a judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York -- that Cohen's mystery third client was Hannity, the bombastic, unconditional champion of citizen-turned-candidate-turned-President, Donald Trump. But the shock of that third-client revelation paled in comparison to Hannity's shocking denial, soon after, that he and Michael Cohen were ever in an attorney-client relationship.","{}","1","1","1","1","1","{}","1","1","1","1","1","{}","1","1","1","1","1"

The lead Clinton enjoyed for months in swing state and national polls has all but evaporated, raising the stakes for the first debate.
