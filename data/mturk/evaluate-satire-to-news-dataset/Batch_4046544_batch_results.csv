Englishness is often a response to different national identities within Britain such as Scottishness, Irishness, Welshness and Cornishness.Sometimes Englishness is thought to be encapsulated in terms of a particular relation to sport: ""fair play,"" for instance.

[354] At the end of the 20th century, there was a renewed interest in 13th-century English history, resulting in the publication of various specialist works on aspects of Henry's reign, including government finance and the period of his minority. [7] Current historiography notes both Henry's positive and negative qualities: historian David Carpenter judges him to have been a decent man, who failed as a ruler because of his naivety and inability to produce realistic plans for reform, a theme echoed by Huw Ridgeway, who also notes his unworldliness and inability to manage his court, but who considers him to have been ""essentially a man of peace, kind and merciful"".","{}","0","1","0","0","0","{}","0","1","0","1","1","{}","1","0","0","0","1"

The Nixon Foundation sought to distance itself Friday from Stone after the political provocateur emerged from a Florida federal courthouse flashing the signature double V hand signal, usually used to symbolize ""victory"" or ""peace,"" that Nixon made when he departed the White House after his resignation. Stone, who has a tattoo of the former president on his back, has long cited Nixon as a key political icon and influence.","Roger Stone must have made Mueller really angry","In a dramatic predawn raid, FBI agents placed Roger Stone, the Republican king of darkness under arrest at his Florida home on charges related to the Robert Mueller investigation. The televised raid looked like one designed to apprehend a terrorist rather than the pajama-clad 66-year-old Trump campaign advisor renowned for his ""dirty tricks"" approach to presidential campaigns and the large Richard Nixon tattoo adorning his back. The aggressive raid suggests that it might be time to trade in the Nixon tattoo for a bullseye, especially given the ferocity of the arrest tactics employed by Mueller's FBI agents.","Roger Stone indicted","Our live coverage has ended. Scroll through the posts below or read more about Roger Stone's indictment here. Roger Stone just spoke outside of the federal courthouse where he appeared a short time ago in Florida.He proclaimed his innocence, said he is falsely accused and finds the tactics this morning at his house disturbing.","Roger Stone enters not guilty plea","Roger Stone, a longtime Republican campaign adviser and confidant of President Donald Trump, pleaded not guilty Tuesday morning to seven criminal charges of false statements, witness tampering and obstruction of justice. Special counsel Robert Mueller and the US attorney for the District of Columbia have accused Stone of lying to congressional investigators about his communications regarding WikiLeaks' publication of stolen emails meant to damage Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016. In one charge, he is accused of threatening a contact of his whose congressional testimony about WikiLeaks would contradict Stone's.","How CNN captured video of the Roger Stone raid","The rare, dramatic video from CNN Friday capturing the early morning FBI raid of longtime Donald Trump confidante Roger Stone's Florida home was the product of good instincts, some key clues, more than a year of observing comings at the DC federal courthouse and the special counsel's office -- and a little luck on the timing.

Towards the end, Diaz did close to nothing, leaning against the ropes.

Noting al-Assad's forces have been helped by Hezbollah in Lebanon as well as Iran, Carney said Syrian rebels need the help of the United States and allied nations to withstand an increased assault.","Wikipedia","Assad de-radicalised the Ba'ath government when he took power by giving more space to private property and by strengthening the country's foreign relations with countries which his predecessor had deemed reactionary. He sided with the Soviet Union during the Cold War in turn for support against Israel, and, while he had forsaken the pan-Arab concept of unifying the Arab world into one Arab nation, he sought to make Syria the defender of Arab interests against Israel. When he came to power, Assad organised state services along sectarian lines (the Sunnis became the heads of political institutions, while the Alawites took control of the military, intelligence, and security apparatuses).","Hezbollah slams EU's blacklisting of its military arm","Hezbollah denounced the European Union's decision to list its military wing as a terrorist organization, calling the move ""aggressive and imbalanced."" The Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite group is already viewed as a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel. In recent months, it has joined forces with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in that country's ongoing civil war.","Wikipedia","During its decades of rule... the Assad family developed a strong political safety net by firmly integrating the military into the government. In 1970, Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father, seized power after rising through the ranks of the Syrian armed forces, during which time he established a network of loyal Alawites by installing them in key posts. In fact, the military, ruling elite, and ruthless secret police are so intertwined that it is now impossible to separate the Assad government from the security establishment.","Pope Francis Crushes Small Demon Crawling Across Papal Apartment Floor","VATICAN CITYSaying the wicked little creature had probably crept out of some crack that led to Hell, Pope Francis reportedly crushed a small demon beneath his shoe Friday as it crawled across his papal apartment floor.","Wikipedia","As pope, his manner is less formal than that of his immediate predecessors: a style that news coverage has referred to as ""no frills"", noting that it is ""his common touch and accessibility that is proving the greatest inspiration.

[52][53][54]  He explained that, as it was becoming clear during the conclave voting that he would be elected the new bishop of Rome, the Brazilian Cardinal Cludio Hummes had embraced him and whispered, ""Don't forget the poor"", which had made Bergoglio think of the saint. [55][56]  Bergoglio had previously expressed his admiration for St. Francis, explaining that He brought to Christianity an idea of poverty against the luxury, pride, vanity of the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the time.","Wikipedia","Instead of accepting his cardinals' congratulations while seated on the papal throne, Francis received them standing, reportedly an immediate sign of a changing approach to formalities at the Vatican. [146] During his first appearance as pontiff on the balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica, he wore a white cassock, not the red, ermine-trimmed mozzetta[146][147] used by previous popes. [148] He also wore the same iron pectoral cross that he had worn as archbishop of Buenos Aires, rather than the gold one worn by his predecessors.","Wikipedia","On a pilgrimage to Rome, he joined the poor in begging at St. Peter's Basilica. [14] He spent some time in lonely places, asking God for spiritual enlightenment. He said he had a mystical vision of Jesus Christ in the forsaken country chapel of San Damiano, just outside Assisi, in which the Icon of Christ Crucified said to him, ""Francis, Francis, go and repair My house which, as you can see, is falling into ruins.""","Wikipedia","In March 2018, Francis was quoted in la Repubblica as saying (in Italian) ""Those who repent obtain Gods forgiveness and take their place among the ranks of those who contemplate him, but those who do not repent and cannot be forgiven disappear. A hell doesnt exist, the disappearance of sinning souls exists"". The Vatican quickly called this a reconstruction by Eugenio Scalfari rather than a faithful transcription of Francis's words.","{}","1","0","0","1","0","{}","0","0","0","1","0","{}","0","0","0","0","1"

The move comes as an attorney for Cohen openly questioned Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani's claim that the tape showed no wrongdoing by the President, furthering the growing divide between Trump and Cohen, who had once said he'd take a bullet for the President.

In addition, many of the words carry both geographical and political connotations which are affected by the history of the islands.The purpose of this article is to explain the meanings of and relationships among the terms in use; however many of these classifications are contentious and are the subject of disagreement (See the British Isles naming dispute).","Wikipedia","The British people, or Britons, are the citizens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the British Overseas Territories, and the Crown dependencies. British nationality law governs modern British citizenship and nationality, which can be acquired, for instance, by descent from British nationals. When used in a historical context, ""British"" or ""Britons"" can refer to the Celtic Britons, the indigenous inhabitants of Great Britain and Brittany, whose surviving members are the modern Welsh people, Cornish people, and Bretons.","{}","0","0","0","0","0","{}","0","0","0","1","0","{}","1","0","0","0","1"
