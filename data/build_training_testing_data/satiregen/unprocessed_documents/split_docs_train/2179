On September 1, 2010, North American production of the Santa Fe shifted to Kia's new West Point, Georgia assembly plant for the 2011 model year. This was done to free up production capacity at the Alabama plant for the new Sonata and new Elantra. The Santa Fe fills the void left for a Kia-built Hyundai sold in the United States & Canada after Hyundai ended production of the Entourage minivan in 2009. Kia, however, is 49.2% owned by Hyundai. In Europe, this model was heavily promoted by the motoring press, and even Hyundai themselves, as a "stopgap" model – that it was intended merely to plug the gap in Hyundai's range until a brand new small family car was launched in 2007. The new car, the Hyundai i30, replaced both the Accent and the larger Hyundai Elantra. The name change helped to distance the new model from the budget reputation of the Accent, and also to highlight that the new car can truly compete in the small family hatchback sector – something the Accent was slightly too small to do, and the Elantra too large. The Accent continued to be sold in the U.S. in 2008 with an instrument panel overhaul and standard rear cupholders in the SE model. Due to the lack of right-hand-drive 5th generation Accent production in Korea, Hyundai is set to phase the Accent nameplate out of Australia once all stock is exhausted by the end of 2019. The all-new Hyundai Venue, Hyundai's new small SUV, is set to indirectly replace it.
