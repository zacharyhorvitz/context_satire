 Less than 48 hours before primaries in Arizona and Michigan, Mitt Romney received a key endorsement from Arizona's governor Sunday while his current main challenger, Rick Santorum, appeared to downplay his own chances of winning in the Grand Canyon State. The two are leading the pack in the Republican presidential campaign that includes former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul as it heads into a series of crucial contests in coming weeks, including Super Tuesday on March 6 when 437 delegates from 10 states will be at stake. Michigan is emerging as a showdown between Romney and Santorum, with the outcome expected to significantly impact the campaign. If Romney comes from behind in the polls to win the state considered home turf where his father was governor, he will cement his status as the lone front-runner and presumptive nominee.  Mitt Romney got more good delegate news Thursday as the Republican presidential campaign headed toward next week's Super Tuesday showdown, with one candidate acknowledging he needs a victory to keep his campaign alive. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, campaigning in Atlanta ahead of the Georgia primary on March 6, made it clear he has to win the state he represented in Congress. "I have to win Georgia, I think, to be credible in the race," said Gingrich, who has won only one primary so far, in neighboring South Carolina. Gingrich is vying with former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum to be the conservative alternative to the more moderate Romney in the race for the Republican nomination to face President Barack Obama in November.  Rick Santorum put a positive spin on his disappointing loss in Michigan, saying "we feel great" about the results as the focus shifts to Super Tuesday contests. "This was going to be  Romney's night. The question was how big. And it wasn't very big," Santorum said in a reference to Mitt Romney, who had a home-state advantage in Michigan.
