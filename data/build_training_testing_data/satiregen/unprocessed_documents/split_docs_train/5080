 Observers have been worrying about heightened tensions at Donald Trump rallies for while, and now they're turning violent. On Wednesday night, a Trump supporter sucker-punched an African-American protester as he was being escorted out of a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Last month, a Secret Service agent choke-slammed a Time Magazine photographer after he left the media pen to photograph a group of protesters. And at Trump press conference on Tuesday night, a Breitbart News reporter was reportedly yanked by the arm by Trump's campaign manager (though the campaign disputes that account).  Bernie Sanders on Sunday slammed GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump over comments the Vermont senator said "encourage violence." "A candidate for president of the United States should condemn violence, not encourage violence," the Democratic White House hopeful said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio. "You don't go around and say it's okay to beat somebody up and then pay the legal fees. That's not what this country is about," Sanders said just hours before he was set to take the stage for the Sunday night CNN Democratic town hall.  House Speaker Paul Ryan is standing behind his pledge to support whoever becomes the Republican nominee for president a day after condemning the violence at Donald Trump's rallies. "My position hasn't changed on that," Ryan told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Ryan's criticism about the tone at Trump's political events in a radio interview on Monday was the third time he has singled out the Republican presidential front-runner for actions he believed could damage the party. But the speaker, who is effectively the face of his party until it coalesces around a nominee, argued his ability to impact the presidential race was limited.
