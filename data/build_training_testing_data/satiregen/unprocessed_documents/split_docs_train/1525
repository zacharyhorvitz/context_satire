 While both campaigns have been lowering expectations ahead of Wednesday's first presidential debate, two of Mitt Romney's more notable surrogates raised the bar on Sunday, with one predicting Romney will turn the race "upside down." Both New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. John McCain said they expect Romney to shine when he shares the Denver stage for the first time with President Barack Obama. "We have a candidate who is going to do extraordinarily well on Wednesday night," Chris Christie said on "Face the Nation" on CBS.  Mitt Romney seems to be undergoing an extreme makeover -- presidential candidate edition. A few months ago he told donors at a Florida fundraiser that he'd never convince the 47% of Americans who he described as government-dependent shoo-ins for President Barack Obama to "take personal responsibility and care for their lives." In the ensuing firestorm, he admitted his comments were "not elegantly stated," but defended the main point of his message, saying he was criticizing the increasing size of government and entitlement programs. On Thursday during a FOX News interview, he said he was wrong.  President Barack Obama turned in a less-than-stellar performance Wednesday night in his first debate this election season. On Thursday, his campaign aides said former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney came armed with distortions. But if the president believed that, he barely brought them to the viewers' attention during the debate.
