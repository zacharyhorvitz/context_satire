Care and feeding of the bears, however, still fell to the Knight family and friends. It wasn't long before Knight addressed the city council again regarding the bears. Just five months later, he offered to donate the bears, along with their cages, to the city. Portland City Council accepted his offer on November 7, 1888, and thus began the Portland Zoo. The Oregon Zoo was founded in 1888, making it the oldest North American zoo west of the Mississippi. It all began with two bears purchased by Richard Knight â€“ one brown bear and one grizzly. A former seaman turned pharmacist, Knight began collecting animals from his seafaring friends. He kept his collection in the back of his drug store on Third & Morrison streets. On July 4, 1970, three men broke into the zoo at night. One of the three was killed by the zoo's two lions while he was showing off by lowering himself over the lion pit. The next night, one of the men broke into the zoo again and shot both of the zoo's lions. The incident stirred a public outcry against the men, including the victim of the mauling.
