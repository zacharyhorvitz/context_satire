 President Donald Trump on Friday upended his long-stated goal of returning American astronauts to the moon by the end of a potential second term, instead saying his federal space agency should focus instead on the further reaches of space. "For all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon - We did that 50 years ago," he wrote on Twitter as he jetted back to Washington from Ireland. "They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science!" Trump wrote.  Three small companies that built robotic lunar landers are getting big business from NASA. Texas-based Intuitive Machines, Astrobotic of Pittsburgh, and a group called OrbitBeyond were each selected by NASA to deliver science and research cargo to the moon. The companies could complete their first missions within the next couple of years, executives and NASA officials said Friday. The cargo will include devices that will help map and navigate the lunar surface, measure radiation levels, conduct scientific investigations, and assess how human activity impacts the moon, NASA said in a press release.
