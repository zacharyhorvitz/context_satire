Spearheaded by Michael Conn (a history teacher at Milton High School), the members of Team Cambodia, a group dedicated to raising money to build a school in the Kampong Cham province of Cambodia, and the majority of the student body raised over $30,000. The school is completed and is now in service. Students and faculty members of the Milton School District recently completed a trip to Cambodia to check in and report back to the community on the success of the endeavor. Appointed in 1986 as the Executive Director of the En'owkin Centre, Armstrong continues to serve in that position. In 1989 she helped to establish the En'owkin School of International Writing and became its director, as well as an instructor (Petrone 140). It is the first creative writing school in Canada to award credit that is operated entirely by and for Aboriginal people (Petrone 140 and Voices). In the initial years following her divorce, Brant worked any unskilled job she could to support her three children, including working as a salesclerk, waitress, and cleaner. Her writing came later in her life at the age of forty when she had a monumental experience on a trip through the Mohawk reservation with Dorsz. An eagle flew in front of their car window while she was driving. The eagle landed on a nearby tree and Brant stopped the car to bear witness at the creature.
