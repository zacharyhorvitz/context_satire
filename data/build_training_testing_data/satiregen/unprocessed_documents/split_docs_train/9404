Since the appointment of Thomas R. Insel as Director of NIMH in 2002, the institute has undergone organizational changes to better target mental health research needs (the expansion from three extramural divisions to five divisions, with the two new divisions focusing on adult and child translational research). NIMH also weathered several years of controversy due to conflict of interest and ethics violations by some of its intramural investigators. This situation cast light on an area that affected all of NIH, and resulted in more stringent rules about conflict of interest for all of NIH. Recently, Congressional interest turned to ethics and conflict of interest concerns with external investigators who receive NIMH or other NIH support.  South Korean officials announced one more death in the country's MERS outbreak Friday, raising the total death toll to 24. One new case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was also announced, bringing the total number to 166, according to South Korea's Ministry of Health. The number of people under quarantine in South Korea, both in their own homes or in quarantine facilities, declined from 6,729 to 5,930 The World Health Organization described the MERS outbreak as a "wakeup call," showing that outbreaks can happen anywhere. The WHO has said that the number of new cases "appears to be declining" -- indicating that the outbreak could be slowing down. In 1887, a laboratory for the study of bacteria, the Hygienic Laboratory, was established at the Marine Hospital in New York. In the early 1900s, Congress began appropriating funds for the Marine Hospital Service. By 1922, this organization changed its name to Public Health Services and established a Special Cancer Investigations laboratory at Harvard Medical School. This marked the beginning of a partnership with universities.
