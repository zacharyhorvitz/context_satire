Booth had assembled his entire team—which consisted of John Surratt, Lewis Powell, Samuel Arnold, George Atzerodt, David Herold, and Michael O'Laughlen—because he wanted the men to plan to kidnap Lincoln the next time he attended a play at Ford's Theatre. Booth rented the President's Box at the theater on March 15, and he provided tickets to Powell and Surratt so that they could familiarize themselves with the layout of the theater and how to access the box. The two attended the theater as planned – in the company of two of Mary's female boarders. This list is sorted by game titles, their developer(s), publisher(s), released for and release date by Japanese, European, Australian, and American regions respectively. A game title without a region abbreviation in superior letters is a North American title and may be shared in another region if there is no secondary title with a matching region in superior letters.
