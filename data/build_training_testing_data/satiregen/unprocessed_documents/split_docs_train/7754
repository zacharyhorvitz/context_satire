In April 2019, Uber scientist Raquel Urtasun offered a more cautious estimate of the companyâ€™s eventual self-driving capabilities, saying "self-driving cars are going to be in our lives. The question of when is not clear yet. To have it at scale is going to take a long time."  Uber, long criticized for its handling of drivers, is taking a serious step toward boosting their incentives. On Thursday, the company announced Uber Pro, a driver loyalty program that offers perks ranging from extra pay and free online education to dent repair and gas discounts. The program may help retain drivers, who often quit within a few months, research shows. Uber's drivers are independent contractors so they do not receive benefits such as health care or tuition reimbursement.  Millions of people across the country are heading out to vote today, and some major transportation providers are helping them get there. Here are some of the ways ride-share services and public transportation lines are helping voters exercise their rights. Lyft is offering 50% off codes through Vote.org and other voting nonprofits. They're also partnering with other nonprofits to give free rides to voters in underserved communities.
