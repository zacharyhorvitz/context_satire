 As he was handily winning three Republican contests and stalling frontrunner Mitt Romney's clear path to the Republican presidential nomination, Rick Santorum proclaimed to CNN that the 2012 GOP race was now "in a little bit of no man's land." The former Pennsylvania senator's campaign got a massive dose of momentum after stunning frontrunner Mitt Romney with a clean sweep on Tuesday night, beating him by double digits in Minnesota, a state Romney won in 2008; stunning him in Colorado, another state in Romney's column in 2008; and trouncing him in Missouri, one of the country's biggest battleground states. "I don't stand here to claim to be the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney," Santorum told supporters in a convention hall just west of St. Louis. "I stand here to be the conservative alternative to Barack Obama." Another of the top-three-polling Republican presidential candidates, Ron Paul, who routinely criticizes Bernanke and has made "End the Fed" a major platform issue, also criticized Perry's comment, saying that "he makes me look like a moderate" and that, unlike Perry, "I have never once said Bernanke has committed treason."  It's "lull week" in the Republican presidential campaign, an 11-day stretch with no primaries or caucuses and no debates, but lots of questions about who will eventually win the nomination to face President Barack Obama in November. The topsy-turvy race has seen leaders come and go, with presumptive frontrunner Mitt Romney receiving steady but so far somewhat stagnant support in his second bid for the GOP nod. Conservative challenger Rick Santorum upended the process last week by winning all three contests on Tuesday to boost his chances and reshape the competition. However, Romney regained some luster Saturday by winning both the Maine caucuses and a straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering of the political right.
