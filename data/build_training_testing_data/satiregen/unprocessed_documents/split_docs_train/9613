 Benjamin Netanyahu was on course to secure a record fifth term as Israeli Prime Minister after his main election rival conceded defeat on Wednesday evening. After a dramatic finish to a tightly-fought race, former army chief Benny Gantz accepted that Netanyahu had won. "We are all democratic, we all accept the decision of the nation," Gantz said. With more than 97% of the vote counted, according to Israeli media, a bloc led by Netanyahu's Likud party would secure 65 seats in the 120-strong Knesset.  President Donald Trump is celebrating Benjamin Netanyahu's Israeli election victory like it's his own -- and in many ways, it is. Trump and his foreign policy team orchestrated one of the most undisguised US interventions in an election abroad of recent times, helping to win the Israeli Prime Minister a fifth term. Now he's claiming some of the spoils. "Trump flags being waived at the Bibi @Netanyahu VICTORY celebration last night!"  Israelis are voting in a closely watched general election on Tuesday, seen here as a referendum on Benjamin Netanyahu. On March 31, Netanyahu marked ten uninterrupted years as Israel's Prime Minister, in addition to the three years he led the country in the 1990s, and there is little doubt that he's won a place in the A-list of world leaders; for a man leading a country of fewer than nine million people, his clout and recognition are a remarkable achievement. But at home he has become a highly polarizing figure, inspiring devotion and revulsion in equal measure. Netanyahu has fought this election in the face of looming indictments for bribery and breach of trust offences.
