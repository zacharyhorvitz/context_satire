Steve Jobs contacted Burns to obtain the filmmaker's permission to use the term "Ken Burns Effect" for Apple's video production software (the description had been Apple's internal working title while the feature was in development). Burns initially declined, saying that he did not allow his name to be used for commercial purposes. Instead, Burns had Jobs give him "some equipment which we give to nonprofits" in exchange for permission to use the term in Apple products. Ken Burns and I decided to remaster The Civil War for several reasons. First of all when we completed the film in 1989, we were operating under a very tight schedule and budget. As the main editor on the film, I always wanted to go back and improve the overall quality of the film. The other reason for remastering the film at this time is that the technology to color correct, print and transfer a film to video for broadcast has vastly improved, especially in the realm of digital computer technology... We also were able to eliminate a great deal of the dust and dirt that often get embedded into 16mm film when it is printed.  There's no better time to be born in Cleveland, where the Indians are seeking their first World Series title since 1948. Just ask the families of the little sluggers born this week in Cleveland Clinic's Fairview Hospital. The world-famous hospital is getting into the spirit by bundling newborns in Cleveland Indians onesies for the duration of the championship. Hopefully, none of them are Chicago Cubs fans.
