Today the Senate Republican Conference assists Republican Senators by providing a full range of communications services including graphics, radio, television, and the Internet. Its current Chairman is Senator John Barrasso, and its Vice Chairwoman is currently Senator Joni Ernst. At the time of his temporary appointment to the U.S. Senate for Wyoming in 2007, Barrasso was quoted as saying on his application: "I believe in limited government, lower taxes, less spending, traditional family values, local control and a strong national defense"; he also said that he had "voted for prayer in schools, against gay marriage and  sponsored legislation to protect the sanctity of life".
