 The Austin bomber showed no remorse in a 25-minute "matter-of-fact" confession video that he recorded hours before he blew himself up, Texas Rep. Michael McCaul said. Mark Anthony Conditt, 23, planted a series of explosive devices in the state capital, killing two people and terrorizing the city for 19 days this month. On Wednesday, he ended his deadly spree after he detonated one of his homemade devices inside his SUV. Since then, more details have emerged about the bomber, the type of bombs he used and how he was finally cornered.  Mark Anthony Conditt's family said they home-schooled him and worked hard to raise him right. But authorities said he was a "very challenged young man," who confessed to building and setting off a series of bombs that terrorized central Texas for three weeks. The Austin serial bomber killed himself when he detonated one of his bombs early Wednesday. He was responsible for six other devices, five of which detonated, killing two people and injuring five others.  The Austin, Texas, serial bomber, 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt, was, according to Austin Police Chief Brian Manley, a "very troubled young man." By every measure of investigative and tactical resolution metrics, Manley and his department did a masterful job of working closely with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- more commonly known as ATF -- to identify and track down the diabolical mastermind of six detonated devices that killed two people, in addition to himself, and injured five. Yet many have criticized Manley's genteel and ostensibly well-intentioned description of the bomber, who began his reign of terror with targeted bomb package deliveries in largely minority neighborhoods. Police have recovered an apparent cellphone "confession" following a dramatic confrontation with the killer that resulted in him initiating an explosive device that took his life and injured a SWAT operator.
