 After a heated presidential debate late Wednesday, Mark McKinnon, contributor to The Daily Beast and former McCain campaign adviser, weighs in on “Starting Point.”  McKinnon argues that the debate was the most decisive he’s seen and that he expects it to have an impact on voters. “There were lots of people watching who really didn't know Mitt Romney,” McKinnon argues. “They know Obama, but they just heard a lot about Mitt Romney. And they saw a completely different person last night.  Mitt Romney is revisiting his now infamous, secretly-record remarks about the 47% of Americans who don't pay income tax, telling Fox News last night that he doesn't stand behind those comments after all. CNN's Candy Crowley weighs in on this change of tune on Starting Point this morning, saying that "the shift is quite likely how they decided to deal with it in the debate." "My sense of this is that perhaps he thought the president was going to bring it up at the debate and that was the answer he had read," Crowley explains "I think that was the ready answer and perhaps they wanted it out."  With less than six weeks until the 2012 election, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will face off in the first presidential debate Wednesday. Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX) argues that the debate will be a “game changer” for Romney, offering the former governor the chance to better communicate his message to the American public. “The expectations are most Americans believe President Obama's going to win the debates,” Poe says. “That's why it's a great opportunity for Governor Romney to have an upset.
