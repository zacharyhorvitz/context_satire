 Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin insisted Monday that she "never blamed" President Barack Obama for her son's recent arrest on domestic violence charges. Stumping for Donald Trump last month, Palin alluded to her son's arrest earlier that week and suggested that Obama did not respect and honor military servicemembers returning from duty. 'The Evil Hours': Author's deep, personal take on post-traumatic stress "What my own son is going through, what he is going through coming back, I can relate to other families who feel ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with," she said at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a day after endorsing Trump.  President Barack Obama's former White House press secretary says the President has a preference in the Democratic primary to replace him: Hillary Clinton. Obama has maintained neutrality in the primary and recently met with Clinton's opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, at the White House. Still, his comments on the race have seemed to favor his former secretary of state, if only slightly. Jay Carney told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Wednesday that's no accident -- and the President does want Clinton to win.  President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama on Sunday discussed their traditions for the Super Bowl, as well as the improvement the President wants to make to the White House for his successor. In an interview with Gayle King on CBS's Super Bowl pregame show, Obama said that he hopes to have the whole "tech thing" figured out, adding that there's a lot of Wi-Fi dead spots in the White House. The first lady agreed it's a subject of contention in the house saying, "The girls are just irritated by it," referring to the Obama's daughters Sasha and Malia. Obama traditionally does an interview before professional football's biggest game of the year, but this was the first time he was joined by the first lady.
