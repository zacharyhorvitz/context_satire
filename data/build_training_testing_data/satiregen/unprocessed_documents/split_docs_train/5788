 Starbucks has planned an elaborate racial bias training session for its employees. On Tuesday afternoon, May 29, workers at each location will break into small groups to learn together. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson, Chairman Howard Schultz and musician and activist Common will serve as virtual guides. Employees will talk about their own experiences, and watch a film about bias.  Starbucks hopes that its afternoon of racial bias training will help open a discussion about race. "We realize that four hours of training is not going to solve racial inequity in America," Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Tuesday. But he said, "We need to have the conversation. We need to start."  Over the course of four hours on Tuesday, 175,000 Starbucks employees talked about racial bias. Across the country, employees participated in a mandatory training. About 8,000 company-owned stores and offices were closed to customers for the afternoon. In self-guided groups of three to five, workers settled in for an intense afternoon.
