The poultry industry also plays a large part in the United States economy, both in domestic purchasing and through international demand. The USDA reports that the U.S. is the “world’s largest producer and second largest exporter of poultry meat.”  In 2010, the U.S. produced 36.9 billion pounds of broiler meat and exported 6.8 billion pounds of broiler meat. This equates to an estimated retail value of 45 billion dollars in 2010. Antibiotics in poultry farming is the controversial prophylactic use of antibiotics in the poultry farming industry. They have been applied in mass quantities since 1951, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved their use. Three years prior to the FDA's approval, scientists were investigating a phenomenon in which chickens who were rooting through bacteria-rich manure were displaying signs of greater health than those who did not. Through testing, it was discovered that chickens who were fed a variety of vitamin B12 manufactured with the residue of a certain antibiotic grew 50 percent faster than those chickens who were fed B12 manufactured from a different source. According to a report by the World Health Organization, H5N1 may be spread indirectly. The report stated the virus may sometimes stick to surfaces or get kicked up in fertilizer dust to infect people.
