After a conversation about the arctic, Naoufel was reminded of something from their conversation over the intercom and built a wooden igloo on a nearby rooftop of a nearby building. Returning home one day, he found his cousin talking to Gabrielle, and that he has invited them both to a party. That evening, Naoufel took Gabrielle to the rooftops, where they discussed fate and Naoufel wondered if it can be changed by doing something unexpected, such as leaping from the roof onto a nearby crane. He showed her the igloo he built and revealed that they had met before when he delivered pizza. Naoufel tracked Gabrielle to the library where she worked and followed her to a nearby neighbourhood where she dropped off medicine to a carpenter, her relative Gigi. Naoufel, seeing an ad for an apprentice in the window, asked about the position. Gigi was reluctant, but accepted after learning that Naoufel was an orphan. Naoufel moved out of his uncle's house and into an attic apartment provided by Gigi. The choice of holding the Super Bowl outdoors in a cold weather environment generated some controversy. When it was released in August 2013, the "Winter Outlook" section in the 2014 Farmers' Almanac predicted that a winter storm would hit just about the time Super Bowl XLVIII kicked off; this generated the attention of several media sources, including ESPN's Rick Reilly in a piece that aired on ESPN's Monday Night Countdown on October 21, 2013. In a radio interview broadcast on WFAN, Fox studio analyst Terry Bradshaw stated that he opposes the idea of a cold Super Bowl, stating "I don't want it to be bad ... What if we get two passing teams?" In a piece published on Sports Illustrated's "Monday Morning Quarterback" site, Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman also opposed holding the game at MetLife Stadium, stating that "it's the league's responsibility to show its audience the best possible product, and this can't happen in the snow".
