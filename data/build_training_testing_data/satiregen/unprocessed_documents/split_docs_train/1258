From 2013 until 2015, Healey appeared in TV commercials shown in the United States and Canada, for Cottonelle toilet paper, in which she approached random people and asked them to use Cottonelle and "go commando" – meaning without underwear – to demonstrate how effectively Cottonelle cleaned them. Even at the Amundsen–Scott Research Station at the South Pole, complaints have been raised over which way to install toilet paper. During the six-month-long polar night, a few dozen residents are stuck living together, and while many of the headaches of modern life are far away, food and hygiene are not.

Cottonelle is a brand of toilet paper produced by Kimberly-Clark. The company has made several different toilet paper types such as regular, Cottonelle Double, (Two-ply) Cottonelle Ultra, Cottonelle Aloe & E, Cottonelle Kids, and Cottonelle Extra Strength, and are currently sold in the United States and Australia under the Kleenex brand. Cottonelle's mascot was originally a woman. At the time, the commercials usually consisted of how soft the roll was by showing a cotton ball and comparing it to the product itself.
