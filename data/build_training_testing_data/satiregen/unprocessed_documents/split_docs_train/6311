Fay returns a couple of weeks later to inform the boys that Russell has had a heart attack and is in the hospital. As they plan to visit him, the hospital calls Fay and she informs her sons that Russell has died. Aaron's partner David Tanaka (Takaya Honda) contacts the hospital for more information and reveals that Russell's last words were Memory Cove, a place the family used to visit. Fay tells her sons that she is going back to Port Lincoln, before explaining to Sheila that she had an affair in Memory Cove and fell pregnant.  Since ISIS announced it burned a captured Jordanian pilot to death, his country has mourned him as a martyr, but his family has mourned him as a son, a cousin. Moath al-Kasasbeh's mother, just out of the hospital, was too frail to speak Thursday, as she sat with other women in mourning. But his cousin Layla al-Kasasbeh shared fond memories of him between crying spells. "He always wanted to be a pilot," she said.  It was news Lois Greste hoped to hear for more than a year. "I sort of dreamed about it quietly, not daring to think about it too much," she said Monday, grinning as she described her relief at learning her son was released from prison and safely out of Egypt. Australian Al Jazeera journalist Peter Greste had been behind bars since December 2013. On Sunday, family members learned he was finally free.
