Paul repeatedly calls the set looking for Alison, but is told that she finished rewriting the script and went home. Stanley then falsely informs Paul that he is planning to scrap the production and invites Paul to meet him at the stage that night. Stanley directs the final scene of the movie, but secretly rigs a light fixture to fall into the tank and electrocute the actress inside. When Paul arrives on set just afterwards, Stanley frames him for the incident and sends him fleeing. Also in 2005, St. Louis Cardinals radio broadcaster Wayne Hagin claimed manager Don Baylor said that Helton had "tried the juice" in the 1990s, implying steroid use. Helton vehemently denied the allegation and considered legal action against Hagin. Hagin later apologized clarifying his comments saying he was "referring to supplements, creatine, not steroids" when he said "juiced". Baylor said of his conversation with Hagin "We discussed creatine and that was the end of the conversation. When Alison returns to the tank alone to continue writing, she is ambushed by an unknown person. Helton believes that Paul Parsons is responsible, in an effort to sabotage the production. Helton then discovers that Stanley has made changes to the script without his knowledge, further angering him. In turn, Stanley drugs Helton and takes him back to the cabin where he buries him alive, using fireworks to cover his panicked screams.
