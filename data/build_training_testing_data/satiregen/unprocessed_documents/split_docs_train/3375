Today Buttershaw Business and Enterprise College is a foundation school administered by the Buttershaw Learning and Achievement Trust and Bradford City Council. The school offers GCSEs and BTECs as programmes of study for pupils, while students in the sixth form have the option to study from a range of A-levels and further BTECs. In his budget speech of March 2006, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown announced that the government would be funding a network of best practice to support the delivery of Enterprise Education within the UK. This network (called the Schools' Enterprise Education Network (SEEN) was based on the expertise within BECsâ€”56 hubs (one per county) were identified in May 2006. At a launch conference the hub co-ordinators were advised of the local BECs that would act as 'spokes' to support the dissemination to all state-maintained secondary schools. As Cowes High School, the school was designated a Business and Enterprise College. As part of the reorganisation of the education system on the Isle of Wight, Cowes Pathfinder Partnership was successful in their bid against Academies Enterprise Trust take over the school. In 2011, the school opened with the age range extended to Year 7 through Year 13. It is now one of five secondary providers on the Isle of Wight.
