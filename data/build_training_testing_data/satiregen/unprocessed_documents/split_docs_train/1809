The next big contest was in Wisconsin on April 3, 2012. Acknowledging the wide delegate gap between himself and Romney, Santorum said that he would continue fighting and would secure enough delegates to deny Romney the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, which would lead to an open convention floor fight. Of a convention contest, Santorum said, "I think it would be a fascinating display of open democracy. And I think it would be an energizing thing for our party to have a candidate emerge who isn't the blessed candidate of the Republican establishment." Santorum had been considered a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election since at least the suspension of his 2012 campaign. A Los Angeles Times article about Santorum's 2012 campaign suspension mentioned that his strong second-place showing in that election would bolster any effort to get the nomination in 2016 or 2020. During an interview with Greta Van Susteren on Fox News on May 6, 2015, Santorum commented that he was the underdog in the 2012 election and that he would likely be the underdog again in the 2016 election, saying "We're very comfortable there." However, eight months in, Santorum failed to get his campaign going, with polling numbers dropping, and staying, below 1.0%.  Rick Santorum told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday that he does not believe ending automatic citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants born in the U.S. required a constitutional amendment, believing that Congress can end the controversial practice by merely passing a law. Some presidential candidates who oppose birthright citizenship believe that the 14th Amendment needs to be repealed to change that law. But Santorum disagrees, pointing to Congress' ability to determine naturalization. He said he supports ending the policy for future children born here.
