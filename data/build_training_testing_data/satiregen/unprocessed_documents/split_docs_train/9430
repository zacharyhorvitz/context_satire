On February 4, 2013, Felicia is shocked to find that Frisco has returned unannounced to Port Charles, and the two share a poignant reunion at The Floating Rib. Felicia has a difficult decision in choosing between Mac and Frisco. Frisco later proposes at the Nurses Ball, but Felicia tells him that her heart belongs to Mac and a dejected Frisco leaves shortly after. Felicia proposes to Mac the same night, and they married on August 16, 2013. During his time at the Police Academy, Cadet Jones gets involved in the brownstone murder investigation, and along with Co-Chief of Police Anna Devane help crack the Laurelton murder mystery. Not long after, on June 20, 1986, Frisco graduates from the Police Academy and marries Felicia Cummings all on the same day, his birthday. Later that summer, when his wife is framed for grand theft, Frisco and Felicia go on the run eluding several mob hit attempts as they travel from New York City to Cincinnati, to Atlantic City, and later hide out at the circus before returning to Port Charles where Frisco is intent on clearing his wife's name, is instrumental in the take-down of mob boss, Mr. Big, and is promptly promoted to Detective. Frisco arrived in Port Charles in 1984 when he is hired as the lead singer for "Blackie and the Riff Raff." He becomes friends with fellow band member Blackie Parrish and the two move in together at the Port Charles Hotel. The band breaks up when Blackie is sent to prison, and Frisco lands in the hospital after getting beaten up for quitting the music business. When Frisco's vocal chords are temporarily damaged, he is assigned a speech therapist, Tania Roskov, with whom he has a brief flirtation before losing interest upon the arrival of Felicia Cummings.
