In demonology, Phenex is a Great Marquis of Hell and has twenty legions of demons under his command. He teaches all wonderful sciences, is an excellent poet, and is very obedient to the conjuror. Phenex hopes to return to Heaven after 1,200 years, but he is deceived in this hope. He is depicted as a phoenix, which sings sweet notes with the voice of a child, but the conjurer must warn his companions (for he has not to be alone) not to hear them and ask him to put in human shape, which the demon supposedly does after a certain amount of time.  A wildfire burning in central Arizona is forcing evacuations in a remote area near Prescott National Forest in Arizona, the US Forest Service said. The Cellar Fire has burned nearly 7,000 acres in an area located about 16 miles south of Prescott, and it was 0% contained as of Thursday, fire officials said. Firefighters have been trying to contain the fire since a lightning strike ignited it on Sunday, the forest service said. A mandatory evacuation was issued Thursday for residents in Pine Flat, the Yavapai County Sheriff's office said. In Greek mythology, Phoenix (Ancient Greek: Φοῖνιξ Phoinix, gen. Φοίνικος Phoinikos) was the son of king Amyntor, and a king of the Dolopians. Phoenix, on the urgings of his mother (variously named as Cleobule, Hippodameia, or Alcimede) had sex with his father's concubine. Amyntor, discovering this, called upon the Erinyes to curse him with childlessness. In later accounts of the story, Phoenix was falsely accused by Amyntor's concubine, and blinded by his father, but Chiron restored his sight.
