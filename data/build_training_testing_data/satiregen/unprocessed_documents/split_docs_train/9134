On October 3, 2003, during a show at the Mirage, a seven year old white tiger named Mantecore (frequently misspelled Montecore or Mantacore) attacked Roy. As part of the act but veering off script, Roy held his microphone to Mantecore's mouth and told him to say "Hello" to the audience. Mantecore responded by biting Roy's sleeve. Roy swatted the Tiger and barked "release!" In a case of life imitating art, the 1993 episode "$pringfield" (the first episode featuring Gunter and Ernst) depicts the duo being savagely mauled by their trademark white tiger, Anastasia. Ten years later, the trained white tiger Montecore dragged Roy Horn off-stage by his neck during a performance at The Mirage. According to the DVD commentary on this episode on the Simpsons season five DVD set, the part where Gunter and Ernst get attacked is considered "the greatest prediction" the Simpsons ever made, but it was "bound to happen" considering how the tiger was treated. While being taken to the hospital, Horn said, "Mantecore is a great cat. Make sure no harm comes to Mantecore." Horn told People Magazine in September 2004 that Mantecore "saved his life" by attempting to drag him to safety after he suffered a stroke. Steve Wynn, owner of the Mirage, later said the tiger was reacting to a "beehive" hairdo adorning a female audience member in the front row.
