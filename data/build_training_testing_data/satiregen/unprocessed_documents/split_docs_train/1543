A secret conference between the US and the Soviets is taking place. Jaime becomes involved, but is poisoned by enemy agents intent on disrupting the conference. Jaime is dying and the agents have informed the OSI that they must gain access to the conference in return for the antidote. With Jaime close to death it is up to her OSI friends, including Chris and Max, to help. Posing as a flight attendant, Jaime is undercover to protect Rudy who is on the flight with documents concerning a secret formula. When the plane is hijacked by people trying to kidnap Rudy, it crash lands on a deserted island. Jaime and Rudy hide for a time, are caught by the hijackers, but Jaime overpowers them and the pair are soon rescued. This episode is similar to "Survival of the Fittest," the second episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, in which Oscar (Richard Anderson), instead of Rudy, was targeted. The engraving plate for the U.S. hundred dollar bill has been stolen and traced to the Mexican village of Hidalgo. Jaime goes in to retrieve it, but finds herself up against a town full of killers and thieves. She retrieves the plate, but it looks unlikely she'll get out alive. With the help of an assistant, they manage to cause a flood and escape.
