 President Donald Trump's ears must have been burning as Democrats met in Ohio at the most crowded presidential debate in US history on Tuesday. The 12 candidates at the CNN/New York Times debate conjured up visions of a vastly different America should they evict him from the White House in 2020. They'd reverse Trump's erratic, "America First" twists and turns, and restore the US leadership in the world -- somehow. But as the heated exchanges on health care, tax and billionaires showed, the Democratic Party still doesn't know how far left it wants to go.  Polls show that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination. And on Tuesday night in Ohio, her 11 rivals acted like it. The party's fourth presidential debate, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, showcased the shifting dynamics of the Democratic primary. Warren was under attack all night -- though it's far from clear whether anyone dented her status at the top of the field.  A dozen (!) Democratic presidential candidates took the stage in Ohio for the fourth debate of the 2020 election, the largest field ever to participate in a single debate. I watched, took notes, tweeted and picked some of the best -- and the worst -- of the night. My winners and losers are below.
