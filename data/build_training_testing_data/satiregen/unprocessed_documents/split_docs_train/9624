During a luau-themed sendoff party at the police station, Stottlemeyer and Linda dance with each other. Still believing Monk to be wrong about his suspicions toward Linda, he asks her about whether she has seen Monk. At once, Linda confesses plainly about Monk searching her house for evidence, but then she tells him in a nervously hushed voice that Monk made an advance at her and threatened to sleep with her. Stottlemeyer, having known Monk longer than Linda has and aware of Adrian's unwavering devotion to Trudy, instinctively realizes that she is lying. Natalie overhears a woman (in "Mr. Monk and Mrs. Monk") who looks like Trudy say that she faked her own death to protect Adrian. Adrian begins to believe this might be true, but in the end, it turns out that this woman is an actress who has attempted to pass herself off as the real Trudy in order to get the key to Trudy's old storage unit. Dr. Kroger is instrumental in trying to get Monk reinstated as a detective, all while discussing his problems and progress as a person. In the novel Mr. Monk and the Blue Flu, Natalie describes Dr. Kroger as relaxed towards everything, to such an extent that she notes that she could easily walk into his office with a monkey on her head and a hatchet in her chest, and he would not be the least bit disturbed.
