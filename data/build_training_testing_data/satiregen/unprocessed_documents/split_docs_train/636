Space mirrors are man-made satellites that are designed to change the amount of solar radiation that impacts the Earth as a form of climate engineering. Since the conception of the idea in the 1980s, space mirrors have mainly been theorized as a way to deflect sunlight to counter global warming and was seriously considered in the 2000’s. There have been several proposed implementations of the space mirror concept but none have been implemented thus far other than the Znamya project by the Russians due to logistical concerns and challenges of deployment.  It's hard to top the tricky, first-ever landing on a comet, broadcast live on the Internet. That's what space lovers and other curious types got on Wednesday, when the European Space Agency's probe Philae touched down on Comet 67P. It was high drama that continued into the afternoon as questions arose about whether the probe, in fact, stuck the landing despite the fact that harpoons designed to anchor it failed to fire. Then the probe's batteries appeared to conk out.
