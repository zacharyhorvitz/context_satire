During World War II, Garrison served in the American Navy, where his ship was torpedoed and sunk at sea. With Garrison now considered missing in action, Miss Ellie and Jock pushed to have him declared dead in absentia, which would allow Miss Ellie to inherit Southfork upon her father's death. Although she went along with it at the time, Miss Ellie later felt guilty for doing so, as she believed that Garrison, as firstborn, was the rightful heir to the land. However, with nothing to suggest that Garrison was still alive, she and Jock eventually inherited Southfork and split their time between the land and Jock's company, Ewing Oil.
