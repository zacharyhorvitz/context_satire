On 17 February 2009, it was announced that both Paramount Comedy 1 and Paramount Comedy 2 would be re-branded as Comedy Central and Comedy Central Extra on 6 April 2009 at 9Â pm. The name change coincided with the launch of a new programming line-up which included new episodes of Two and a Half Men, The Office and South Park. In 2014, it was announced that Stephen Colbert would leave Comedy Central to host The Late Show on CBS, following the retirement of David Letterman, the first host of Late Show. The final episode of The Colbert Report aired on Comedy Central on December 18, 2014, after nine years and a total of 1,447 episodes. The final episode of The Colbert Report was watched by 2.481 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode ever in the show's history. The finale was the most-watched cable program of the night in its time slot, beating The Daily Show which was seen by 2.032 million viewers. During Sheen's roast, Steve-O made the joke "The last time this many nobodies were at a roast, at least Great White was playing". This was a reference to The Station nightclub fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island that killed 100 people on February 20, 2003. It was removed from broadcast on Steve-O's request.
