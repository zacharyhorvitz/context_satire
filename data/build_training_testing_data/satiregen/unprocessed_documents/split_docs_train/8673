 They've got one in New York. Paris arguably had the first. And Tokyo's has been a huge hipster success. So it was, perhaps, inevitable that China would get a high line of its own. Grant Park is a large urban park (319 acres or 1.29 kmÂ²) in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois. Located within the city's central business district, the park's most notable features are Millennium Park, Buckingham Fountain, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Museum Campus. Originally known as Lake Park, and dating from the city's founding, it was renamed in 1901 to honor US President Ulysses S. Grant. The park's area has been expanded several times through land reclamation, and was the focus of several disputes in the late 19th century and early 20th century over open space use.
