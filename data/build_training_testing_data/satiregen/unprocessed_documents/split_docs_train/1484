In 1928, the present building was completed and into it moved 892 students and a faculty of 32, marking the beginning of the Junior and Senior High system. New additions included the Home Economics building, and the only boat-building class in the United States. In the following years, the school auditorium, the shops and the field house were added. In 1931 came a strong demand to change the school's name. Thus, from humble beginnings in 1885 to the advent of a prominent high school in 1915, Edison has expanded from a tiny thatched hut to a present extensive structure; from a faculty of one to over 100; from a student body of ten to over 2200; from a school of agriculture to one with diversified courses. The prevailing school spirit, standards of integrity, and ideals of scholarship and sportsmanship have reigned supreme throughout the years. These ideals of Miami Edison have helped to mold many outstanding personalities, but no man lives without leaving his mark in some way, and Miami Edison is rich in all these - her sons, daughters, and those who cherish her name. Currently the Democratic Republic of Congo's music is dominated by the "ndombolo" dance and well represented by the newest congolese superstar:Fally Ipupa is a strong performer from the Democratic Republic of Congo who worked with the legendary Koffi Olomide in his group, Quartier Latin, before branching out on his own. His performances are energetic, his delivery unsurpassable. Female fans love to watch as he whips his songs to new heights in time to his swiveling hips (part of the reason he made the top ten sexiest men list). The mix of rhumba,  reggae, soul and ndombolo have proven to be his magical elixir.
