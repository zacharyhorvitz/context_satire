 Two days after he unequivocally backed Indiana's controversial "religious freedom" law as not "discriminatory at all," former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Wednesday at a private Silicon Valley fundraiser that Indiana could have taken a "better...more consensus-oriented approach." "By the end of the week, Indiana will be in the right place," Bush said. Indiana lawmakers and Republican Gov.  Under pressure from critics including the most powerful employer in Arkansas, Governor Asa Hutchinson has asked for changes to the state's  controversial religious freedom law. The move comes a day after the CEO of Arkansas-based Walmart asked the governor to veto the bill, which was approved Tuesday by the Arkansas House. The law is similar to the one adopted by Indiana last week, which sparked outrage from those who say it opens the door for discrimination against gays and lesbians. "We commend Governor Hutchinson and legislative leaders for reconsidering" the bill, Walmart said in a tweet, adding that it hopes lawmakers will "make certain any legislation does not encourage discrimination."  Sen. Ted Cruz said Wednesday he's not going to "second guess" Indiana Gov. Mike Pence for working to tweak his state's controversial religious freedom law, but offered a robust defense of the initial efforts made by Indiana lawmakers. Cruz, during his first stop in Iowa since declaring his presidential campaign last week, also chided some big businesses for expressing opposition toward to the law, as well as against a similar bill in Arkansas. "I think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda," the Texas Republican told reporters.
