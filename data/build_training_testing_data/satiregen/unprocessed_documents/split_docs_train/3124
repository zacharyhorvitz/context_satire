The show begins following the death of Old Jack Padráig, presumed to not have left behind a will. His niece Rita O’Connor prepares to move her family from Dublin into her uncle’s home in Ros na Rún only to find that her cousin Jack Hayes is already occupying the property, leading to a family dispute over its inheritance. Surrounding the circumstances of Old Jack’s death is seedy local publican Tadhg Ó Direáin, whom Rita recalls being raped by on the night of her hen party seventeen years ago. Rita’s son Jason is devastated when he learns that Tadhg is his biological father, though the two later establish a relationship. In the season 3 episode "Molly's New Shoes", the Peggy character reacts to her fiance's plans to retire and move to Arizona with the line: "Arizona? Why should I go to Arizona? It's nothing but a furnace full of drunk Indians." This prompted calls by the Native American Journalists Association, among others, for an apology. Following the show’s 20th season, Bernie’s criminal brother Andy Ó Neachtain returns to the series in an attempt to extort money, kidnapping Tadhg and Francis’s daughter Ainé for ransom and nearly strangling his estranged wife Bobbi-Lee during her escape. An unconscious Andy is tossed into the river by Tadhg with a reluctant Vince De Búrca’s assistance, though is later found to have survived. A major plot spanning several seasons involves the conflict between sisters Katy and Dee Daly, which begins when Katy becomes pregnant following a one-night stand with Dee’s fiancé Mack Ó Riain. Dee takes desperate measures to hide the truth from Mack including becoming pregnant herself and undermining Katy's sanity, with the storyline intended to highlight the effects of gaslighting upon its victims.
