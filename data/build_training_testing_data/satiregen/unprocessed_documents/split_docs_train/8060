Beginning in the mid-1950s and continuing through the early 1960s, "The Cheerios Kid" was a mainstay in Cheerios commercials. The Kid, after eating Cheerios, quickly dealt with whatever problem presented in the commercial, using oat-produced "Big-G, little-o" "Go-power." The character was revived briefly in the late 1980s in similar commercials. In 2012, The Cheerios Kid and sidekick Sue were revived in an internet video that showed how Cheerios "can lower cholesterol." Many television commercials for Cheerios have targeted children featuring animated characters (such as an animated Honeybee). Bullwinkle was featured in early 1960s commercials, with the tag line at the end of the ad being "Go with Cheerios!" followed by Bullwinkle, usually worse for wear due to his Cheerios-inspired bravery somewhat backfiring, saying "...but watch where you're going!" Hoppity Hooper was also featured in ads in the mid-1960s, as General Mills was the primary sponsor of his animated program. Honey Nut Clusters is part of General Mills family of Fruit & Nut cereals, including Raisin Nut Bran and Basic 4. In 2009 the packaging on all of these cereals was updated to a different "family of cereals" look, however some consumers were disappointed and the company switched back to the legacy packaging currently on shelves. The recipe for this cereal was changed in April 2007, so that it no longer actually includes nuts, substituting natural almond flavoring in its place. The picture on the box no longer depicts the same almond clusters, but the name still includes the word nut.
