In the mid-1940s, Gehrke toyed with notion of painting a football helmet. Rams coach Bob Snyder suggested Gehrke paint a helmet with the ram horns on it that he could present to the team's owner Dan Reeves. Gehrke painted two ram horns on an old college helmet and presented the design to Reeves, who was intrigued. Reeves then contacted the NFL for a ruling on legality of having a football helmet painted. While the mask protected Gehrke's face, it also obscured his vision on pass plays to the sides. He could only see the ball with one eye. However, on punt returns his vision was unobstructed. He returned to using the traditional helmet the next season. Gehrke is also credited with developing the first helmet with a full facemask. He developed the face mask after having his nose broken three times during the 1946 season. He played the entire 1947 season with the facemask, which was made by Gehrke first applying a clay mold to his face. Once the mask dried, he had a few of the machinists who were running the power stamping machines at Northrop cover it with a sheet of aluminum.
