 The nation's leading hospital and doctor groups are lining up against the Republican health care bill, saying they fear millions of  Americans will lose coverage. The influential industry organizations, which helped the Affordable Care Act pass in 2010, are particularly worried about the bill's potential impact on lower-income and vulnerable Americans. These folks have been helped by the law's expansion of Medicaid and its subsides that are more generous for those lower on the income ladder. The GOP bill would eliminate the funding for Medicaid expansion and curtail federal support for the entire Medicaid program. On December 22, 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law by President Donald Trump. Inside the final version of the bill was a repeal of the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which required individuals and companies to get healthcare for themselves and their employees. It was this mandate which kept healthcare costs down under the PPACA by promoting cost sharing over a larger pool. Economists believe the repeal of the individual mandate will lead to higher premiums and lower enrollment in the current market though they do not agree with how much.  Health insurers are worried that the Republicans' bill to repeal Obamacare will leave many lower-income Americans unable to afford coverage. The nation's two leading insurance industry groups, America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, are asking lawmakers to provide more assistance to these consumers. The Republican bill calls for giving people refundable tax credits of between $2,000 and $4,000 that are adjusted mainly by age to help reduce their premiums. But this method is widely viewed as less generous for those lower on the income scale than Obamacare's subsidies, which are based on an enrollee's income and cost of coverage.
