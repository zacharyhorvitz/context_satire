The two would grow closer when the android then cured Rick of his cancer and bestowed him two gifts. Due to a tachyon-enhanced hourglass, Rick was now able to occasionally see one hour into the future, as well as being given an hour with his dad in the Timepoint. The Hourman android had plucked Rex out of the timestream before he was killed fighting Extant, placing him in the Timepoint- an area outside of time- for an hour; when Rick was not in the Timepoint, time stood still, but when he entered it he could interact with his father for advice or simple conversation. When the hour in the Timepoint would be up however, Rex would be sent back in time, where he would fight and die. Rick had a hard time forgiving himself, although it would later be revealed that the Wizard was in fact still alive. Rick gave up the Hourman identity almost as soon as he assumed it, as he angrily unmasked himself before a press photographer. Luckily, Lyta was able to prevent the photo from being taken and took Rick away, trying to console him. Though originally intended to be a 13-week engagement, Young agreed to extend his stay. He further confirmed in interviews that he did not go onto the planned online version of All My Children due to the insecurity it could potentially have job-wise, something he would not have with his return to The Bold and the Beautiful.
