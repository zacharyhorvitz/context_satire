The music video for "Pretty Girl Rock" was directed by Joseph Kahn. Hilson told Kahn that she did not want the video to be about her, since she felt that the song was already very much about herself. During an interview with MTV News while on the set of the video, Hilson explained that in the video she does nine outfit changes because it will show "10 different eras", starting from 1920 and up until 2010, in which she portrays herself. She also said, " way of paying homage to groundbreaking women, strong women who were fearless and so bold and so confident that they made women feel that way ... And I hope to do the same." An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Joseph Kahn and features Hilson portraying an array of American female icons of the past, including Josephine Baker, Dorothy Dandridge, The Andrews Sisters, The Supremes, Donna Summer, Janet Jackson and T-Boz of the R&B girl group TLC. The video received positive response from critics and was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2011 BET Awards, and Best Dance Performance at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards. Hilson promoted the song through live performances on various televised shows, including The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Germany's Next Topmodel, as well as in live concerts such as, the VH1 Divas Salute the Troops and the 84th Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. R&B girl group RichGirl and American rapper Lil' Kim have released their own remixes to "Pretty Girl Rock", and American rock band Parachute have covered the song. Ed Easton Jr. from radio station WNOW-FM wrote that the video was "different, creative and fun" and awarded it eight out of ten stars. Billy Johnson, Jr. from Yahoo! Music called the video "very nice" and wrote that Hilson's portrayal of Janet Jackson was her "best remake" in the video.
