 Donald Trump said Tuesday that a Cincinnati zoo "probably had no choice" but to kill a gorilla after a young boy had entered his enclosure. "It was a very tough call," the presumptive Republican nominee said at a press conference at Trump Tower in New York when he was asked about the controversy. Trump said the gorilla appeared "beautiful" and "calm," and almost mother-like with a toddler that came into his habitat. A 3-year-old boy slipped into the enclosure of a 17-year-old male gorilla named Harambe, who quickly took hold of the child.  Are Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump the same person? The normal test for that is asking if they've ever been seen in the same room together -- and, OK, they have. At Trump's third wedding. Clinton says she and Bill only went because they thought "it would be fun."  Donald Trump said in an interview Wednesday that he sees "no reason" to raise $1 billion to compete in the general election against Hillary Clinton, who is expected to raise upwards of that sum. Trump said as recently as last month in an interview with The New York Times, "I think we'll raise $1 billion," though top GOP donors and fundraisers have warned that Trump's late start to the fundraising game would likely keep him from reaching that target. Trump signaled Wednesday in an interview with Bloomberg Politics that he would instead continue to rely on free media attention to make up for his money deficit. "There's no reason to raise that," Trump said.
