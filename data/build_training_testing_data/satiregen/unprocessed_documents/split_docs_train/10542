 Ford could resume production on its F-150 trucks as soon as next week. The company told employees that they should expect to return to work at its plants in Dearborn, Michigan and outside of Kansas City, Missouri on May 18, a Ford spokesperson said on Friday. The company suspended production at the two plants — the only ones that make the truck — after a fire at a supplier's facility caused it to run out of parts. The F-150 has been the top selling US vehicle by any manufacturer for more than 40 years.  Ford is suspending production of its F-150 trucks after a fire at a supplier's facility caused it to run out of parts for the nation's best-selling vehicle. Ford will temporarily stop making the F-150 at its plant in Dearborn, Michigan, on Wednesday night. The company had already suspended truck production at a plant just outside Kansas City, Missouri. Those are the only plants that make the truck.  Ford could halt production of the F-150, its bestselling and most profitable vehicle, following a fire at a supplier's plant in Michigan last week. Ford has already shut down truck production in a Kansas City plant, and it could shut its Dearborn, Michigan, truck plant either today or Thursday, according to a letter sent by a UAW official to union members. These are the only two plants that build the F-150. The shutdowns could last for several weeks, according to a person familiar with the situation, although plans are in flux as Ford seeks an alternative supply of the missing parts.
