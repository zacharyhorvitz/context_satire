 Philadelphia isn't just the go-to place for cheesesteaks, it's also played host to political assemblies since the revolution. Democrats and Republicans alike have chosen Philly to host some of their most important and historic party conventions. Next week in Philadelphia, the Democrats are expected to nominate Hillary Clinton as the party's first female presidential candidate. But in 1856, the Republican Party hosted an equally momentous event in its history: its first national convention.  By the end of Republican and Democratic conventions it seemed like the nation's most powerful political parties were speaking about two different countries. Many parts of the conventions -- the messages, choice of speakers, the host cities -- helped outline separate visions of the nation and where the candidates, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, want to take it in the future. Here's a recap of some of the major differences -- and even a few similarities -- from the past two weeks. 'Stronger Together' vs. 'Make America Great Again' The thematic emphasis in these two conventions couldn't have been further apart.  The City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Affection has been waiting a long time to welcome the Democratic National Convention, which has not been to Philadelphia since 1948. We Philadelphians are thrilled to welcome delegates, party officials and members, the media and others for this momentous week. Philadelphia has been so central in the story of America -- site of the First and Second Continental Congresses, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Liberty Bell and so much more. And we are about to make history again, when Hillary Clinton becomes the first woman in America nominated for president by a national party.
