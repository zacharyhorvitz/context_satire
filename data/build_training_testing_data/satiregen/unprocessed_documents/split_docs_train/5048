In Education and Operations In 2005, UNT launched the first PhD program in Environmental Ethics in the world. Three years later, the university became the first large public university in Texas to sign the "American College and University President's Climate Commitment" (ACUPCC). As of September 2012, twenty-four of the 658 signatory institutions of higher learning were from Texas. Of those twenty-four, five were full undergraduate-graduate institutions (2 private, 3 public). In 1890, when advanced education was often reserved for society's elite, Chicago minister Frank Wakely Gunsaulus delivered what came to be known as the "Million Dollar Sermon." From the pulpit of his South Side church, near the site Illinois Institute of Technology now occupies, Gunsaulus said that with a million dollars he could build a school where students can learn to think in practical not theoretical terms; where they could be taught to "learn by doing". The College of Business is host to five academic departments: (i) Accounting, (ii) Finance, Insurance, Real Estate and Law, (iii) Information Technology and Decision Sciences, (iv) Marketing and Logistics, and (v) Management. It offers seven undergraduate programs, fourteen MBA and master of science programs, and six PhD programs. In Fall 2011, the college moved into a new state-of-the-art Gold LEED certified $70 million facility named the Business Leadership Building. The college is accredited in both business and accounting by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business—accreditation for the former stretches back fifty-eight years (1961) and the latter, thirty-two years (1987).
