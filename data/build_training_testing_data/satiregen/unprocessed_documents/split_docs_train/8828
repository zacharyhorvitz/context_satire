In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon ( or ) is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally, the process names of a daemon end with the letter d, for clarification that the process is in fact a daemon, and for differentiation between a daemon and a normal computer program. For example, syslogd is a daemon that implements system logging facility, and sshd is a daemon that serves incoming SSH connections. In a Unix environment, the parent process of a daemon is often, but not always, the init process. Thanks for Nothing is a 1964 studio album by American jazz singer Rosemary Clooney. As the sole album that Clooney recorded for Reprise Records, Thanks for Nothing would mark Clooney's last solo studio work until 1976's Look My Way.
