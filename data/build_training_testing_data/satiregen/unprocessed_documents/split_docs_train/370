According to Consumer Reports, in the 1970s, the rivalry continued to heat up the market. Pepsi conducted blind taste tests in stores, in what was called the "Pepsi Challenge". These tests suggested that more consumers preferred the taste of Pepsi to Coca-Cola. The sales of Pepsi started to climb, and Pepsi kicked off the "Challenge" across the nation. The Pepsi-Cola Made with Real Sugar, formerly called Pepsi Throwback, is a brand of soft drink sold by PepsiCo in the United States for its flagship Pepsi brand. The drink is named as such because they are flavored with cane sugar and beet sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, which soft drink companies used to replace sugar (in their North American products) in the 1980s. In addition, these drinks use retro packaging. In June 2014, the Pepsi Throwback name was replaced by the current name, which continues to be made without high fructose corn syrup. In 2011, Dr Pepper Snapple Group announced 7UP Retro, a sugar-sweetened version of 7UP, that would be available for a limited-time only. This became a direct competitor to Mountain Dew Throwback, but 7UP Retro stopped production later in the year, while Mountain Dew Throwback continued production. Mexican 7UP, which is exported to the United States, still has sugar.
