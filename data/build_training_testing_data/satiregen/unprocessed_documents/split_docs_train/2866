 Two of the leading Republican candidates for the party's nomination to be president seem unaware that the republic they seek to lead is, at its very core, a nation founded on the principle of religious tolerance. On Sunday, Dr. Ben Carson said on "Meet the Press" that he would not support a Muslim as U.S. president, saying, "I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that." He also opined that Islam is not compatible with the Constitution. The CLB directors concurred, and on January 19, 1920, they formed an organization under a new name, the American Civil Liberties Union. Although a handful of other organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons, or a single theme. Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts to overturn the disfranchisement of African Americans in the South that had taken place since the turn of the century. A major source of criticism are legal cases in which the ACLU represents an individual or organization that promotes offensive or unpopular viewpoints, such as the Ku Klux Klan, Neo-Nazis, Nation of Islam, North American Man/Boy Love Association, Westboro Baptist Church or Unite the Right rally. The ACLU responded to these criticisms by stating "It is easy to defend freedom of speech when the message is something many people find at least reasonable. But the defense of freedom of speech is most critical when the message is one most people find repulsive."
