In November 2007, a New York Times article stated that MSNBC's primetime lineup was tilting more to the left. Since then, commentators have argued that MSNBC has a bias towards left-leaning politics and the Democratic Party. Fox News media analyst Howard Kurtz, while previously in the same role at The Washington Post, stated that the channel's evening lineup "has clearly gravitated to the left in recent years and often seems to regard itself as the antithesis of Fox News" In 2011, Politico referred to MSNBC as "left-leaning", and Steve Kornacki of Salon.com noted that, "MSNBCâ€™s prime-time lineup is now awash in progressive politics." Regarding changes in the channel's evening programming, senior vice president of NBC News Phil Griffin claimed that "it happened naturally.  Sen. Amy Klobuchar will take to the national stage on Monday headlining a CNN town hall in New Hampshire to make her most public case yet for why she should be the next President of the United States. Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years. Klobuchar, a three-term senator from Minnesota, is pitching herself as a pragmatic lawmaker who is willing to work with those who oppose her to get things done. "I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured," Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. MSNBC Live is the name of several hours of straight news programming on the network (both weekdays and weekends), similar to what is known as "dayside" programming on other cable news channels. Beginning in 2009, MSNBC began to fill in these hours with more "opinionated" news programming. During the network's pivot back to hard news in 2015, the name returned during daytime hours. The brand is also used during holidays and as fill-in programming when a show ends or is canceled until a new show is ready.
