In a profile of Epstein in New York magazine in 2002, former Democratic Senate leader George J. Mitchell said of Epstein, "I would certainly call him a friend and a supporter". In the same article, Donald Trump remarked, "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with.  A day after his labor secretary convened a news conference defending himself against accusations of prosecutorial malfeasance, President Donald Trump is questioning whether Alex Acosta's efforts were sufficient in quieting the uproar, people familiar with the matter said. Trump has remained publicly silent in the 24 hours since Acosta held the question-and-answer session -- at the President's urging -- to defend his role in financier Jeffrey Epstein's plea agreement over sexual assault allegations, which critics have bemoaned as woefully lenient. Epstein was ultimately sentenced to time behind bars -- but served only 13 months and was allowed to leave for long stretches to work from his office. He avoided a federal trial but did have to register as a sex offender.  America may soon have yet another acting Cabinet official, as Labor Secretary Alex Acosta hangs by a thread over his links to a 2008 plea agreement for Jeffrey Epstein. Acosta, who as a US attorney in Miami signed off on what critics now say was a lenient non-prosecution agreement with the hedge fund manager, has become a liability for his boss in an episode that is casting a questionable light on some of President Donald Trump's own decision making. More than a decade on from Acosta's involvement in the case, Epstein's arrest in New York and indictment on charges of sex trafficking and child sexual abuse in Florida and his Manhattan home between 2002 and 2005 have reignited claims that Acosta breached public trust and is unfit for federal office. Epstein has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
