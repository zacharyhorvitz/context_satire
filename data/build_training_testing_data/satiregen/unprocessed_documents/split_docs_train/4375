In 1946, Herr started a small potato chip company, with sales of approximately thirty dollars a week. Today, as of 2012, Herr's Snacks now has more than 1,000 employees, with annual sales of approximately $100Â million. The company has become one of the major employers in Chester County and southern Lancaster County. Herr voluntarily stepped down as chairman of Herr's Snacks on January 7, 2005, in favor of his son, J.M. In 1958, the company introduced flavored potato chips, and in 1974, switched to foil packaging from the traditional glassine bags. The 1970s and 1980s saw a growth in the snack food industry which prompted an expansion in the variety of products being manufactured, including corn chips, tortilla chips, and pretzels. The 1980s also saw the addition of the Herr Angus Farm, a cattle farm which made use of potato waste products.
