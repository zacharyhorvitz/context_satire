 Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper announced his Senate candidacy on Thursday, giving Democrats a widely known contender to take on a vulnerable GOP incumbent a week after Hickenlooper dropped out of the presidential race. "I've always said Washington was a lousy place for a guy like me who knows how to get things done -- but this is no time to walk away from the table," Hickenlooper says in his campaign announcement video. "We ought to be working together to move this country forward and stop the political nonsense.  Rep. Seth Moulton ended his presidential bid on Friday during a speech at the Democratic National Committee summer meeting in San Francisco, closing out a campaign in which he failed to get traction or make this year's Democratic debates. "Today, I want to use this opportunity, with all of you here, to announce that I am ending my campaign for president," Moulton said at the DNC meeting. "Though this campaign is not ending the way we hoped, I am leaving this race knowing that we raised issues that are vitally important to the American people and our future." Moulton, a Marine veteran and three-term congressman who represents Boston's northern suburbs, told the audience that he plans to run for reelection to Congress and relaunch Serve America, a PAC that looks to elect Democrats with service backgrounds.  Democratic Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Wednesday announced he is suspending his presidential campaign. "It's become clear I'm not going to be carrying the ball -- I'm not going to be president, so I'm withdrawing tonight from the race," Inslee told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. "But I have to tell you, look, I've been fighting climate change for 25 years, and I've never been so confident of the ability of America now to reach critical mass to move the ball."
