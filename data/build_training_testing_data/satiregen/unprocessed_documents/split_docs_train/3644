 Utah Sen. Mike Lee endorsed Ted Cruz for president Thursday, making him the first senator to back the Texas lawmaker, and delivering another blow to Marco Rubio. Lee praised Cruz for the promises he has made to protect gun rights, fight Obamacare and uphold other conservative principles, in an announcement just hours before CNN's Republican debate. "Ted has kept those promises and every other promise he has made to the people of Texas," Lee said. "It is with that trust that he's earned that he's going to move forward and unite our party."  The Republican Party is waking up -- but it might already be too late. Donald Trump's stroll toward the GOP presidential nomination is starting to turn the denial evident for months among key party power brokers to desperation. The mood of some in the party was aptly summed up Thursday by Republican lobbyist and former congressman Vin Weber on CNN's "The Lead" with Jake Tapper. Nightcap: GOP plans for open convention; anti-Trump conservatives huddle | Sign up "All of a sudden, everybody is saying 'Oh My God â€” the house is burning down we should have done something before it got this far,'" said Weber, who is supporting John Kasich in the presidential race and is calling on the party to unite behind the Ohio Governor.  Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins is not interested in divisive presidential candidates, even if it's the frontrunner of his own party. Robbins -- who refers to himself as a centrist Republican -- told CNN's Poppy Harlow Thursday that at this point he's leaning toward Republican John Kasich or Democrat Hillary Clinton. In fact, he called Clinton a "great candidate." But he didn't go as far as to formally endorsing either presidential hopeful.
