Filmmaker Adam Green begins a documentary about artwork that features monsters. Green is surprised when William Dekker, a retired detective, contacts him and claims to have proof of the existence of monsters. Green's wife reacts skeptically, but he reworks his documentary to focus on Dekker and his efforts to expose the monsters' underground home, which he calls "The Marrow". Green interviews Dekker at his house, who claims that he has seen many monsters and identified some of them through sketches. The serpent approached Eve rather than Adam because Adam had heard the word of God with his own ears, whereas Eve had only his report; Eve tasted the fruit and knew at once that she was doomed to death, and said to herself that it was better she trick Adam into eating so that he too would die, and not take another woman in her place. Adam ate the fruit unaware of what he was doing, and was filled with grief. When Adam blamed Eve after eating the forbidden fruit, God rebuked him that Adam as a man should not have obeyed his wife, for he is the head, not her. Production began in 2010 and slowly progressed over the next four years whenever Green had free time between projects. Green suffered two major setbacks during filming: the death of his friend Dave Brockie, and his divorce from Rileah Vanderbilt. Both events caused him to question the project, and he was tempted to remove their scenes. In both cases, he was convinced not to.
