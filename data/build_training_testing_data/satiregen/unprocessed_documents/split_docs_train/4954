 Republican Virginia lawmakers on Tuesday abruptly adjourned a special session aimed at gun control measures that was called following a mass shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building early last month. The decision to adjourn the session until mid-November -- after the state's legislative elections are held -- enraged Democrats, but Republicans said Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's calling of the session in the first place was politically motivated. "It is shameful and disappointing that Republicans in the General Assembly refuse to do their jobs, and take immediate action to save lives," Northam said in a statement Tuesday. A majority of firearm-related homicides in the United States involve the use of handguns. According to a 2013 analysis by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, 14 out of 93 mass shootings involved high-capacity magazines or assault weapons. Nevertheless, AR-15 style rifles have played a prominent role in many high-profile mass shootings in the United States and have come to be widely characterized as the weapon of choice for perpetrators of these crimes. AR-15s or similar rifles were the primary weapons used in around half of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern American history, including the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the 2015 San Bernardino attack, the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, the 2017 Sutherland Springs church shooting, and the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. In the 2010s, AR-15 style rifles have become one of the "most beloved and most vilified rifles" in the United States, according to the New York Times. The rifle has been promoted as "America's rifle" by the National Rifle Association. Steadily increasing popularity in part is due to "the amount of attention through politics and media that is devoted to banning or restricting AR pattern rifles". They have been used in mass shootings in the United States.
