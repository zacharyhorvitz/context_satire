After leaving Blue Peter and Dangerfield, Vincent presented Short Change and Fully Booked. He starred on the first series of the reality television series, I'm Famous and Frightened! in addition to the Sky One series There's Something About Miriam. In 2005, he presented a Conservative Party party political broadcast. Director Tim Burton directed a short stop-motion film as a tribute to Vincent Price called Vincent, about a young boy named Vincent Malloy who is obsessed with the grim and macabre. It is narrated by Price. "Vincent Twice, Vincent Twice" was a parody on Sesame Street. He was parodied in an episode of The Simpsons ("Sunday, Cruddy Sunday"). ...One raise of his eyebrow and you knew you were about to be thrilled by a debonair, evil, yet sympathetic villain...I can't imagine these films without Vincent Price in them. He was just a fine actor, never pretentious. The audiences that went to see him were all-inclusive, from the poorest people to the richest. Nobody disliked him.
