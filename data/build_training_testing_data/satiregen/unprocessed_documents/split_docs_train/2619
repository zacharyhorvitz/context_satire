 Although projections from the NationalHurricaneCenter now show Tropical Storm Isaac moving further west before making landfall in the Gulf of Mexico next week, Florida officials still are not taking any chances. In preparation for the storm, state and local officials are advising residents to stay alert and prepared, and readying the city of Tampa for the Republican National Convention, which is set to kick off on Monday. Bryan Koon, Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management says “we’ve been in the planning process for the republican national convention for the last year-and-a-half. We’ve had a number of meetings to coordinate this process to gather law enforcement agencies from around the state to help out with that effort in Tampa.

Isaac, which should strengthen into a hurricane in the next day or two, is expected now to strike further west, anywhere between Florida and Louisiana. The entire area from east of Morgan City, Louisiana, to Destin on the Florida Panhandle was under a hurricane warning. It appeared the storm would mostly bypass Florida's west coast and the Republican National Convention in Tampa, where the schedule was pushed back a day by organizers.

But now the city and Republicans are sharing the national spotlight with Tropical Storm Isaac, which is expected to make landfall along the Gulf Coast late Tuesday or Wednesday as a Category 1 hurricane.
