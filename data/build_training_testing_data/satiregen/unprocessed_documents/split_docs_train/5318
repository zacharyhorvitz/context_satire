 Syracuse University has suspended a professional fraternity after video footage surfaced showing members exhibiting "extremely racist" behavior, according to the university's chancellor. Videos purport to show members of Theta Tau, an engineering fraternity, repeatedly using racial slurs and simulating sex acts. Chancellor Kent Syverud called the behavior "offensive" in a statement to the campus community Wednesday. "They include words and behaviors that are extremely racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, sexist, and hostile to people with disabilities," Syverud said.  Syracuse University has permanently expelled the Theta Tau fraternity after footage emerged earlier this week of its members participating in a racist and anti-Semitic skit, Chancellor Kent Syverud said in a video statement Saturday. Theta Tau leadership was informed of the university's decision earlier Saturday, Syverud said, noting the school had suspended the fraternity soon after being made aware of the footage, which he called "racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, ableist and sexist." Students on the Syracuse campus this week were outraged after The Daily Orange, an independent student newspaper, obtained and posted a video in which a fraternity member makes another one swear to hold onto hatred for African-Americans, Hispanics and Jews, using racial slurs for those groups. Later, another student, using a derogatory word for Jews, makes a veiled reference to gas chambers in Nazi Germany. Poseidon (; Greek: Ποσειδῶν, pronounced ) was one of the Twelve Olympians in ancient Greek religion and myth, god of the sea, storms, earthquakes andhorses. In pre-Olympian Bronze Age Greece, he was venerated as a chief deity at Pylos and Thebes. His Roman equivalent is Neptune. Poseidon was protector of seafarers, and of many Hellenic cities and colonies.
