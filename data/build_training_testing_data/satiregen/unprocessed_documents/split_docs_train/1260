Piers once revealed to Janet that he faked his A-Level results to get into medical school,a and is more concerned with his television career than anything else, quoting that he "will jump onto any bandwagon to prolong it". It is later revealed that his attitude towards his patients and colleagues stems from being bullied at school, being locked in a cellar by his domineering father, and his unfeeling mother favouring his brother, a talented boy scout. In the fifth series, it was revealed that Piers wanted to be a violinist, but his father did not consent to it. His father strictly banned all music from the house for three years, and forced him to take up a career in medicine, even calling him "Doctor Crispin" as a child. Stanley (Tim Wylton) and Ella Dawkins (Lill Roughley) are Janet's meddlesome parents. Their relationship is tempestuous, getting off on a bad start from literally day one, as they argued on their honeymoon and spent the night apart. Mrs Dawkins is a typical mother-in-law, and has always thought Janet should have married Piers. She dislikes George, believing him to be an idiot and a loser. Janet and George marry at the end of the second series, which also sees the birth of their first child, Apollo "Ollie" Sunday. Janet and George also have a daughter, Cassandra "Cassie" Sunday, who is born at the start of series five. Her mother, Ella, disapproves of her marriage to George, and often asks her to get rid of him and marry Piers instead. Janet is friends with health centre receptionist Mrs. Raven, while her boss, Piers Crispin, displays an obvious crush on her.
