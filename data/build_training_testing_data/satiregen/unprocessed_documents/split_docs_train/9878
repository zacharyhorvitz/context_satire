 There are some years that shift the cultural landscape more than others and 1969 was a one of them. Quentin Tarantino's new film "Once Upon A Time in...Hollywood," which is set in 1969, explores what was happening in the creative scene 50 years ago. In the movie, Margot Robbie portrays the late actress Sharon Tate, who was murdered, along with her unborn child and six others, by Charles Manson's followers. The tragedy set off an ongoing fascination with Hollywood true crime, but several other events happened in 1969 that still reverberate to this day. On October 26, 2017, it was announced that Tom Hanks would star in the post-apocalyptic film, BIOS, about a robot who is built by Hanks' ailing character to protect the life of his beloved dog when he dies. Miguel Sapochnik would direct the film, which would be produced by Robert Zemeckis and Kevin Misher, from a script by Craig Luck and Ivor Powell. Several major studios were bidding for the rights of the film with the production expected to begin in early 2018. A few days later, it was reported that Amblin Entertainment had purchased the project, with Universal Studios set to distribute it.  Just in time for a Monday, Sony has released the first trailer for the upcoming film about the late Fred Rogers, "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. In the teaser, schoolchildren sing to Rogers on the subway and we see Tom Hanks dressed as the children's television host on the set of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood." The film is loosely based on a 1998 Esquire article by Tom Junod, about the effect Rogers' optimistic kindness had on millions of people -- and the initially skeptical journalist himself.
