Boy Meets World is an American television sitcom that chronicles the coming of age events and everyday life-lessons of Cory Matthews (Ben Savage). The show aired from 1993 to 2000 on ABC, part of the network's TGIF lineup for seven seasons. Several of the characters that originated on Boy Meets World later appeared in its sequel, Girl Meets World. The only main characters not to make an appearance on Girl Meets World are Rachel McGuire and Eli Williams. The storyline of Cory, Topanga, Shawn, and Eric moving to New York, established in the series finale, continues on in the sequel series Girl Meets World where Cory and Topanga are shown to be raising their two children, Riley (Rowan Blanchard) and Auggie (August Maturo). Riley is the series' protagonist, with Cory as a co-lead, and Topanga in a reduced role.

Shawn and Cory have challenges in their relationship throughout the season, including on the day of Cory's wedding. Shawn admits that he is no longer Cory's best friend and gives him away to Topanga. Despite this, their friendship remains intact, but Topanga sometimes feels left out. Cory and Topanga get married and move into a shabby apartment for married couples on campus.
