EastEnders is a British soap opera created by Julia Smith and Tony Holland which has been broadcast on BBC One since 1985. Set in Albert Square in the East End of London in the fictional Borough of Walford, the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as they go about their daily lives. Initially there were two 30-minute episodes per week, later increasing to three, but since 2001, episodes have been broadcast on every weekday except Wednesday (outside of special occasions). Following a raid on a biological weapons research facility, the FIB begins investigating Haines, so he needs help covering his tracks, which culminates with him trying to arrest Michael to silence him. Haines's protege, Andreas Sanchez, betrays him by informing the FIB of his superior's activities; this results in him killing Andreas. Towards the end of the game, Haines is convinced by Norton to spare Michael and only silence Trevor, whose actions brought more heat onto them. He orders Franklin to kill Trevor while Weston orders Franklin to kill Michael. The launch was delayed until February 1985 due to a delay in the chat show Wogan, that was to be a part of the major revamp in BBC1's schedules. Smith was uneasy about the late start as EastEnders no longer had the winter months to build up a loyal following before the summer ratings lull. The press were invited to Elstree to meet the cast and see the lot, and stories immediately started circulating about the show, about a rivalry with ITV (who were launching their own market-based soap, Albion Market) and about the private lives of the cast. Anticipation and rumour grew in equal measure until the first transmission at 7Â p.m. on 19 February 1985.
