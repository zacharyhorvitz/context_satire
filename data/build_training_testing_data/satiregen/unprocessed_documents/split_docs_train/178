The University of Michigan consists of a flagship campus in Ann Arbor, with two regional campuses in Dearborn and Flint. The Board of Regents, which governs the university and was established by the Organic Act of March 18, 1837, consists of eight members elected at large in biennial state elections for overlapping eight-year terms. Between the establishment of the University of Michigan in 1837 and 1850, the Board of Regents ran the university directly; although they were, by law, supposed to appoint a Chancellor to administer the university, they never did. Instead, a rotating roster of professors carried out the day-to-day administration duties. The thought of establishing a part of the University of Michigan in the city of Flint started in the year 1837 when Sarah Miles wrote a letter to her family stating, "A branch of the Michigan University at Ann Arbor is to be established in Flint at some future day." In May 1944 the Flint Board of Education requested that the University of Michigan open a satellite campus in Flint. In June 1944, Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the G.I. Bill into law. The University of Michiganâ€“Ann Arbor (UM) is the flagship campus of the University of Michigan. The oldest post-secondary institution in the state, it was founded in 1817, twenty years before the Michigan Territory achieved statehood. East Lansing-based Michigan State University is the state's largest public institution in terms of enrollment, as it had 50,340 students as of fall, 2016. With an enrollment of 21,210 students, Baker College of Flint is Michigan's largest private post-secondary institution, while Oak Park-based Yeshiva Gedolah of Greater Detroit is the state's smallest.
