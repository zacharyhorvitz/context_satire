Like many merchants, McDonald's offered sweepstakes to draw customers into its restaurants. Laws generally forbid a company from administering its own contests, in order to prevent fraud and to ensure that all prizes are given away. McDonald's had a relationship with Simon Worldwide Inc., which was responsible for the distribution of the contest pieces and the awarding of major prizes.  The labor market is going strong, and job candidates have plenty of opportunities to choose from. So much so that some are bailing on their new employers before they even start. "People are getting multiple offers in a market like today, and they are not showing up on their first day of work," said Paul McDonald, senior executive director at staffing firm Robert Half. He pointed to the strong job market and low unemployment rate as the reason for this surge in ghosting by new hires. In response to public pressure, McDonald's has sought to include more healthy choices in its menu and has introduced a new slogan to its recruitment posters: "Not bad for a McJob". The word McJob, first attested in the mid-1980s and later popularized by Canadian novelist Douglas Coupland in his book Generation X, has become a buzz word for low-paid, unskilled work with few prospects or benefits and little security. McDonald's disputes this definition of McJob. In 2007, the company launched an advertising campaign with the slogan "Would you like a career with that?"
