On January 4, 2012, Cain announced the "Cain's Solutions Revolution." His stated goal was to obtain commitments from members of Congress to support the 9–9–9 Plan before the 2012 elections. He had started a new movement, saying that the "biggest comment I got when I ended my candidacy was to keep 9–9–9 alive. That's what this is about, and I'm going to keep it alive with what I'm calling Cain's Solutions Revolution. In 2008, Cain initially praised Democratic candidate Barack Obama, saying of Obama that "His gift is the gift of oratory. That's not just the ability to speak, but the ability to connect with people." He also said that he would consider supporting Obama "under the right circumstances" but only if he made a serious attempt to "reach across the aisle". Cain instead endorsed Mitt Romney in the Republican primary, and eventually supported the GOP nominee, John McCain. On January 4, 2012, Cain announced the "Cain's Solutions Revolution".
