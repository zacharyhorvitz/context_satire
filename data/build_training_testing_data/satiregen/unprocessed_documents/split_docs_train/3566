On March 29, 2019, three sources close to McMahon told Politico that she would depart from the SBA to Chair America First Action, a pro-Trump Super PAC. This was confirmed later that afternoon in a joint press conference at Trump's Mar-a-Lago, where it was officially announced by the Trump administration that McMahon would be stepping down as the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. The resignation took effect on April 12, 2019. McMahon made an appearance as a guest speaker at the WrestleMania XXVII Press Conference. Several months later, she appeared in a backstage segment at SummerSlam to wish CM Punk luck in his match. Upon offering to shake his hand, Punk declined and insulted her: "I would, but... I know where that hand's been." Adding to this confusion, Vince Russo states in his book Forgiven that it was he who proposed the match's ending to McMahon: "'Vince - we're making this way too difficult,' I said. 'Why don't we just do this? During the course of the match, let's have a spot where Shawn puts Bret in his own hold - the Sharpshooter. As soon as Shawn clamps it on, have the referee call for the bell as if Bret quit...'".
