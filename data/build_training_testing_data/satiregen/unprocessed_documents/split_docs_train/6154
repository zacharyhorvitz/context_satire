Aspects of Dubai's old culture, while occasionally overshadowed by the boom in economic development, can be found by visiting places around the creek, which splits Dubai into two halves, Bur Dubai and Deira. The buildings lining the Bur Dubai side of the Creek provide the main flavor of the old city. Heritage Village is one of the few remaining parts of historical Dubai, containing preserved buildings. The adjoining Diving Village offers exhibits on pearl diving and fishing. The Dubai Motor Festival is a festival launched by the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing of Dubai in 2013. According to sources around 500 cars were paraded at the festival in a bid to promote tourism in the region. In November 2013, the Dubai Health Authority announced a new law that aimed to make sure that every person in Dubai had their own health insurance. Beyond ensuring that both locals and expats in Dubai would have access to affordable and quality medical care when needed, the law would also attract foreign investment to Dubaiâ€™s healthcare sector and reduce much of the burden that healthcare costs put on the public at large.
