 Hours after rival networks reported extensively on the ouster of its biggest star, Fox News finally addressed the departure of Bill O'Reilly on-air Wednesday evening. The news was discussed by Howard Kurtz, Fox's media analyst, during a segment on the network's 6 p.m. program "Special Report." The repercussions of O'Reilly's departure had been discussed during the previous hour, during which the hosts of "The Five" talked about the programming changes made in the wake of O'Reilly's departure -- all without mentioning O'Reilly's name. ("The Five" is shifting to 9 p.m., while one of its co-hosts, Eric Bolling, will host his own program at 5 p.m.)  By that time, the news had already generated considerable coverage on Fox's primary cable news competitors, CNN and MSNBC.  CNN's Alisyn Camerota, who worked for Fox News Channel for 16 years, says a "chilling effect" there stopped people from reporting harassment. "It was Roger Ailes' fiefdom. He was the king," Camerota said Thursday on "New Day." Ailes, the network's former CEO, resigned last summer after a series of sexual harassment allegations were leveled against him.  Bill O'Reilly is reportedly walking away with tens of millions of dollars. How insulting. After being accused of habitual sexual harassment and other lewd acts, causing him and his employer, Fox News, to pay out $13 million in settlements; after costing the network millions when advertisers fled his show; after finally being fired from his job after years â€” he leaves with a golden payout. Don't think for one second his firing is a win for women in the workplace.
