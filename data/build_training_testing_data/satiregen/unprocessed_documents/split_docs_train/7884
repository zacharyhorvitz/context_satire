 New Yorkers may assume that the Empire State Building lit up in orange on Wednesday night is an early Halloween treat. But New York City is the latest city vying for the attention of tech giant Amazon. The deadline to submit a proposal for Amazon's second headquarters is rapidly approaching, and cities are making last-minute efforts to stand out. Amazon has sent cities into a frenzy since announcing plans to open another headquarters in North America.  Amazon has confirmed the obvious: It's received a lot of interest from cities vying to host its second headquarters. The tech giant said on Monday that 238 cities and regions put in a bid for the opportunity. The proposals span across 54 states, provinces, districts and territories across North America. Amazon announced plans for a second headquarters in September, sending cities into a frenzy.  Atlanta is the favorite to land the new Amazon headquarters, according to an Irish gambling site. Paddy Power, which mostly takes wagers on sports but ventures into politics and other topics, gives Atlanta 2-to-1 odds against winning the competition. That's way better than Philadelphia at 7-to-1, Boston at 8-to-1 and Toronto at 9-to-1. Amazon, which already has headquarters in Seattle, is considering bids from more than 200 cities and regions to be its second home.
