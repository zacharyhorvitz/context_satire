 In front of rapt crowds, Pope Benedict XVI spoke of moments of struggle as well as joy Wednesday during his final public address from a stage set up in St. Peter's Square. In an unusually personal message, he said there had been "many days of sunshine" but also "times when the water was rough ... and the Lord seemed to sleep." Interactive: Where does the pope live? But even as the church passes through stormy seas, God will "not let her sink," he added, in what was his final general audience before he steps down Thursday evening.  On the final day of his papacy, Pope Benedict XVI met with cardinals at the Vatican on Thursday, saying "I will continue to serve you  in prayer." After the pontiff completed his remarks, the cardinals greeted him individually, shaking hands and sharing a few words with the retiring head of the Catholic Church. Benedict announced on February 11 that he would step down, becoming the first living pope to quit his job in 598 years.  Pope Benedict XVI delivered his final public prayer ceremony Sunday to a crowd of thousands at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City, amid rumors of a sex scandal brewing as he prepares to step down. "Thank you for your affection," the pope told the crowd as he appeared at the window of his apartment overlooking the square. As is customary, he opened the weekly Angelus prayer with a short sermon. Benedict spoke on the Transfiguration of Christ, one of the key moments in Jesus' life on Earth, when, according to the church, he took three disciples to pray on a mountain.
