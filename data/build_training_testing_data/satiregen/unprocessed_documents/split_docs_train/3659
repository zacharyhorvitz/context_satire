When machine learning techniques are initially used in new applications or industries, there is often not enough training data available to apply traditional processes. Some industries have the benefit of decades' worth of training data readily available; those that do not are at a significant disadvantage. In such cases, obtaining training data may be impractical, expensive, or impossible without waiting years for its accumulation. Episode notes: The contestants in this special episode were children. Instead of the usual 20 minutes, they were given 30 minutes in the appetizer round. Due to the small height of the contestants, Ted had to help them reach for something at various times.

In the city of Cohoes, New York near Albany, a man, inspired by the series, tried to forge a piece of metal over a fire in a barrel near his home.
