 Should William Potts, an American fugitive living in Cuba, ever set foot in the United States again, he faces an indictment for airplane hijacking and a potentially lengthy prison term. So why is Potts now battling to return to the same country that wants to imprison him? In 1984, Potts hijacked a Piedmont Airlines passenger plane bound for Miami with 56 people aboard. A Black Panther and self-styled revolutionary, Potts dreamed of receiving military training in Cuba that he could use to overthrow the United States government.  An American lawyer based in Moscow who used to work at the U.S. Embassy there was expelled from Russia  two weeks ago, his law firm said on Monday. Thomas Firestone was refused admission to Russia on May 5, according to the law firm Baker & McKenzie. "We have no reason to believe that our colleague has engaged in wrongdoing of any kind," the firm said in a statement. "Neither our colleague nor we have been informed of the reason for this action." The meaning of the word American in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. American is derived from America, a term originally denoting all of the New World (also called the Americas). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the United States of America. In modern English, American generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification.
