According to the Joint Congressional Committee on Presidential Inaugurations, George Washington added the words "So help me God" during his first inaugural, though this has been disputed. There are no contemporaneous sources for this fact, and no eyewitness sources to Washington's first inaugural mention the phrase at allâ€”including those that transcribed what he said for his oath. Lipinski was the only Illinois Democrat in Congress to oppose the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which passed the House on March 21, 2010. He said that he broke ranks with his party for a number of reasons, including the bill's provisions related to abortion. Lipinski had previously voted for a version of the bill that contained more stringent restrictions on abortion funding. In 2017 he said he was trying to prevent Republicans from repealing Obamacare. The International Science and Technology Cooperation Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 8, 2014 by Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D, IL-3). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. On July 14, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 406 to pass the bill 346-41.
