Many of these workers were unable to escape because the doors on their floors had been locked to prevent them from stealing or taking unauthorized breaks. More than 100,000 people participated in the funeral march for the victims. The second debates of the primary took place on July 30 and July 31 in Detroit, with O'Rourke participating on the first night. O'Rourke stated that he was running for president because of his belief that America "discovers its greatness at its moments of greatest need" and later referred to Texas as "a new battleground state" that Democrats could put in play by going to each of its 254 counties.
