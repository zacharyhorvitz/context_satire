John Chapman and his brother Nathaniel are characters in Alice Hoffman's novel The Red Garden. They appear in the chapter "Eight Nights of Love"â€”passing through the small town of Blackwell, where they plant an orchard but also the Tree of Life in the center of said town, a tree said to bloom and bear fruit in midwinter. In Hoffman's book, John has a brief relationship with a young woman called Minette Jacob, who was about to hang herself after having lost her husband, child, mother, and sister, but who regains the joy of life after meeting the brothers. In the beginning of the chapter the author hints that John was reading Swedenborg's pamphlets, and later in the novel, the characters actually refer to him as Johnny Appleseed. Arlington Heights is a municipality in Cook County in the U.S. state of Illinois. A suburb of Chicago, it lies about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of the city's downtown. The population was 75,101 at the 2010 census. It is the most populous community in the United States that is incorporated as a "village", and is the 13th most populous municipality in Illinois, although it is not far ahead of its nearby Illinois neighboring villages of Schaumburg  and adjacent Palatine. Many books and films have been based on the life of Johnny Appleseed. One notable account is from the first chapter of The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World  by Michael Pollan. Pollan states that since Johnny Appleseed was against grafting, his apples were not of an edible variety and could be used only for cider: "Really, what Johnny Appleseed was doing and the reason he was welcome in every cabin in Ohio and Indiana was he was bringing the gift of alcohol to the frontier. He was our American Dionysus."
