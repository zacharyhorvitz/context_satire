 It's a week away from Super Tuesday -- but tonight is a big evening for politics, too. The menu for politics lovers starts with a Democratic town hall featuring Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders on CNN at 8 p.m. ET. Then come the results from the Nevada Republican caucuses, where Donald Trump, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will battle it out for first place in the last GOP election before 12 states vote next Tuesday.  The battle between Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz is poised to intensify as the senators scramble to convince voters that they are the best alternative to Donald Trump, who easily won three of the four early-state Republican nominating contests and is racing toward the crucial Super Tuesday showdown next week on a tide of momentum. Rubio and Cruz are vying to lead the conservative movement into a new era. But they keep bumping into each other, finishing Tuesday's Nevada caucuses bunched together in second and third place. Now they are in danger of canceling one another out once again, on a much bigger battleground.  Marco Rubio has one of Nevada's best political teams on his side. He has a personal history in the state where he spent six years of his childhood. And he's picking up endorsements and donors after rival Jeb Bush dropped out of the race. But heading into Tuesday's Nevada Republican caucuses, Rubio's best case scenario is a second place finish to Donald Trump.
