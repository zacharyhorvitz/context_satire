Using the GPS in Cale's car, Sean is able to find the cabin where Katie is being held captive and heads off to save her after surviving Cale's attempt to kill him with a bomb. A team of FBI agents also travel to the cabin after deducing that Cale is responsible for a series of disappearances and that the property is in the name of Cale's family, but are unable to enter the private property without a warrant. Sean finds Katie, only to be knocked out by Cale, who reveals that he intends to kill Katie and frame Sean for her murder, along with the deaths of his previous victims. Katie, however, survives Cale's attempt at killing her and frees Sean, with Cale in pursuit. The initial police portrayals of the incident, consisting of about 400 pages of typed and handwritten reports, prompted police supervisors to rule the case a justifiable homicide and within the bounds of the department's use of force guidelines. The reports did not say how many times McDonald was shot and said McDonald was acting "crazed" and lunged at officers after refusing to drop his knife. Michael D. Robbins, one of the attorneys representing the McDonald estate, said his initial thoughts were that "I didn't think there was a case if he had lunged at a police officer," adding, "The police narrative, without exception, is that the use of force is justified and necessary, which it sometimes is." Chasing Sean and Katie through the woods, Cale is ultimately overpowered by Sean and knocked unconscious. The sound of Cale's gun is also heard by the FBI team, who are able to use the gunshot's noise as probable cause to enter the property. After finding Sean and Katie, the team enters the cabin, where they discover Cale chained up like his victims.
