 Sen. John Kennedy, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is determined to push forward after a public accusation of sexual assault disrupted his confirmation process. Kennedy, who said he spoke to Kavanaugh on the phone Tuesday, described him as "resolute, determined, unequivocal." "He said it's just not true. He wasn't angry, and he didn't say anything bad about Dr. Ford," Kennedy said of his conversation with Kavanaugh in an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow on "CNN Newsroom."  Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh said in written testimony for Thursday's hearing with a woman accusing him of sexual assault that he is facing a barrage of "last-minute smears." "There has been a frenzy to come up with something -- anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious -- that will block a vote on my nomination," Kavanaugh's testimony said. The Senate Judiciary Committee released the testimony Kavanaugh submitted a day ahead of his scheduled appearance before the hearing on an accusation brought by Christine Blasey Ford, who has said he sexually assaulted her at a party in their high school years. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation along with accusations from others who have gone public since Ford.  President Donald Trump worked to wrest his beleaguered Supreme Court nomination back from the brink on Wednesday, insisting during a lengthy and truculent news conference that allegations against Brett Kavanaugh were "all false to me." At the same time, he frankly conceded his mind could be changed after watching a blockbuster Senate hearing set for Thursday morning, when one of Kavanaugh's accusers will detail her claims before the Judiciary Committee and a national television audience. And in a stark moment, he admitted his view of sexual misconduct claims is colored by the litany of charges -- all false, he claimed -- that women have lobbed against him for decades. "I'm going to see what happens tomorrow.
