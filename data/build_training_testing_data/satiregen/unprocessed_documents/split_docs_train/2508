Vidal wanted to re-enter military service in the Army Air Forces during the war but in July 1942 suffered a massive heart attack, spending eight months as a convalescent, which prevented him from serving again. He retired from active participation in his company in the early 1950s but remained a part owner and director of Northeast Airlines. He continued to make furniture and other products out of Weldwood in his home workshop. Stagg attended Yale College, where he was a divinity student, and a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. It is lesser known that he was a member of "The Order of the Skull and Bones," a controversial secret society with members including multiple former U.S. presidents. Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel, but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something, he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper.
