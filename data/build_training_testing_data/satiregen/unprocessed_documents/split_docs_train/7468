The province was enjoying strong economic growth at the time which also vindicated the Conservatives' deficit-cutting measures in the public. The Liberal Party managed to recover some support late in the campaign, but it was not enough and the Tories were re-elected with a second consecutive majority government. Dottie Berger MacKinnon (1942–2013) was a lifelong children’s advocate who raised millions to establish safe havens for at-risk kids. She was a Hillsborough County Commissioner from 1994–1998, serving as its chairman from 1996–1997. She was the co-founder of Joshua House and Friends of Joshua House in 1992, a temporary safe location in Lutz for abused and unwanted children. She helped to create a $1.2 million endowment to ensure that it continues. Note: Many cultures have their own naming customs and systems (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hungarian, Indian and others), some rather intricate. Minor changes or alterations, including reversing Eastern-style formats, do not in and of themselves qualify as stage names, and should not normally be included. For example, Björk, whose stage name appears to be an original creation, is part of her full Icelandic name, Björk Guðmundsdóttir. Her second name is a patronymic instead of a family name, following Icelandic naming conventions.
