The policy change was prompted by attempts to be more inclusive and lawsuits. Atheist parents sued the Boy Scouts of America in 1991 for denying membership in the Cub Scouts to their sons. Considering this news, the Totem Girl Scout Council of Seattle attempted to change the Girl Scout Promise to make mention of "God" optional, which would be more inclusive of local non-theist Native American and Southeast Asian girls. After the national organization asserted this could not be changed locally, the Seattle council advocated that the change be adopted nation-wide.  Goodbye "Boy Scouts." Hello "Scouts BSA." Less than a year after the Boy Scouts of America decided to invite girls to join, the organization announced that it will refer to its older youth program as "Scouts BSA" starting in February 2019. The name change comes amid a new campaign slogan, "Scout Me In," that was made to emphasize the group's expansion from just boys to boys and girls.  Now that girls can join Boy Scouts, it was only a matter of time before siblings started competing with each other to be the best Scout in the family. For 10-year-old Ana Garcia, being around the Boy Scout organization was like a second home for her. She tagged along with her mother to her brother's Cub Scout meetings since she was 5 and watched as he thrived in the program -- learning how to build a campfire and whittle a figurine. Ana built a bird house, went camping and biking with the pack, but she wasn't able to earn the activity pins girls weren't allowed at the time.
