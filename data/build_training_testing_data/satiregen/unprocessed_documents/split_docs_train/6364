In 2017, music critic Jon Caramanica of The New York Times opined that SoundCloud rap "in the last year has become the most vital and disruptive new movement in hip-hop". Todd Moscowitz, the founder of Alamo Records, called the scene a "lo-fi movement" noting the heavily distorted bass and intentional lack of polish in the sound. When Ski Mask the Slump God discussed the lo-fi's genre's sound and recording techniques, he noted that "It was like the worst recording set up,  you could set it up anywhere and that was the wave we were on," and "The raw energy of that – the distortion – is our speciality and we used that to our advantage." Spin noted that the SoundCloud company has not been able to leverage the popularity of SoundCloud rap to improve its financial problems. Dhruva Balram of NME concluded in his review that "Tekashi has released Dummy Boy at the apex of his fame, but at this stage, he's little more than an internet phenomenon and controversy magnet who also raps. Due to his recent arrest, there's a very real possibility that he will spend the rest of his life in jail. That, hopefully, will give him enough time to release a better project." In a more mixed review, M. Oliver of PopMatters remarked that "What Dummy Boy lacks in maturity and creativity it makes up for in energy and vitriol – equivalently bankable features in 2018." Pineiro began his music career as a producer, a hobby he picked up due to boredom. While doing this, he had a major influence in getting his friend Lil Pump into rapping as well. He began to rap when no one bought his produced instrumentals and due to the success of several tracks on the audio distribution platform SoundCloud, Pineiro dropped out of high school in his senior year.
