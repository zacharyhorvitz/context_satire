Gennaro Anthony Sirico Jr. (Italian: ; born July 29, 1942) is an American actor, best known for his role as Paul "Paulie Walnuts" Gualtieri in The Sopranos and various roles in the films of Woody Allen. Those in Tony's closest circle within the DiMeo crime family include Silvio Dante (Steven Van Zandt). Silvio is Tony's consigliere and best friend. He runs the family's strip club headquarters, and other businesses. Paulie "Walnuts" Gualtieri (Tony Sirico), a tough, short-tempered, aging soldier who is fiercely loyal to Tony and Salvatore "Big Pussy" Bonpensiero (Vincent Pastore), a veteran gangster who runs an automotive body shop. Tony eventually accepted his suspicions about Sal after a portentous dream where Sal appeared to him as a talking fish, a clear reference to the Mafia-related saying "Sleep with the fishes". To be certain, he searched for evidence in Sal's home, and found a wire in a cigar box. He then organized a hit on Sal, with Silvio and Paulie, on his boat, with one last toast to the good times, and the three shot him to death, wrapped his body in plastic bags, chains, and weights and dumped it into the ocean.
