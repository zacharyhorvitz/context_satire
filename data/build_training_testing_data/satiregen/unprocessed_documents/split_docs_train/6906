 President Donald Trump, amid fallout over a high-profile White House aide departing due to domestic abuse allegations, touted the role of faith in the United States at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday. The comments come a day after top White House aide Rob Porter resigned his position after multiple domestic abuse allegations. The handling of Porter's departure has raised considerable questions about how chief of staff John Kelly and other top White House aides handled the allegations and whether the top aide was only dismissed because photos of his alleged domestic abuse came to light. Trump, who has taken to touting faith's role in the United States ever since he began running for President in 2015, said Thursday that "our rights are not given to us by man, our rights come from our creator."  Sunday night's semi-destructive revelry was still unfolding on the streets of the City of Brotherly Love when Uber driver and Eagles fan Luis Reyes decided he'd pick up one more fare before heading home. "He asked me to take him to the cemetery so he can place an Eagles cap and to let his dad know that we finally won," Reyes told CNN. It was one of untold bittersweet victory celebrations that since Sunday have blurred the line of earthly time and space to include Philly fans who breathed their last long before time ran out on Super Bowl LII. Reyes' rider asked him to help find the headstone, which had remained unmarked since his dad died in October, the driver said.
