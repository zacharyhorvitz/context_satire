Linda Quiroz plays a woman at home who prepares to make "Hamburger Helper". When she sets the box on the counter top and turns away, the Hamburger Helper Helping Hand materializes out of nowhere next to it. It comes to life, talks to her, and tries to strangle her.

He flirts with her, so she warns him that "no man can have her" unless he can defeat her in a sword fight. Kalidor challenges her and they fight to a draw, despite Tarn trying to knobble Kalidor to tip the duel into Sonjaâ€™s favour. The party arrives at Castle Berkubane and, to protect Tarn, they convince him to stay behind and guard the front entrance.
