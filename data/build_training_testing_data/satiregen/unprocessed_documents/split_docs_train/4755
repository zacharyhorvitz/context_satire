Since then, her every mommy-to-be move and maternity outfit has been scrutinized.  They looked like "a normal couple" as they left the hospital, one bystander said. Of course, most normal couples don't have a crowd of reporters, photographers and random well-wishers waiting for them to show off their new baby. Prince William and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, emerged from St. Mary's Hospital in London on Tuesday evening to give the public its first view of the new heir to the British throne, joking that the still-unnamed boy had more hair than his father. Catherine and William took turns holding the child, wrapped in a cream-colored blanket, as they waved to well-wishers outside.  At long last, the royal baby has arrived.

When will we get the first glimpse of Baby Cambridge?
