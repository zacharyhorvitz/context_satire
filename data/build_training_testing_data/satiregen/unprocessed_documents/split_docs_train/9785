Rai's father is eventually revealed to be a member of Britannian royalty while his mother was a Japanese woman from the Sumeragi clan, the same clan Kaguya Sumeragi belongs to. His mixed-blood status resulted in ill treatment from his other siblings. Hundreds of years ago, in order to protect his mother and younger sister, he bound himself in a Geass contract with an unidentified individual and his Geass ability allowed him to ascend to power. However, during a war with a neighboring country, while he was only trying to raise the fighting spirit of his people in a speech, he lost control of his Geass and accidentally ordered the people to fight to the death against the enemy. In the 2015 drama, Masataka Kubota plays the role of Light Yagami. Similar to the Netflix adaptation, Light is portrayed as less charismatic, insecure and is initially hesitant to kill law enforcement. His relationship with his father Soichiro is also strained due to the death of his mother prior to the start of the series. However, in the later half of the series he grows to demonstrate the same level of ruthlessness, intellect and hubris as his manga counterpart. Li Xingke (黎星刻（リー・シンクー）, Rī Shinkū, pinyin: Lí Xīngkè) is a military officer in the Chinese Federation, said to equal Lelouch in strategy and Suzaku in strength; however, he is limited by a deadly disease that causes him hemoptysis. The son of a low-ranked official, Li climbed his way through the ranks of the government with the intent to transform it. He is fiercely loyal to the young Empress of the Chinese Federation; his devotion stems from when she insisted on sparing his life when he was supposed to be executed for giving medicine to a prisoner. Years later, he was forced to leave the Forbidden City to attend a military academy, but promised the Empress that he would fulfill her wish to see the world beyond the Forbidden City.
