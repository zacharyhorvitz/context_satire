 Bill Clinton reflected in an interview released Friday on his 40-year marriage to Hillary Clinton and some of the "heartbreaks and disappointment" that have shaped her life. His comments came shortly after Donald Trump applauded himself for not bringing up the former president's infidelity at Monday's presidential debate. In an interview with Max Linsky on "With Her," the Clinton campaign's podcast, the former president opened up about how the Democratic nominee has changed since he met her over 40 years ago. "In Hemingway's immortal words: In some way or another, life breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places," Bill Clinton said.  Less than two hours before he was to debate Hillary Clinton Sunday night, Donald Trump tried to wrest control of the political conversation and shove it toward her husband by live streaming an appearance with three women who have in the past accused former President Bill Clinton of inappropriate sexual behavior. Trump's panel included Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones and another woman, Kathy Shelton, whose rapist was defended by Hillary Clinton as a young lawyer. That man was convicted of a lesser charge and served 10 months in jail. All four women attended the presidential debate in St. Louis, as is Bill Clinton.  Donald Trump created an awkward situation during Sunday's presidential debate, where the candidates were free to roam around the stage, and the Republican nominee chose to stand right behind Hillary Clinton. While the Democratic presidential nominee responded to an audience member's question about the Affordable Care Act, Donald Trump uncomfortably stood behind her drawing immediate criticism. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, tweeted, "How you know @realDonaldTrump won the debate: 1) you watched it 2) Hillary (and media) spin will be about him standing behind her #yawn" Here's a look at some of the responses to Trump looming and pacing on Twitter:
