 Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House (R-GA), joins CNN this morning to discuss the defeat of the Republican nominee Mitt Romney in the race to the White House. “I was wrong,” Gingrich admits. “We  all thought we understood the historical pattern with this level of unemployment, with this level of gasoline prices, what would happen. First of all, the president  a very, very effective campaign; second, the president was looking at a very different set of things than what we were looking at.  In the end, the Etch A Sketch didn't work. Mitt Romney, the multimillionaire who touted his business credentials as the Republican presidential hopeful, failed to convince voters that he was the man to unseat President Barack Obama and jump-start the economy. "We have given our all to this campaign," Romney told supporters in his concession speech. "I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader, and so Ann and I join with you to earnestly pray for him and this great nation."  At the end of a long and divisive political season, the speeches of the victor and the vanquished shared similar themes. President Barack Obama, in his victory speech early Wednesday, said, "We are not as divided as our politics suggest." And in his concession speech, Mitt Romney made a similar point, saying, "We citizens have to rise to the occasion." Which prompts a big question.
