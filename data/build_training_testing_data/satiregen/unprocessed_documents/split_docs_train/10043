The 2012 election Libertarian Party presidential candidate, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, received the highest number of votes—more than 1.2 million—of any Libertarian presidential candidate at the time. He was renominated for president in 2016, this time choosing former Massachusetts Governor William Weld as his running mate. Johnson/Weld shattered the Libertarian record for a presidential ticket, earning over 4.4 million votes. Both Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein received significantly more news coverage in 2016 than third-party candidates usually get, with polls showing both candidates potentially increasing their support over the last election, especially among younger voters. Prior to the 2000 election, Steve Vaillancourt, then a two-term incumbent Democratic member of the House of Representatives, switched his party affiliation to Libertarian. Rep. Vaillancourt was successfully elected to the chamber as such and was the only Libertarian member during this period. Prior to the 2002 election, Rep. Vaillancourt switched his party affiliation to Republican. He was re-elected, becoming the first and only member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives to have served under the banner of all three contemporary parties. On May 10th, 2017, following the announcement by Rep. Joseph Stallcop that he had changed his party affiliation and registration to Libertarian, Rep. Dyer announced that the two representatives had re-established the House Libertarian Caucus and made plans to meet regularly in the Legislative Office Building prior to each regular session of the House. In Dyer's statement he declared that the caucus would be open to "any and all legislators who find themselves in a similar situation to where we had found ourselves. The Libertarian Party welcomes all who have the courage and conviction to think and live freely. ".
