 With a lot of facts and figures thrown around the government shutdown and the looming debt ceiling deadline, here are the ones you need to know. 1 -- Week of shutdown: Midnight marked one week since partisan impasse caused a partial government shutdown. House Speaker John Boehner and President Barack Obama aren't speaking to each other -- Obama called Boehner on Tuesday but a Boehner spokesman characterized it as more of the same. They've been trading shots through interviews and via spokesmen and over Twitter.  After 24 hectic hours, Congress was back where it started Tuesday night -- with Republicans and Democrats in the Senate near a deal to end to the U.S. budget standoff, while House Republicans can't agree among themselves. Meanwhile the U.S. government is creeping closer to potentially defaulting on its debt, something the Treasury Department says will happen Thursday if there's no pact to hike the nation's borrowing limit. To this point, the Wall Street bond-rating firm Fitch has warned of a downgrade of gold-plated U.S. bonds, citing the default risk from "political brinkmanship." The economic nightmare from the possible debt default could compound the pain tied to the ongoing partial government shutdown, which enters its 16th day on Wednesday.  Only 61 people in the history of the United States have held the position. It's the second most powerful in the country and second in line to the presidency. But after this week, not many people may want to be Speaker of the House. John Boehner, the chain-smoking, politically moderate, congressman from southwestern Ohio who has held the job for the past three years, has seen his power to corral his Republican caucus tested.
