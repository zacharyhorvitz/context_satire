 Three hours into Mark Zuckerberg's second day of hearings on Capitol Hill, a Republican lawmaker offered "a little bit of advice" to the Facebook CEO: Be careful, or we might just have to regulate you. "Congress is good at two things: doing nothing, and overreacting," Rep. Billy Long, a Republican representing Missouri, told Zuckerberg in a hearing Wednesday. "So far, we've done nothing on Facebook... We're getting ready to overreact." Zuckerberg was grilled for about 10 hours by nearly 100 legislators in the House and Senate to address the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has arrived on Capitol Hill. What happens next could be big. Zuckerberg will spend two days answering lawmakers' questions about the powerful social network he helped create more than a decade ago, and whether the company is doing enough to protect users' privacy. It's the first time Zuckerberg will personally sit for questions from Congress, instead of sending a deputy.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is about to join a short list of chief executives from Silicon Valley who have stepped into the Capitol Hill hot seat -- with mixed success. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday to address data privacy issues in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

In one, the CEO is eaten alive; in the other, he leaves the lion's den unscathed.
