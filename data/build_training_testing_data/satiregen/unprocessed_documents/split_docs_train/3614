 An iconic character is reprised, a rapping girl goes viral, an NBA great drops by during a pop star's concert. These are the videos you don't want to miss this week. A character reprisal Mike Myers brought back his "Dr. Evil" character from the "Austin Powers" movies to poke fun at the revolving doors in the Trump administration.  Former Vice President Joe Biden was denied communion Sunday at a Catholic church in South Carolina over his support for abortion rights. Father Robert Morey, the pastor at Saint Anthony Catholic Church in Florence, told the Florence Morning News that he had denied Biden communion because "any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching." "Holy Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that," Morey said in an email to the newspaper. The Catholic Church, sometimes referred to as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with approximately 1.3 billion baptised Catholics worldwide as of 2017. As the world's oldest and largest continuously functioning international institution, it has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilisation. The church is headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope. Its central administration is the Holy See.
