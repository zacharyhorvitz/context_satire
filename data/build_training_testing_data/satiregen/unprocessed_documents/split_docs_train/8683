Sparkman's body was discovered on September 12, 2009 by attendees of a family reunion paying a visit to Hoskins Cemetery in rural Clay County, Kentucky within Daniel Boone National Forest. He had been reported missing from work three days earlier while working on the American Community Survey for the U.S. Census, covering a local five county area. Sparkman was reportedly found with a rope around his neck, tied to a tree while in contact with the ground, wearing only socks, with the word "fed" written on his chest  in felt-tip marker. It was reported in the media that the word had been written upside-down or from an upside-down point of view and therefore, the police eventually concluded, by Sparkman himself. Preliminary findings of the local coroner indicated Sparkman died from asphyxiation, and the Census Bureau's regional office in Charlotte, North Carolina said law enforcement called it "an apparent homicide". On October 6, Sparkman's body was released to his family, but the State Medical Examiner's Office stated it was not resolving the case. It had only established the cause of death, not the manner of death, and it was still learning "bits and pieces of information". The Kentucky State Police agreed the case was "perplexing". The King County Sheriff is the largest sheriff office in the state. The sheriff in this county, however, has no jurisdiction over the King County Jail as it was separated from his or her control.
