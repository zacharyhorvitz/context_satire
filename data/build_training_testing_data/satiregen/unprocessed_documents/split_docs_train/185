Graeme Tuckett of Stuff.co.nz gave the film two stars, saying that while it "has a handful of moments of genuine comic lunacy... all they really do is highlight the laziness and lack of laughs in the rest of the film." IndieWire reviewer David Ehrlich criticized the script and inability of the film to decide "what kind of dumb it wants to be", giving it a grade of C– and saying that it contained fewer laughs "than the deleted scenes of Step Brothers." David Edelstein of Vulture.com said "Holmes & Watson begins as ineptly as any comedy I’ve seen, and then settles into an agreeably silly groove that had the common hordes around me yukking it up." Jake Wilson of The Sydney Morning Herald was more positive, writing "Holmes and Watson is not for everybody, but if you want to see Ferrell off the leash, this is the best opportunity in a long time." Andrew R. Chow, writing for Time, described the film as "one of the most unexpectedly subversive films of the year." Ram Bergman, the co-producer of Knives Out and Johnson’s longtime collaborator, says that the sociopolitical elements of the film were essential from its infancy. The Latina heroine of the movie, de Armas, saw the film as a major studio release that stars a Latina and condemns entrenched aspects of American society. Carlos Aguilar, writing for Remezcla, said the Thrombey family had a "racist worldview", contrasted by the almost supernatural purity of the Latina heroine as "From the flames of greed, de Armas’ Marta emerges as a heroine for all immigrants and their children whose most inalienable superpower comes from empathy, civility, resilience and the utmost value for human life. It was chosen by the American Film Institute, the National Board of Review, and Time magazine as one of the top ten films of 2019 in each respective list. Director Edgar Wright also stated that Knives Out was his favorite film of the year and that it is "fiendishly plotted".
