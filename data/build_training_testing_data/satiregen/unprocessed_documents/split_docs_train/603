In 1997, it merged with the Greek cruise line Celebrity Cruises and changed its name from Royal Caribbean Cruise Line to Royal Caribbean International. The next year marked a transition to a more "strictly modern line", when the last of the company's older vessels, Song of America and Sun Viking, were retired. In 1998, Vision of the Seas came into service, the last of the Vision-class ships. Following Catchphrase, Weir served as entertainment consultant on board the Celebrity Eclipse as well as other Solstice Class ships, Celebrity Cruises' newest line of vessels. His consulting firm, based in Las Vegas and Miami, helped launch all five Solstice Class ships for Celebrity Cruises and designed the original entertainment programming. Because he had previous experience as a Cruise Director, Weir coordinated the entertainment programs, naming ceremonies and media events in the position of Cruise Director for the first few weeks of each ship's inaugural season. Weir also led the production of the documentary "The Making of Celebrity Reflection - The Fifth in Class" which captured the making of the vessels over an 18 month period. In 1999, the Voyager of the Seas, the line's newest and world's largest cruise ship entered service with much attention from the news media. Two years later, the line took delivery of a second Voyager-class ship, Explorer of the Seas, and the first of a new Radiance class of more environmentally friendly cruise liners, Radiance of the Seas.
