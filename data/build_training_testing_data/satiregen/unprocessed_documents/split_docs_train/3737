On November 21, 2017, Allen said in a court filing that he was the victim of "catfishing" by a man who posed online as several different women. In an emergency motion, Allen was responding to a claim made by the man, Bryant Coleman, that he was being stalked by Allen. Allen became a free agent in the 2014 off-season, and after much anticipation of a return at some point during the 2014–15 season, he announced his decision to sit out the season and focus on 2015–16. However, he did not end up joining a team for the 2015–16 season either. In July 2016, Allen began mulling a comeback, and admitted he was "intrigued" by the possibility of competing for another championship. The following month, Allen had talks with the Boston Celtics and the Milwaukee Bucks regarding a possible return, but ultimately decided to officially retire from the game on November 1, 2016. In his rookie year, Redd was not able to contribute immediately as he was behind NBA All-Star guard Ray Allen on the depth chart. Later on, however, it became apparent that he was better than anticipated as proven by accounts that he had played extremely well against Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson, and other teammates in practice. It was then that former Bucks' head coach George Karl rewarded him with additional playing time. He posted averages of 11.4 points per contest as well as 44.4% on three-point shooting during his second NBA season.
