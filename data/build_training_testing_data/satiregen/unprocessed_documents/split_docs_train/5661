Of Hunt's February 2010 exit, One Life to Live Executive Producer Frank Valentini said, "It was time for Stacy to leave the canvas. Sometimes it's great when the audience hates a character. It keeps them involved and we certainly don't want to make them mad, but some people, you just don't like and yet they're in your world and they do tend to cause some excitement, so that's not a bad thing. It was storyline-dictated and it was time to help propel all of the other characters into major story." Later, Schuyler takes Allison's gun and holds Gigi at gunpoint at the cabin of Victoria "Viki" Lord Davidson, and tries to force Gigi to sleep with him. He once more says that he wants Gigi back in his life, but Rex and the police find them. He attempts to shoot Rex, blaming him for all his problems, but ends up shooting police commissioner Bo Buchanan, who is badly wounded and taken to the hospital for surgery. Brody Lovett arrests Schuyler and takes him to the police station. On 9 September 2019, Kanter made a special appearance at a WWE Monday Night Raw event at Madison Square Garden, where prior to Raw going on the air he defeated WWE 24/7 Champion R-Truth to win the title, though he would lose it back to R-Truth moments later (all of which was shown later during the Raw broadcast).
