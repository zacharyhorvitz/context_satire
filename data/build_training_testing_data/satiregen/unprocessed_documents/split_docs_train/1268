David Bianculli of the New York Daily News was impressed that the episode was filmed in one take and that Gordon Hunt directed it "without a false note". Bianculli felt the episode, despite its "strong" script, would "sink, rather than soar" if it was not for Reiser and Hunt. He also joked that the episode featured more non-stop crying since the broadcast of telemovie The Women's Room. In his review, The Capital's John Martin called the episode "inspired". The sitcom's executive producer Victor Levin wrote the script. He believed an episode focusing on Ferberization, a technique that allows a child to cry itself to sleep, would have "strong emotional ground". Levin spoke with the writing staff and the actors about his idea of Paul and Jamie being unable to leave the doorway to their bedroom, as they listen to their daughter's cries. He explained to Nancy McAlister of The Florida Times Union: "What would be the surprises that would be unearthed if two people sat down just to talk since they've had a kid? "The Conversation" was originally broadcast without interruption from commercials, which were aired at the beginning after the theme song and just before the credits. Levin expressed his gratitude to the NBC network for helping out with the process. He also revealed that the lack of commercials impacted the writing, and he made sure that, despite being one scene, the episode had a beginning, middle and end. He told McAlister that he wanted it to be "as impactful and big feeling" as any show with multiple scenes.
