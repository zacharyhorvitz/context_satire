 It is a very different year - and very different mood -- as Democrats gather for their convention. But there is one carryover from 2008: To win the White House, Barack Obama will once again have to make history. Four years ago, it was a groundbreaking victory for the first African-American to win the presidency. Now, to win four more years, it is a less glamorous but still significant barrier in his way: only Franklin Roosevelt was re-elected with unemployment this high.  President Barack Obama offers a better path forward for the country that will promote united values rather than the winner-takes-all mentality of Republicans, former President Bill Clinton told the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night. In a highly anticipated speech before Obama was formally nominated for re-election, Clinton framed the November vote as a choice of what kind of country Americans want. "If you want a winner-take-all, you're-on-your-own society, you should support the Republican ticket," Clinton said. "If you want a country of shared prosperity and shared responsibility -- a we're-all-in-this-together society -- you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden."  In Charlotte, NC this morning, delegates are rolling in and ready to begin the Democratic National Convention. The Democrats trying to convince voters they are better off now than they were four years ago. But familiar criticism is popping up about the President's resume. Critics are pointing out that he had no experience running a company, noting that Mitt Romney has lots of experience running a company.
