Redbox announced on December 9, 2019 that it would no longer be renting video games, and will continuing selling used video game copies through the end of the year. The boys report the Redbox Killers' crime to the police, and are later reunited with Stan after Kyle's iPad is found and brought to the hospital. The police devise a plan to capture the Redbox Killers by sending one of their own, Peterson, into the Monster Mash as "GangnamStein", an amalgam of Frankenstein's monster and "Gangnam Style" singer Psy. They use Kyle's iPad as GangnamStein's head, with the telepresent Stan providing navigation to Peterson. At one point, Randy commandeers Stan's iPad, sending Peterson on a rampage through town, resulting in him being fatally shot by the police. Randy announces to his family that he has purchased a Blockbuster video store outside of town for $10,000, a venture he believes will make them rich. His family is skeptical of this idea, since online video streaming and Redbox-DVD vending machines have made brick and mortar rental stores obsolete. This is illustrated by the eerie, abandoned-looking store, which houses ghosts, and which the citizens of South Park regard as a haunted house of sorts. Despite this, Randy forces his whole family to work at the store.
