In November, Facebook launched Beacon, a system (discontinued in September 2009) where third-party websites could include a script by Facebook on their sites, and use it to send information about the actions of Facebook users on their site to Facebook, prompting serious privacy concerns. Information such as purchases made and games played were published in the user's news feed. An informative notice about this action appeared on the third party site and gave the user the opportunity to cancel it, and the user could also cancel it on Facebook. Originally if no action was taken, the information was automatically published.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company is investigating a report accusing it of a liberal news bias, but has so far found "no evidence" that it's true. "If we find anything against our principles, you have my commitment that we will take additional steps to address it," he said. Facebook was accused of suppressing conservative news sites and injecting a liberal bias into its Trending topics box, according to anonymous sources in a Gizmodo report earlier this week. "We believe the world is better when people from different backgrounds and with different ideas all have the power to share their thoughts and experiences," Zuckerberg said Thursday.  The recent scandal with Facebook's Trending Topics news module goes deeper than the revelation that it was humans all along hiding behind the algorithm. It should come as no surprise that Facebook has bias -- every organization does. It's what you do about the bias, how you attempt to disclose it and manage it, that makes a difference. News organizations have been grappling with that question for a long time, creating formal and informal codes of conduct, oversight systems and transparency rules.
