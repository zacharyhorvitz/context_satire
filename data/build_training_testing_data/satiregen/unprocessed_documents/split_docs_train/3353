Bud Selig (then-Commissioner of Baseball) said in 2014 that he had never received a complaint about the logo. He has heard that there are some protesting mascots, but individual teams such as the Indians and Atlanta Braves, whose nickname was also criticized for similar reasons, should make their own decisions. An organized group consisting of Native Americans protested Chief Wahoo on Opening Day 2015, as they have for many years, making note that this is the 100th anniversary of the team becoming the Indians. Owner Paul Dolan, while stating he is respectful of critics, says he mainly hears from fans who want to keep Chief Wahoo, and has no plans to change.  The Cleveland Indians are finally parting ways with their Chief Wahoo logo. Beginning in 2019, the team's jerseys will no longer feature the Native American caricature, which has been widely characterized as offensive and racist. The change was announced Monday by Major League Baseball. The Indians had already been shifting away from using the symbol. Chief Wahoo was the primary logo of the Cleveland Indians, a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in Cleveland, Ohio. As part of the larger Native American mascot controversy, it drew criticism from many Native Americans, social scientists, and religious and educational groups, but remains popular among many fans of the Cleveland Indians baseball team. On January 29, 2018, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and Indians' owner Paul Dolan announced that Chief Wahoo would no longer appear on uniforms or stadium signs following the end of the 2018 season. In March 2018, Chief Wahoo was barred from future Hall of Fame plaques, starting with the induction of former Indian Jim Thome.
