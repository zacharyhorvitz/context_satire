Dex Lawson, portrayed by Jason Lewis, was an artist who apparently has an interest in Phoebe in the beginning of season eight, after finding out that she was dead. Phoebe surprisingly has a premonition that they are going to get married. After an overnight trip with him, they get married, but only under the influence of a spell. She has no other choice but to tell him the truth: that she is a witch. Jenny Gordon (played by Karis Paige Bryant) is Dan Gordon's (Greg Vaughan) niece who temporarily moves in with him for school because her parents are in Saudi Arabia on business. While living with her uncle, Jenny forms a bond with the Halliwell sisters and often turns to them for advice on female issues that she is not comfortable talking to her uncle about. Midway through season two, Jenny moves back in with her parents after they return to the United States. Elise Rothman, played by Rebecca Balding, made her first appearance during the season four episode "The Fifth Halliwell". She is the editor and boss of The Bay Mirror, where Phoebe (Alyssa Milano) works as an advice columnist. When Elise first appears in Charmed, her advice columnist is Karen Young (Molly Hagan). At the time, Karen was infected by a demonic power, which made her hate Elise and want to kill her.
