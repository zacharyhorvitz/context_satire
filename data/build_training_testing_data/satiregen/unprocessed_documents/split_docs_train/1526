 Editor's note: President Barack Obama met his challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, Wednesday night in Denver for the first of three presidential debates. CNN contributors and analysts offered these assessments of the evening: (CNN) -- Reihan Salam: Romney scores, but does he have time to turn around campaign? Mitt Romney pressed the reset button last night on his campaign.  While both campaigns have been lowering expectations ahead of Wednesday's first presidential debate, two of Mitt Romney's more notable surrogates raised the bar on Sunday, with one predicting Romney will turn the race "upside down." Both New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. John McCain said they expect Romney to shine when he shares the Denver stage for the first time with President Barack Obama. "We have a candidate who is going to do extraordinarily well on Wednesday night," Chris Christie said on "Face the Nation" on CBS.  The split screen told the story -- when Mitt Romney was speaking, President Barack Obama was looking down; when Obama was speaking, Romney was looking at the president. "It has killed jobs," Romney said during Wednesday's debate about the politically charged health care law pushed by Obama. "Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said, will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance." Romney looked at the crowd, moderator Jim Lehrer and even Obama during the exchange.
