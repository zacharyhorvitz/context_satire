A group of twenty-somethings are planning on going to a club for a night of fun. The following morning, Sara (Tara Reid) accuses fellow clubber Mike (Jerry O'Connell) of date rape. The story of the previous evening is then told through two different points of view, one being how Sara remembers it, and the other how Mike remembers. On January 18, 2010, Reid's boyfriend, Michael Axtmann, an Internet entrepreneur from Nuremberg, proposed to her at The Little Door restaurant in Los Angeles. The couple had reportedly planned an intimate ceremony for summer 2010. On April 20, it was reported that the wedding had been called off and the relationship had ended, with a representative stating: "Tara Reid has confirmed that she will not be moving forward with her May 22 nuptials." Following the success of American Pie 2, Reid starred in a number of commercial and critical misfires including Josie and the Pussycats and Van Wilder. She also starred as the youngest daughter of a Texas gynecologist in Robert Altman's Dr. T & the Women, alongside Richard Gere. She returned to the small screen as a recurring character on the NBC sitcom, Scrubs, appearing in 11 episodes of season three. Shortly thereafter, Reid appeared alongside Ashton Kutcher in My Boss's Daughter, for which she was nominated for both Worst Supporting Actress and Worst Screen Couple at the 2004 Golden Raspberry Awards.
