Busey was born in Los Angeles, and raised in Malibu, California, the son of photographer Judy Busey, and actor Gary Busey. Busey spent his childhood on film sets and touring with bands in which his father sometimes played, such as Leon Russell, Willie Nelson and Little Feat. He began considering his career choices at the age of five when he took up the two hobbies that grew into professions: acting and playing drums. After serving his internship and residency at the University of Michigan, in 1987 he moved to the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he later became head of UCLA's Comprehensive Brain Tumor Program. In 1997, after 10 years at UCLA, he moved to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center  to head the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute. He was also on the faculty of the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine from 1998 to 2003. In 2007 he opened the new Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Both actors were signed by early spring 1986. Gibson and Glover then flew home to pack, and, returning to Los Angeles, began an intensive two months of physical training and preparation. Meanwhile, the crucial role of Joshua was settled when Gary Busey asked for a chance to read for the part. An established star since his Academy Award-nominated performance in The Buddy Holly Story, Busey had not auditioned for a film in years.
