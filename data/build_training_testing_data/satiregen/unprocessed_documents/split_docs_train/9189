The World Trade Center is a mostly completed complex of buildings in Lower Manhattan, New York City, U.S., replacing the original seven buildings on the same site that were destroyed in the September 11 attacks. The site is being rebuilt with up to six new skyscrapers, four of which have been completed; a memorial and museum to those killed in the attacks; the elevated Liberty Park adjacent to the site, containing the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and Vehicular Security Center; and a transportation hub. The 104-story One World Trade Center, the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, is the lead building for the new complex.  Weather has delayed the scheduled Monday morning delivery of the final two sections of a 408-foot spire to the top of One World Trade Center, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The two sections were scheduled to be delivered to the roof deck, as long as weather allowed on Monday. Once they are installed, they will make the building the tallest in the Western Hemisphere, according to the site's management. The two pieces form a stainless steel beacon weighing almost six tons and will be the final piece put in place to give the building an iconic height of 1,776 feet, according to  a news release from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The buildings are among many created by the World Trade Centers Association. The original World Trade Center featured the landmark Twin Towers, which opened in 1973, and were the tallest buildings in the world at the time of their completion. They were destroyed on the morning of September 11, 2001, when al-Qaeda-affiliated hijackers flew two Boeing 767 jets into the complex in a coordinated act of terrorism. The attacks on the World Trade Center killed 2,753 people.
