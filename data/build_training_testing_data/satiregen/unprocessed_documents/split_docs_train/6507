 Marco Rubio struggled on Saturday to fend off a string of searing attacks from Chris Christie as the Florida senator's establishment rivals tried to halt his campaign surge by branding him as too inexperienced and unaccomplished to be president. Rubio appeared seriously rattled by the exchanges at the final Republican presidential debate before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. He repeatedly tried to fight off Christie -- without much effect -- by shifting the focus to President Barack Obama and the Democrats. Donald Trump, meanwhile, was booed during an exchange with Jeb Bush.  The top U.S. commander for the fight against ISIS on Monday slammed the idea of "carpet bombing" the terror group. Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, who directs the coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, provided the most detailed military criticism to date about the concept and detailed why it's militarily unacceptable. "Indiscriminate bombing where we don't care if we are killing innocents or combatants is just inconsistent with our values," he said in response to a question from CNN on the possibility of using carpet bombing. Though MacFarland didn't mention any political candidates by name in his answer, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas while on the campaign trail has called for employing the practice against ISIS.  Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker will endorse Chris Christie on Friday, according to people familiar with his plans, giving a boost to the New Jersey governor's presidential campaign just four days from the crucial New Hampshire primary. After his endorsement, Baker will campaign with Christie in New Hampshire over the weekend, the people said. In Baker, Christie gains the support of a popular northeastern Republican governor the campaign hopes will punch momentum into a contest that he has referred to as the "last stand" of his presidential campaign.
