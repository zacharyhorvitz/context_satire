In 2013, the Capital Grille in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was open for Thanksgiving for the first time in its history. Capital Grille employees at the Pittsburgh location and members of the Restaurant Opportunities Center protested having to work on Thanksgiving without receiving holiday pay. In addition, the Pittsburgh City Council passed a Will of Council opposing Capital Grille's decision to force employees to work on Thanksgiving without holiday pay. The original Capital Grille was founded by Ned Grace, in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1990. The opening was curious for several reasons: the upscale steakhouse contrasted with the then-rundown downtown area of Providence, and the opening occurred amidst an ongoing recession. Grace envisioned the restaurant being popular with business and political elite, and proved to be accurate. Seven years after opening, the original location pulled in over $4 million in annual sales.  In the end, it might not be the DNA evidence collected high atop the Brooklyn Bridge or license-plate checks on the thousands of cars that crossed the iconic span overnight that solve the giant flag caper. In the words of a pair of German artists -- Matthias Wermke and Mischa Leinkauf  -- the replacement of the Stars and Stripes fluttering above the bridge with two massive white flags last month was nothing more than an "art project" by the two performance artists meant to deal with "questions of historical legacy and art in the public sphere." In fact, the NYPD only learned of the artists' possible involvement after their story appeared on the New York Times website Tuesday afternoon. Specifically, a law enforcement official said, the video the artists provided to the Times appeared to show the white flags from a position that would lend legitimacy to their claim.
