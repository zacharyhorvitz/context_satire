Emory and the state of Georgia jointly developed the GMHI. Emory doctors provided some of the mental health services at GMHI, and some residents and fellows received part of their training in psychiatry there. Emory also had its own pediatric psychiatric outpatient programs based at the facility. The university also had 10 faculty scientists conducting 18 research studies at GMHI, focused on mental health, brain and central nervous system diseases. Grady Hospital gained national attention for treating supermodel Niki Taylor after her near-fatal car accident on April 29, 2001 in which she suffered severe liver trauma. The hospital's effectiveness as a level I trauma center has been highlighted by this incident. Several press conferences were held outside the hospital discussing the gravity of her injuries and then her slow recovery following more than 50 surgeries. Emory University Hospital is a 733-bed facility in Atlanta, Georgia, specializing in the care of acutely ill adults. Emory University Hospital is staffed exclusively by Emory University School of Medicine faculty who also are members of The Emory Clinic. The hospital is renowned as one of the nation's leaders in cardiology and cardiac surgery, oncology, transplantation, ophthalmology, and the neurosciences.
