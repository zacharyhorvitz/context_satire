In most jurisdictions, nursing homes are required to provide enough staff to adequately care for residents. For example a state may require that a nursing homes  have at least one registered nurse available for at least 8 straight hours a day throughout the week, and at least a licensed practical nurse on duty 24 hours per day for up to 100 residents. Understaffed facilities are one common causes of nursing home neglect due to the staff's inability to meet the needs of all residents. As part of her visits to nursing homes, Fraser encouraged residents to form their own councils to lobby for their rights. She also created a "residents' rights Bingo game" that teaches residents and staff about their rights in a fun way. More than 7,000 copies of the game were purchased by nursing homes across the United States. Fraser later suggested a project to stitch a "residents' rights quilt" at one of the largest nursing homes in the state. Together with his deputy General Hans Oster, military jurist General Karl Sack, theologian Rev. Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Ludwig Gehre, Canaris was humiliated before witnesses. Canaris was led to the gallows naked and executed on 9 April 1945 at the Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp, just weeks before the end of the war. A prisoner claimed he heard Canaris tap out a coded message on the wall of his cell on the night before his execution, in which he denied he was a traitor and said he acted out of duty to his country.
