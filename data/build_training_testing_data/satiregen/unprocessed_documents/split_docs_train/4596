 Nobody likes to hear that an old friend is "brain dead," so perhaps it's not surprising that France's allies seem to be going through the seven stages of grief over Emmanuel Macron's pronouncement in the Economist last month that NATO is languishing. There was first shock and denial. Speaking alongside NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on November 7, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she disagreed with the French President's description of the 70-year-old alliance. "I don't think such a sweeping judgment is appropriate," she said. The missionary Joseph Oldham played a key role in getting the survey under way. John Cell has argued that reference to Jan Smuts in Lord Lothian's foreword to the work should not be given much weight. Smuts had advocated White settlement throughout the highlands of East Africa, with a view of creating a similar dominion to South Africa. This proposal, centred on Oxford University lost out to other viewpoints.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is far from being brittle, but the alliance seems much less elastic than it once was. When its leaders gather this week in London they will need to stretch hard to bridge some of their differences. US President Donald Trump doubts the alliance's purpose while French President Emmanuel Macron doubts its future. Alongside those two, we now have Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is flouting its most basic tenets.
