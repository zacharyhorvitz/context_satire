To add tragedy to folly, a balcony collapsed during a game at the Baker Bowl in 1903, killing 12 and injuring hundreds. Rogers was forced to sell the Phillies to avoid being ruined by an avalanche of lawsuits. In 1904 the team finished with a record of 52â€“100, making them the first team in franchise history to have lost 100 games. Baker died in 1930. He left half his estate to his wife and the other half to longtime team secretary Mae Mallen. Five years earlier, Mallen had married leather goods and shoe dealer Gerald Nugent. With the support of Baker's widow, Nugent became team president. On October 24, 2019, the Philadelphia Phillies announced Joe Girardi as their 55th manager of the Philadelphia Phillies signing a three-year deal with the team with an option for the 2023 season.
