 It's an all-too-familiar pattern in American politics: In the wake of mass shootings, support for stricter gun laws spikes temporarily. But that shift in public opinion largely fades over time, and Congress doesn't pass anything. The inaction bubbled into outbursts of frustration from Democrats on Monday, after at least 58 people were killed in a Las Vegas shooting. "The thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with continued legislative indifference," said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a leading gun control advocate since the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in 2012.  Vigils are being held across the US for victims of Sunday's shooting in Las Vegas, which left dozens dead and hundreds injured. National and international landmarks went dark as a show of respect to the victims of the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Much of the Las Vegas Strip, where the shooting occurred, went dark Monday night, as did New York's Empire State Building. "Tonight our lights darken for the victims and those affected by the Las Vegas attack," the New York landmark said on Twitter, adding that an orange halo would be displayed to "(shine) a light on gun violence."  Gun stocks rose Monday following the deadliest mass shooting in American history late Sunday night. A gunman in a hotel room at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas killed at least 58 people attending an outdoor concert and wounded over 500 more. Shares of Sturm Ruger were up 4%, while American Outdoor Brands, the company formerly known as Smith & Wesson, gained more than 3%. A company named Olin, which owns the Winchester brand of ammunition, rose 6% to an all-time high.
