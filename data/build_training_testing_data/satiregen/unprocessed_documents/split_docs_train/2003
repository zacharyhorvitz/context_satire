Sarah, nicknamed "Paradise" by Bo, was the first member of the Gordon family to arrive in Llanview. While she was only on the show for a short time, she was a part of many memorable storylines, including Mendorra and Badderly Island. Born off-screen in 1965 to Roger and Carrie Gordon, Sarah grew up as the second of three daughters and came to Llanview in October 1987. As a therapist specializing in training newly-blind people to live without their sight, Sarah became a counselor to Clint Buchanan, who had been blinded by a gunshot wound to the head. In 1986, when Cord expressed an interest in photography, Maria sent Clint a telegram asking him to provide Cord a job at The Banner. Tina was in the midst of a bitter feud with Clint at the time. She intercepted the request and snooped about in El Paso, hoping to get some dirt on him. Cord met and quickly fell for Tina Clayton, and followed her back to Llanview. Al Roberts died of cancer very soon after Cord wed Tina. With no-one keeping her in El Paso, Maria relocated to Llanview to be near her son. By then, she had grown strong enough to hold her own against Asa's threats. Eventually she confessed to both Clint and Cord that they were father and son, and Clint welcomed Cord into the Buchanan family.
