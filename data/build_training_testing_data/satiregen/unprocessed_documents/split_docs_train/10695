 As world powers are gathering in Vienna this week for a final round of nuclear talks with Iran, Western diplomats put their chances of a comprehensive deal at 50 percent at best and a breakthrough before the Nov. 24 deadline appears highly unlikely. While an accord might not be met by next Monday's deadline, diplomats say it is possible to agree on the outline of a deal. They say an extension of the talks to resolve the remaining issues and work out the details is the most likely scenario. Though nobody is talking publicly yet about the prospects for an extension, one senior administration official said a continuation of the talks was far preferable to a total collapse of the process.  The United States might extend a deadline to reach a comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear program, a senior State Department official told CNN. International negotiators in Vienna, Austria, are scrambling to reach a deal by Monday's deadline. "It is only natural that less than 48 hours from the deadline we are discussing a range of options," the official said. "An extension is one of those options."  A new deadline for a political framework agreement for Iran's Nuclear talks has been set for March 1, 2015, a Western diplomat tells CNN on Monday, with a deadline for final agreement including annexes on July 1. Negotiators had been scrambling to reach a deal on Iran's nuclear program before a Monday night deadline. The negotiators included representatives from Iran and the P5+1 countries -- the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain), plus Germany. The parties involved will release a statement Monday citing "good progress" from their talks in Vienna, a Western diplomat told CNN.
