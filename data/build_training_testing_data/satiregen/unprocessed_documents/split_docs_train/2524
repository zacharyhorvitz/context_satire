 The Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Wii U consoles all let players control games with motion -- but you wouldn't know it from the games the console makers are promoting. At this year's E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, the only mention of motion control came in the form of a few concept demos and Microsoft's announcement of Kinect Sports Rivals. Sony didn't make a peep. And despite the fact that developers have had a year to make sense of Nintendo's Wii U GamePad, which comes complete with motion sensors and a touchscreen, not a single game on display at Nintendo's booth used those technologies in a manner resembling anything interesting.  It hasn't been a blockbuster year for Nintendo, the video-gaming company that brought us "Donkey Kong," "Super Mario Bros." and the Wii. Sales of the Wii U, Nintendo's latest gaming system, have been soft and the company has struggled to get enough top-tier games in front of the players clamoring for them. And while Microsoft and Sony have made headlines at E3, the video game industry expo underway this week in Los Angeles, Nintendo has kept a lower profile, forsaking its usual splashy keynote in favor of a smaller news conference. But Satoru Iwata, president and CEO of Nintendo, believes the company can rebound by focusing on Wii U games.  Much of the focus this week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the video game industry's big annual trade show, will be on Microsoft and Sony, which both have new game consoles coming in time for the holiday shopping season. But the spotlight inside the Los Angeles Convention Center won't be so much on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 as what's really important: the games themselves. With these two next-generation consoles on the near horizon, game developers are in a transitional period between the new devices and the ones that people enjoy in their homes right now. Many of the titles featured during E3 may be playable immediately, with a next-gen option down the road.
