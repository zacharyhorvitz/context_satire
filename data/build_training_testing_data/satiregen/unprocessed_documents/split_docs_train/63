NICE has been criticised for being too slow to reach decisions. On one occasion, the Royal National Institute of Blind People said it was outraged over its delayed decision for further guidance regarding two drugs for macular degeneration that are already approved for use in the NHS. However the Department of Health said that it had 'made it clear to PCTs that funding for treatments should not be withheld simply because guidance from NICE is unavailable'. The International Association of National Public Health Institutes (IANPHI) is a member organization of NPHIs that currently has members from 61 countries. IANPHI helps link the NPHIs of the world, so that they can share knowledge and experiences, in addition to providing support for NPHI development in low-resources countries. The majority of funding for IANPHI comes from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. According to Fox News, the General Accounting Office reported, in January 2012, that officers in the National Institutes of Health Police had lower salaries than comparable Police Departments. A new officer in the United States Capitol Police earned $61,000 a year, while a new officer in the National Institutes of Health Police started at just $39,000.
