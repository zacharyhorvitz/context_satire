 Special counsel Robert Mueller has released a January 2017 memo detailing the FBI's interview that month with Michael Flynn -- a moment that led to a high-profile criminal case against the former Trump national security adviser. In the interview described in the memo, Flynn lied about his contact during the presidential transition in 2016 with then-Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. At times, Flynn offered the FBI agents more benign descriptions of what he and Kislyak had said about Russian policy. In all, the newly released memo shows clear examples of Flynn denying he had made policy requests of Russia, and the agents prodding him toward fuller descriptions of the calls.  The House Intelligence Committee voted Thursday to send the transcript of its 2017 interview with Roger Stone to special counsel Robert Mueller, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Rep. Mike Conaway, a Texas Republican on the panel, said the committee approved it unanimously by voice vote. Conaway told reporters ahead of the vote that Mueller had made a request for a transcript from the committee, though he didn't specify which interview. The move dramatically raises the legal stakes for Stone, who has faced growing scrutiny in the special counsel investigation, and would suggest a heightened interest by federal prosecutors in one of President Donald Trump's closest allies.  Special counsel Robert Mueller's team continues to be interested in interviewing the President Donald Trump, two sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. Mueller's stance on interviewing the President has been constant for a year and a half, one of the sources said. "Nothing has changed in that sense from the first day," the source said. Trump and his lawyers are still opposed to any interview.
