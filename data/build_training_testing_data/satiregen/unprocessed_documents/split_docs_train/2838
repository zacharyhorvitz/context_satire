Story of Seasons, known in Japan as Bokujō Monogatari (牧場物語, lit. Ranch Story), and formerly known as Harvest Moon, is an agricultural simulation role-playing video game series created by Yasuhiro Wada and produced by Victor Interactive Software (acquired by Marvelous Entertainment in 2003, now Marvelous Inc.). Story of Seasons was the first game to be released under the new international series title of the same name. Money is obtained by growing crops, raising livestock, fishing, mining, and foraging. With a limited time and limited energy, the player has to find a balance between the two in order to accomplish their work for the day. Planting, growing, and harvesting crops is one of the main focuses of the Story of Seasons series. The crops available to plant include turnips, potatoes, corn, and strawberries, and they can be purchased in the village during their respective season. To plant crops, the player must till the soil, plant the seeds, then water the plots. Several crops will yield multiple vegetables throughout the season if continually watered.
