In a contemporary review for the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot found N.W.A. 's music "fuller and funkier" than Public Enemy's and their lyrics just as "unforgiving". The Orange County Register noted the explicit language on the album, noting that it made fellow rapper Ice-T "look like a Cub Scout". The review concluded that the album was "curiously uninvolving" and that it "lacks the insight and passion that put the best work by the likes of Boogie Down Productions, Ice-T and Public Enemy so far ahead of the field". The lyrics on the album were written by Ice Cube, MC Ren, and The D.O.C. Some critics of the album expressed their view that the record glamorized Black-on-Black crime, but others stated that the group was simply showing the reality of living in the areas of Compton, California, and South Central Los Angeles. Steve Huey in a retrospective review for AllMusic feels that the lyrics are more about "raising hell" than social criticism, but also feels the album is "refreshingly uncalculated" due to its humorâ€”something he feels is rare in hardcore rap. While reporting for ABC News, Compton traveled around the globe and through all 50 states with presidents, vice presidents, and first ladies through seven presidential campaigns, and, as a White House correspondent, she covered seven presidents, beginning with Gerald Ford. Weeks after the Watergate scandal came to an end, Compton became the first woman assigned to cover the White House on a full-time basis by a network television news organization, and she was one of the youngest to receive the assignment.
