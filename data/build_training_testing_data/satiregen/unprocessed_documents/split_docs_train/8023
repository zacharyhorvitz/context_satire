 About a third of the way through his 90+-minute speech at a campaign rally in North Carolina on Wednesday night, President Donald Trump began to attack Somali-born Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar. It was a continuation of a series of racist tweets he had sent over the weekend in which he urged Omar -- as well as three other liberal, non-white, female members of Congress to go back where they came from. Amid Trump's onslaught on the freshman Democrat on Wednesday, the North Carolina rally crowd began to chant "Send her back! Send her back!"  President Donald Trump on Wednesday intensified his attacks on four progressive Democratic congresswomen, painting them as the face of the Democratic Party -- as a fevered crowd chanted "Send her back!" about an American congresswoman of color. Trump spent a significant portion of the rally railing against the group, known as "The Squad" on Capitol Hill, individually by name. That line of attack has become a strategy he and aides believe will cast the Democratic Party as a far left, radical group.  This week started with the furor caused by President Donald Trump's racist tweets urging four Democratic congresswoman of color to go back to where they're from. (In the case of three of the four that would mean going back to, uh, America.) With the middle of the week came chants of "Send her back!" -- aimed at Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, a naturalized US citizen who was born in Somalia -- during a Trump rally in North Carolina.
