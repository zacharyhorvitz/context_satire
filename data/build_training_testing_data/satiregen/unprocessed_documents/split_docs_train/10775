The film tells the story of a woman feeling unfulfilled and unappreciated in her life so she decides to abandon her husband and infant daughter in order to pursue her dreams of superstardom. The story starts off by showing aspiring vocalist, Olivia King (Diana Ross) performing at small lounge in Atlanta, Georgia in 1981. As she takes a break from her performance she heads backstage to see her infant daughter, Kayla (Jayda Brown). A music executive approaches King at the bar and tells her she is talented and should move to the bigger market of New York City to fulfill her dreams. The movie then picks back up in St. Louis, Missouri, 18 years later, and it is shown that Kayla Harris (Brandy Norwood), now 19 years old, has won a contest to meet famous superstar Olivia King. Kayla at this time does not know that Olivia is her mother, but she grew up being a huge fan of Olivia King and is extremely excited to meet her idol, completely ignorant to the truth. After enjoying the concert, Kayla then gets the second part of her prize which includes having dinner with Olivia King. At dinner, Kayla lets Olivia know that she also would like to be a singer and invites Olivia to a small performance she would be doing. On 6 May 2018, it was reported that Kayla is the daughter of Neil Clifton (Ben Cartwright), who was involved in Bethany's grooming storyline in 2017. Kayla keeps her identity a secret, suggesting that she could seek revenge on Bethany and Craig, who helped convict Neil. Kayla gives Craig her phone number, upsetting Bethany. It was reported that Bethany would suffer flashbacks of her encounters with Neil and would struggle to move on after being faced with "a daily reminder of the horror of what she's been through."
