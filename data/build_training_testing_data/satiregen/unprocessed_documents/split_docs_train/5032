The input hypothesis, also known as the monitor model, is a group of five hypotheses of second-language acquisition developed by the linguist Stephen Krashen in the 1970s and 1980s. Krashen originally formulated the input hypothesis as just one of the five hypotheses, but over time the term has come to refer to the five hypotheses as a group. The hypotheses are the input hypothesis, the acquisitionâ€“learning hypothesis, the monitor hypothesis, the natural order hypothesis and the affective filter hypothesis. The input hypothesis was first published in 1977.The hypotheses put primary importance on the comprehensible input (CI) that language learners are exposed to. Heatley's National Service was deferred because he was working in the farming industry (an "essential service" that allowed a period of exemption), but he eventually signed up in October 1954 at the age of twenty. He served in the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, working with horses and dogs, and came out of the army as a corporal. His training and fitness declined while he was in the military and it had a detrimental effect on his running. In 1962, having taken an extended break from marathon running, Heatley came to the conclusion that his best hope of winning an Olympic medal before his retirement was to focus his efforts on the marathon event at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. He confessed that he was not keen on the marathon, saying it was "just a bit too far" for him; he preferred the shorter distances, particularly the 10-mile run.
