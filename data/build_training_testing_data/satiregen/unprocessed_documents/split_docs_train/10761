Grandma featured briefly in the film, Thunderbird 6, but has no dialogue. She does not appear in the 2004 live action film at all, instead being replaced by a new character called Onaha, who was Kyrano's wife and Tin-Tin's mother. Grandma returned in the 2015 remake Thunderbirds Are Go, portrayed by Sandra Dickinson; in the new show, she was one of only three people to know of the Hood (the others being Jeff and Kayo). She has a noticeably different personality: she is noticeably tougher than her original counterpart, has taken over the role of head of the family following her sonâ€™s disappearance, and is a terrible cook. Shortly after winning the Parola Sands Race, her grandson Alan Tracy picks her up so she can move to Tracy Island. Unfortunately, a racing competitor of Alan's takes revenge and Grandma finds herself having to sit still on a bridge spanning the San Miguel River with Alan due to a bomb that has been placed under the bridge to exact revenge. If either of them moved, the bomb would detonate. She and Alan are rescued by her grandsons, allowing Grandma to see first hand the work that her family did, and she moved into the Tracy home ("Move And You're Dead"). Although having existed for decades, grandma pizza was not well known outside of Long Island and many in New York did not even know about the style. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the pizza become more popular with many pizzerias offering it. This was mainly due to people who had grown up eating grandma pizza finally being able to open up their own pizzerias and offer the pizza as a sign of respect and homage to what they ate.
