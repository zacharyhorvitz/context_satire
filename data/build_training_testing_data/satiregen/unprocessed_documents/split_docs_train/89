Northampton Town Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Northampton, England. The team play in League Two, the fourth tier of English football. The club nickname is "The Cobblers", a reference to the town's historical shoe-making industry. They play their home games at the 7,798 capacity all-seater Sixfields Stadium, having moved from the County Ground in 1994, where they had played since their inception. They were inspired by another early Merseybeat band The Ravens, who later became Faron's Flamingos. The Dennisons advanced from learning the Ravens' chord patterns, to building a local reputation at the BICC club in Melling, Liverpool. They signed with Kennedy Street Enterprises in 1963, which ensured that they appeared at The Cavern Club, sharing bills with other aspiring acts such as The Beatles. Their original bass guitarist, Alan Willis, was then replaced in December 1962 by Terry Carson (1946â€“1991). The Dennisons were an English Merseybeat band, that emerged from the Liverpool scene in the early 1960s. Despite their background, and a couple of minor hit singles, they failed to achieve more than a local following and were unable to find a footing on the British Invasion. However, in 1963, Bob Wooler stated that "The Dennisons have created the biggest impact in Liverpool since the Beatles." The band's drummer, Clive Hornby, later became the actor best known for portraying Jack Sugden in British soap opera Emmerdale.
