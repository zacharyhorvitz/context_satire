In January 2011, it was confirmed that One Direction had been signed by Cowell to a reported Â£2 million Syco Records record contract. One Direction's debut single, "What Makes You Beautiful", bowed at number one on the UK Singles Chart in September 2011, and their first studio album, Up All Night, was released two months later. One Direction became the first UK group to have their debut album reach number one in the United States. The album featured a multitude of writers, but included three songs written by Styles and his groupmates. Taylor Swift is the self-titled debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 24, 2006, by Big Machine Records. Swift was 16 years old at the time of the album's release and wrote its songs during her freshman year of high school. Swift has writing credits on all of the album's songs, including those co-written with Liz Rose. Swift experimented with several producers, ultimately choosing Nathan Chapman, who had produced her demo album. Tom Roland of Billboard wrote that "the country landscape is much different today, thanks in part to Swift and her insistence on following a game plan that many considered unorthodox" and added that "country is viewed much more favorably in the current media landscape than it was when Swift debuted in 2006". In another article, Billboard stated that following Swift's rise to fame, labels have increasingly become interested in signing singers who write their own songs and young country artists. BBC stated that Swift paved the way for crossover artists, "forging a path for artists who no longer wish to be ghettoised into arbitrarily separated musical genres". In 2020, The Herald opined that ukuleles are "enjoying a resurgence in popularity as stars such as Taylor Swift bring it to a modern audience".
