 Senior Editor, People Magazine Michelle Tan is on 'Starting Point' with John Berman and Christine Romans on Angelina Jolie's first public appearance after her preventive Double Mastectomy at the premiere of her partner Brad Pitt's new film 'World War Z' in London. Jolie was glowing on the Red Carpet after revealing she underwent the procedure four months ago in a New York Times op-ed. On Jolie's decision to come forward publically about her double mastectomy, Tam claims she has 'really spoken out, and really made these issues come to the forefront,' for so many women who are faced with the decision to have a Double Mastectomy. Jolie's candor on this very personal issue has made her and Brad Pitt more 'human,' and has revealed the 'incredible bond' the couple shares.  At the premiere of "World War Z" in London, star Brad Pitt and his fianc√©e, Angelina Jolie, were feeling "great" -- if not also a little emotional. Sunday's event marked Jolie's first public appearance since she revealed in May that she'd had a preventive double mastectomy this year, and the press wanted to know how she's been since her New York Times op-ed about her choice went viral. "I feel great," Jolie told the BBC. "I feel wonderful, and I'm very, very grateful for all the support. As a public figure, Pitt has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry.

From 2000 to 2005, he was married to the actress Jennifer Aniston, and from 2014 to 2019, he was married to the actress Angelina Jolie. Pitt and Jolie have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.
