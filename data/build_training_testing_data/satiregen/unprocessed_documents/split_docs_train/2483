In 2005, prior to the airing of "Felony Flight", Ann Donahue stated that "you never know" when a three-way crossover will be produced, with Zuiker stating that "the beauty of this franchise is it's very interchangeable in terms of how crossover combinations will work". In 2009, CBS commissioned a three-part crossover starring CSI: Crime Scene Investigation star Laurence Fishburne, an event that EW dubbed the "Great CSI Crossover Experiment That William Petersen Never Would Have Agreed To". The Miami segment of the crossover, titled "Bone Voyage", aired on November 9, 2009. CBS president Les Moonves had announced in January that a Miami spin-off was imminent, yet "It wasn't until we sort of, like, at the eleventh hour, really started to look at our options as to who was going to play Horatio,  revisited Caruso. And  said, 'Yeah, we'll have him come out for dinner, see what he's about.'" Caruso was later cast as Caine. He was the last pilot cast member to be contracted to series. Anthony Zuiker described the event as "virtually a movie", while CSI: Miami's show-runner Ann Donahue stated that, despite a crossover being planned earlier, she had "held off on this because  wanted to wait until 'New York' had distinguished itself" from its predecessors. Zuiker noted that as well as being a "tremendous treat for viewers", the crossover would provide "a chance to sample other CSI shows and casts and mysteries on other nights", particularly due to the "complete visual makeover" undertaken during CSI: NY's second season, "in terms of the lighting style, the colors, and the new labs." He also described the crossover as " the event that the franchise needed at this point, not only for CSI: NY, but  the viewers. And it's, I feel, some of our best work if not the best."
