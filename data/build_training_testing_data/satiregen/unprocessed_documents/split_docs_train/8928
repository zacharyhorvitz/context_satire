The company also released an e-mail sent to Apple employees in which CEO Tim Cook announced Jobs' death, saying, "Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being.

Praising Jobs' breadth and the impact of his work from personal computers to iPhones to movie production, the president added, "Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last.
