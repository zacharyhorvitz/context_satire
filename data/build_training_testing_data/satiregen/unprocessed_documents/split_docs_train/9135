At Extreme Rules in June, Wyatt failed to become number one contender for the Universal Championship in a fatal five-way match, as the match was won by Samoa Joe. After Seth Rollins was unveiled on the cover of WWE 2K18, Wyatt targeted him and defeated him both at Great Balls of Fire in July and again on the following Raw. In the following weeks, Wyatt began a feud with Finn Bálor, resulting in a match between the two at SummerSlam in August, where Bálor defeated Wyatt under his "Demon King" persona. Wyatt again lost to Bálor at No Mercy the following month. Western historian and author John Boessenecker describes Earp as an "enigmatic figure  ... He always lived on the outer fringe of respectable society, and his closest companions were gamblers and sporting men  ... Wyatt never set down roots in any one place; when the money stopped coming in or his problems became too great, he would pull up stakes and move on to the next boomtown  ... For his entire life was a gamble, an effort to make money without working hard for it, to succeed quickly without ever settling in for the long haul. :178 He wrote a letter to John Hays Hammond on May 21, 1925, telling him "notoriety had been the bane of my life. I detest it, and I never have put forth any effort to check the tales that have been published in which my brothers and I are supposed to have been the principal participants. Not one of them is correct. ":135
