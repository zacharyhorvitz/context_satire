Thicke, noting that all three male singers are married and have children, said that the Diane Martel-directed video was tongue-in-cheek. When defending the song on NBC's The Today Show, the 36-year-old singer explained that encouraging conversation about the song's content was his intention, saying "It's actually a feminist movement within itself. It's saying that women and men are equals as animals and as power". After its banning at University College London, Thicke declared the song was about his wife, and that after 20 years together, he indeed knew she wanted it from him. The judges had the power in various weeks to choose one or more celebrities to be safe from voting and move forward to the following week's round. The celebrity with the lowest votes from the viewers would be eliminated from the competition. The judges panel consisted of DMC, Da Brat and Big Boy. The hosts were comic Kevin Hart and radio personality Liz Hernandez. In 2005, Robin Thicke married actress Paula Patton after dating for over a decade. On February 24, 2014, the couple announced their legal separation, saying in a statement, "We will always love each other and be best friends, however, we have mutually decided to separate at this time." In the months following the announcement, Thicke made several attempts to repair their marriage and began dedicating his 2006 song "Lost Without U" to Patton during his concerts. He then premiered the song titled "Get Her Back", written about her, at the 2014's Billboard Music Awards, and a month later, he announced that the title of his seventh album would be Paula, after the actress.
