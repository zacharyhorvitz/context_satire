 A federal judge Tuesday night ruled it is illegal to post blueprints for 3D-printable guns online, but hundreds of designs reportedly were downloaded before the judge's decision, meaning those designs are out there -- legally or not. Judge Robert Lasnik, siding with states that argued the postings could help criminals and terrorists manufacture such weapons, temporarily blocked a settlement that would have allowed Defense Distributed, a Texas-based gun rights organization, to legally post blueprints for 3D-printable guns. "This is a nationwide ban. ... In November 2011, the U.S. House passed legislation that would require states that issue concealed gun permits to recognize similar licenses from other states. The bill was supported by the National Rifle Association which considered it to be a top priority, but opposed by the NAGR on the basis that it could become a "Trojan horse for more gun control".  The Trump administration supports an existing law they say makes it illegal to own or make homemade plastic guns, a White House official said Tuesday, coming hours after President Donald Trump tweeted that the availability of the firearms "doesn't seem to make much sense!" "The President is committed to the safety and security of all Americans; he considers this his highest responsibility," deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said to reporters aboard Air Force One. "In the United States, it's currently illegal to own or make a wholly plastic gun of any kind, including those made on a 3D printer." The administration supports the three-decade-old law, Gidley said, "and will continue to look at all options available to us to do what is necessary to protect Americans while also supporting the First and Second amendments."
