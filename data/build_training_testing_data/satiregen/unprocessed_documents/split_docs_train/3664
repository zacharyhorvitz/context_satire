 Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, knows something about secrets and what happens when they're exposed. He has some advice for Edward Snowden, who recently leaked information about the extent of U.S. electronic surveillance programs. "I would strongly advise him to go to Latin America," Assange told CNN's AC360 Monday night. "Latin America has shown in the past 10 years that it is really pushing forward in human rights.  A recent spate of disasters, including the Oklahoma tornadoes, the Boston bombing and the fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas, has people across the country reaching for their wallets to help out. But, if past trends are any indication, residents in some states tend to be a lot more generous than others. Utah, home to the nation's biggest Mormon population, is also the most charitable state, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy's most recent report that looks at giving as a percentage of discretionary income -- your income excluding essential expenses. Mormons are supposed to tithe at least 10% of their income to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the median donation among Utah households lines up with that requirement -- amounting to $5,255 per household, or 10.6% of discretionary income.  It's a glaring number in a national poll that's making headlines. President Barack Obama's approval rating dropped 8 percentage points over the past month to 45%, the president's lowest rating in more than 18 months, according to a CNN/ORC International survey released on Monday. And Obama's disapproval rating soared 9 points to 54% since mid-May. CNN Poll: Obama approval falls as controversies pile up Even more surprising: The overall decline in his approval rating was partially fueled by a plunge in support from younger Americans, a huge base of Obama's support.
