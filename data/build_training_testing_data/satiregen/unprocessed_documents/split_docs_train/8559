 American companies operating in China expect slower revenue growth, investment and expansion this year, according to a survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in China. The tempered expectations underscore just how challenging U.S. firms can find conditions in the world's second biggest economy. The survey found heightened concerns over intellectual property, the safety of proprietary data and government-sponsored campaigns against foreign firms operating in the country. Forty-one percent of respondents said they felt less welcome in China than before, and only 11% said they felt more at home.  Concerns about the Chinese economy hit global stocks Wednesday and could make for a weak start on U.S. markets. U.S. stock futures were modestly lower ahead of a quiet day in terms of U.S. economic and corporate news. Big swings in some commodities reflected the nervousness about the pace of growth in the world's second biggest economy. Gold prices pushed higher while copper prices fell to their lowest level in at least a year.  Copper prices are tumbling on fears China's slowing economy could push more companies into default and flood markets with metal used to finance their debt. A small solar firm last week missed an interest payment to investors -- the first default of its kind for China -- signaling a new willingness by Beijing to allow companies to fail as it works to reform the world's second biggest economy. More defaults are expected to follow, and while experts say this will ultimately be healthy for China, it's causing some market turmoil in the short term. Copper has dropped 4.3% since Monday in New York -- hitting its lowest level since July 2010 -- with falls also seen on markets in London and Shanghai.
