Hahn killed her last victim, Georg Obendoerfer, on August 1, 1937, after he traveled to Colorado Springs, Colorado with her and her son. Police said that Obendoerfer, a cobbler, "died in agony just after Mrs. Hahn had bent over his deathbed inquiring his name, professing she did not know the man". Hahn's son testified at her trial that he, his mother, and Obendoerfer traveled to Colorado by train from Cincinnati together and that Obendoerfer began getting sick en route. On the March 31, 2011, episode of Live with Regis and Kelly, Regis Philbin was "answering" a letter asking for advice on how to propose. The lights dimmed just before Inaba's boyfriend, Jesse Sloan, appeared on stage. With violinists playing in the background, Sloan, bent on one knee, asked for Inaba's hand, to which she responded "Yes! I will marry you!" Born to Gustave and Elfreda Hahn, Hahn attended Ann Arbor HS before heading off to NC State. He missed his sophomore year due to academic reasons, but the 6'10 senior returned for the 1948-49 seasons. He left NC State and played in for the Chicago Stags in the NBA. After his short stint with the Stags, he toured with the Globetrotters in Europe and Africa.
