The character has even entered the Congressional Record. During the presidential transition of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell referenced the character in a December 2016 speech to the Senate floor delivered in tribute to Biden. McConnell said, "When The Onion ran a mock photo of him washing a Trans Am in the White House driveway shirtless, America embraced it. And so did he." Later that year, Car and Driver magazine asked Biden, "Sadly, we must ask about the Onion story. While shirtless, have you ever washed a 1981 Pontiac Trans Am in your driveway?" He replied, "You think I'd drive a Trans Am? I have been in my bathing suit in my driveway and not only washed my Goodwood-green 1967 Corvette but also simonized it. Created by Onion writer Chad Nackers, the character was developed over the course of the real Biden's two terms as Vice President of the United States between 2009 and 2017. Although the newspaper had first mentioned Biden in 2006, he had never been the focus of an Onion piece until the character's debut, which coincided with Obama and Biden's inauguration in January 2009. Nackers and others have recognized the character's true debut as the May 2009 article "Shirtless Biden Washes Trans Am in White House Driveway", which was the first full-length treatment of the character. Since then, the Biden character has appeared in more than 50 Onion articles and numerous videos.
