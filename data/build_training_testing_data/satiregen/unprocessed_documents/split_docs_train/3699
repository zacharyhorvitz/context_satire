 Former President Barack Obama's nine-month break from politics is officially over. And he's not happy with what he sees. The question is: Are Democrats listening? In New Jersey and Virginia Thursday to campaign for Democrats ahead of November's state-level elections, Obama drew direct contrasts between his own vision of politics and President Donald Trump.  Ever since the 2012 elections, Democrats had looked to the 2018 Senate map with a sense of dread. The numbers are singularly daunting: 25 Democratic seats up as compared to just nine Republican seats. Of those 25 Democratic seats, 10 are in states that President Donald Trump won in 2016. Half of those are in states Trump won by 10 points or more.  A group of Democrat lawmakers is pressing the government's chief ethics agency for answers on Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross's financial disclosures. The request to the Office of Government Ethics was prompted by a story in Forbes last week that raised the possibility that Ross should have disclosed assets worth $2 billion before his confirmation earlier this year. "It is imperative that Congress and the Office of Government Ethics know the full extent of Mr. Ross's holdings to ensure he is not putting personal gain ahead of the interests of the American people," the six lawmakers, led by Senator Richard Blumenthal, wrote to David Apol, acting director of OGE. Apol did not reply to an email seeking comment.
