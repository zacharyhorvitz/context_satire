Trump, who owned the Miss Universe franchise, which includes the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants, was also accused to have walked into dressing rooms of contestants while they were in varying stages of undress without prior notice of his arrival. Trump has said in an interview with Howard Stern in 2005, "no men are anywhere. And I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant. And therefore I'm inspecting itÂ ... Is everyone OK?  Now that his lawsuit against Univision has been settled, Donald Trump says he is happy to tape an interview with the network's star anchorman Jorge Ramos. "We're going to do an interview with Jorge," Trump said at a Friday night rally. On Saturday he tweeted about it, but then deleted the comment later in the day. A spokesman for Ramos declined to comment, but another person close to him said talks are underway about a possible interview.  Donald Trump escalated his battle with Ted Cruz on Monday, calling the Texas senator "unstable," threatening a lawsuit and urging the Republican National Committee to "intervene." "One of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President," Donald Trump said in a statement. "If he doesn't take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately. Additionally, the RNC should intervene and if they don't they are in default of their pledge to me. "
