In March 2019, PolitiFact reported that Ocasio-Cortez is "one of the most targeted politicians for hoax claims, despite the fact that she just entered Congress as a freshman". Fake quotes attributed to her, fake photos of her, and false rumors about her have spread on social media. Some of these have originated from 4chan and r/The_Donald. By July 2019 the fake material included attributing things Trump said to Ocasio-Cortez, such as "I have a very good brain and Iâ€™ve said lots of things." After Navarro's departure in early 1998, Red Hot Chili Peppers were on the verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, "The only way I could imagine carrying on  is if we got John back in the band." Kiedis was surprised and thought there was no way Frusciante would ever want to work with him again, as the two still had unresolved issues from when Frusciante quit in 1992. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. In a January 2020 interview with Ultimate Guitar, Klinghoffer spoke briefly for the first time about his departure from the band. Klinghoffer said that he could not go into detail about his departure but when asked if there was any hard feelings between him, the band or Frusciante, he responded by saying "I don't think so. Not from me." In an interview with Marc Maron on his Spotify podcast WTF with Marc Maron that same month, Klinghoffer said that it was a "pretty simple" decision to split with Red Hot Chili Peppers and there is "no animosity" between himself and the band.
