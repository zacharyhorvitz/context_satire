He admits that there was no owl and speaks of "them", but cannot remember anything further, but does say that he knows why Tommy did what he did. Later, he insists she come to his home to hypnotize him, to get something seemingly horrific out of his head.

In June 2014, Universal Pictures announced they had acquired the rights to distribute Hail, Caesar!, a heavily fictionalized comedic film very loosely based on Mannix's career. Hail, Caesar! was released on February 5, 2016. Joel and Ethan Coen wrote and directed the film, and Josh Brolin portrayed Mannix. After the inaugural race, organizers improved the marking of the trail for the first contest held in the Whitehorseâ€“Fairbanks direction.
