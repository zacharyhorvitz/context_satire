Shortly after her graduation from the Academy of Law in 2102 at age eighteen, Judge Hershey joined the crew of the spaceship Justice 1 for the dangerous deep-space mission to find the Judge Child, who had been abducted by the Angel Gang. Two years later, during the Apocalypse War, Hershey was called upon again by Judge Dredd to join his "Apocalypse Squad" for a daring commando raid which ended the war. Randolph Whitely, a.k.a. "Whitey" was the first perp to appear in the Judge Dredd strip, in 2000 AD prog 2. He murdered the first judge to appear in the strip, Judge Alvin, prompting Dredd to arrest him and sentence him to life on Devil's Island: a prison with no need for walls as it is located on a traffic island where the traffic never stops and attempting to cross the road means certain death. Judge Grice was a street judge who conspired to assassinate Judge Dredd in order to prevent the 2113 referendum about the future of the Justice Department. He was arrested and sentenced to 20 years in the penal colony on Titan, but two years later – in his own series, Purgatory – he escaped. He attacked Mega-City One and killed millions with a weaponised virus before Dredd killed him.
