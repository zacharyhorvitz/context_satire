 A series of new firearm laws go into effect in Texas on Sunday, just hours after a shooting left seven people dead in the western part of the state. The laws will further loosen gun restrictions in a state that's had four of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern US history, including the El Paso shooting last month, when a gunman stormed a Walmart and killed 22 people. The new measures were all passed during the 2019 legislative session, which ended in June. Here are the sweeping firearm laws going into effect:  Weapons on school grounds  House Bill 1143 says a school district cannot prohibit licensed gun owners, including school employees, from storing a firearm or ammunition in a locked vehicle on a school parking lot -- provided they are not in plain view.  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued eight executive orders aimed at preventing more mass shootings in the Lone Star State, his office announced on Thursday. The orders come less than a week after a shooting rampage in West Texas left seven people dead and a month after 22 people were killed at a Walmart in El Paso. On Sunday, new laws went into effect in the state that loosen gun restrictions.  Federal investigators on Wednesday searched a Texas home as part of the investigation into the sale of a weapon used in a shooting rampage that killed seven people and wounded 25, two law enforcement officials told CNN. The home in Lubbock is associated with the alleged seller of the firearm used by the gunman, who went on a killing spree in and around Odessa, an official said. The investigation into the gun sale highlights one of the loopholes in the patchwork of federal gun laws. Because the sale was a so-called private sale, the seller isn't required to conduct a background check on the buyer, which is required in sales by licensed gun dealers.
