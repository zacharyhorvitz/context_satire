Tales from the Loop is an upcoming American drama television series based on the narrative art book with the same title by Simon Stålenhag set to premiere on Amazon Video. On February 27, 2020, it was announced that the series will premiere on April 3, 2020. In June 2018, it was announced that Amazon had secured the UK rights to broadcast 20 live Premier League football matches from the 2019–20 season on a three-year deal. This will be the first time that the league will be shown on a domestic live streaming service, as opposed to being shown exclusively on television. Amazon first announced that it would create computer games in 2014. Amazon recruited Kim Swift (Portal, who has since left for EA), Clint Hocking (Far Cry 2), and developers who previously worked on System Shock 2. Amazon sought to make games in-between the industry standards of small and large teams making casual and AAA games, respectively. Amazon Game Studios wanted to make teams of five to thirty people who would work on games for between a year and 18 months with a focus on "creativity" and "craftsmanship", whether the genre is for kids or hardcore gamers.
