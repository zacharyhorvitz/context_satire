Morning is the period of time from sunrise to noon. There are no exact times for when morning begins (also true for evening and night) because it can vary according to one's lifestyle and the hours of daylight at each time of year. However, morning strictly ends at noon, which is when afternoon starts. Morning can be defined as starting from midnight to noon, or from sunrise (which varies throughout the year) to noon, or from when one wakes up to noon.Morning precedes afternoon, evening, and night in the sequence of a day.  Before they go to Mars, rovers like NASA's Mars 2020 and the European Space Agency's ExoMars missions need to be equipped to study the Red Planet and collect samples. So where's the best Mars on Earth? These researchers think the closest analog is Chile's Atacama Desert. The Martian surface is harsh, a dry, cold, irradiated environment.  Scientists have long suggested that if life exists beyond Earth, the processes behind it may be entirely different from everything we know. On Thursday, researchers announced that they were able to create a DNA-like molecular system that can store and transmit information. It's not a life form, but the genetic system represents what an alternative to DNA-based life may resemble. It could also help scientists keep a different picture in mind when searching for life elsewhere in the universe.
