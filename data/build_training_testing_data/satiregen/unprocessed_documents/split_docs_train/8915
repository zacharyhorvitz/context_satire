 Kurdish forces guarding a US military base in northern Syria told CNN they feel they've been betrayed by their American allies after US President Donald Trump cleared the way for a Turkish operation against them. "The Americans sold us out and we do not expect them to help us fight the Turkish troops," one Kurdish fighter told CNN, as a US flag fluttered over the base. US personnel at the base in northern Syria said they could not speak to CNN due to the sensitive nature of their work here. But, based on comments from the Kurds protecting the base, their relationship has become strained.  The situation in Syria has been rapidly deteriorating. Last week, the Trump administration ordered US troops to step aside from the border in northern Syria, effectively paving the way for Turkey to launch an offensive against US-backed Kurdish forces who they regard as enemies. Here's where things stand today: Deal struck: Kurdish forces near the northern Syrian border have struck a deal with the Syrian government, marking a major shift in the country's eight-year war. About Turkey's military offensive: Turkish forces launched attacks on the Syrian border last week.  Can anyone make sense of President Donald Trump's Syria policy, other than Donald Trump? Not much will bring senior Republicans to push back against Trump, but his decision to pull American forces out of Syria has drawn condemnation from three grandees of the GOP: Sen. Lindsey Graham, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. And for good reason: Pulling the 1,000 or so American forces out of Syria makes no sense. Those troops are not there on a combat mission but only in an advisory role to prevent the return of ISIS and also to provide some US leverage over events in Syria, whose regime is supported by Russia and Iran.
