 Neil Gorsuch has made it all the way to the hallowed hallways of the Supreme Court. Gorsuch took his official oath to become the ninth justice in a short ceremony Monday morning, before a public ceremony later at the White House. Now, after a lifetime of preparation and several grueling weeks as a nominee, he starts his tenure as the junior-most justice. The new guy. The Supreme Court initially had its seat at the Chamber of Princes in the parliament building where the previous Federal Court of India sat from 1937 to 1950. The first Chief Justice of India was H. J. Kania. In 1958, the Supreme Court moved to its present premises. Originally, the Constitution of India envisaged a supreme court with a chief justice and seven judges; leaving it to the parliament to increase this number.  Sen. Jeff Merkley spoke for more than 15 hours from the Senate floor, laying out his arguments overnight against Neil Gorsuch ahead of a tense showdown over President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee at the end of the week. The Oregon Democrat's marathon -- with a brief assist from Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois early Wednesday morning â€” wrapped up shortly after 10 a.m. ET. "I was hoping the message would reach a few hearts across the aisle that we're on a path we have not completed -- the seat has not been stolen, we're potentially a couple of days away from that," Merkley told reporters after he left the Senate floor.
