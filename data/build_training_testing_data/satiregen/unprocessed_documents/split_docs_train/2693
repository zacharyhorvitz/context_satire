Escaped convict and former Marine Lee Benson (Judson Scott) and his accomplice Brad Hixx (Robert Gray) go to Hazzard, because Lee is out to settle a score with Luke. While Luke and Lee were in the Marines, and Luke was a sergeant, Benson was robbing his best friend's foot locker, and he walked in on Benson doing it. Luke came in and found that Benson had stabbed the man, but not killed him, so Luke had Benson locked in the brig for a couple of years. Now, Benson wants Luke to pay for that. The Duke family lives in Hazzard County, Georgia. Their patriarch is Jesse Duke, a farmer and former moonshiner who's very wise, and probably the most trusted person in six counties; his nephews, Bo and Luke, and his niece, Daisy, live on the Duke farm with him. Jesse raised Bo, Luke, and Daisy after their parents died in an auto accident. The Duke family had been making moonshine for generations. Boss Hogg hires a pair of thieves named Vic (Michael Greene) and Corey (Alex Kubik) to steal tractors and other heavy equipment from various farmers that Boss had given out loans to. Boss loaned them the money to buy the equipment seven years ago, when interest rates were low. Now that interest rates are higher, Boss feels like he is losing about 15% a year. Boss is having the equipment stolen from the farmers and brought to himâ€”he sees it as a way to recoup his losses.
