In Chris Coyne's (bass player of The Godfathers) words: "When we were looking for a producer, we remembered "Dirty Love", the b-side of the "Ace of Spades" single. The sound was just incredible, so we rang up Vic expecting this Lemmy-like biker figure but he turned out to be a quiet, unassuming sort of bloke - a real diamond geezer." Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times praised Coppola's efforts to follow the storyline of the eponymous novel, the choice to set the film in the same time as the novel, and the film's ability to "absorb" the viewer over its three-hour run time. While Ebert was mainly positive, he criticized Brando's performance, saying his movements lacked "precision" and his voice was "wheezy." The Chicago Tribune's Gene Siskel gave the film four out of four stars, commenting that it was "very good." The Village Voice's Andrew Sarris believed Brando portrayed Vito Corleone well and that his character dominated each scene it appeared in, but felt Puzo and Coppola had the character of Michael Corleone too focused on revenge.
