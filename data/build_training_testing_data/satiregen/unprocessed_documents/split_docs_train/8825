 British Columbia is what many pundits consider to be the complete opposite of a bellwether region. British Columbia has a history of voting against the government. This has meant the NDP in the 1980s and the Reform/Canadian Alliance in the 1990s. More recently, regional trends have started to appear in B.C.  Ontario was predicted to be the battle ground of this election. Most pundits believed that this is where the election was lost for the Conservatives. Ontario is home to more than one third of all of Canada's ridings. In the last three elections, right wing vote splitting has resulted in just six riding losses for the Liberals, compared to 299 riding wins. Northern Saskatchewan has also been a traditional two-way race between the NDP and the Conservatives. The NDP with their strongest support in the riding of Churchill River. However, the most recent 2000 election saw this riding pass to the Liberals. More recent elections have seen the Reform/Canadian Alliance do extremely well here, and are expected to do just as well, or even better as the new Conservative Party.
