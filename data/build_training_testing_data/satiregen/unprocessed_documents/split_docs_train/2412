Columbine High School opened in 1973 with a capacity for 1,652 students. It was named after the surrounding community of Columbine, which in turn was named after the state flower of Colorado: the columbine. The school's first principal was Gerald Difford. There was no senior class during the school's first year; its first graduating class was in 1975. The original Caledonia High School building now serves as the grade school. During the 2002-03 school year, the new Middle/High school building was finished. In the 2009-10 year, Paul DeMorett took over administration of the school, and in 2012-13, Ben Barton took over as the superintendent.
