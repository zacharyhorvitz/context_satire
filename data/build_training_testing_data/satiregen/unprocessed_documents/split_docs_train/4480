 Sen. Bernie Sanders may win the Democratic Iowa caucuses a week from today. But he lost the coveted Des Moines Register endorsement to fellow liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren over the weekend. And, in explaining why they opted for Warren over Sanders, the Register's editorial board hits on a key question that the Vermont democratic socialist will need to answer in the coming weeks and months. Wrote the editorial board: "While Elizabeth Warren and Sanders are in lockstep on many positions, concerns about Warren's potential for divisiveness are magnified with Sanders. After the speech, the head of National Nurses United, the first national union to back Sanders, said, "What we know about Bernie is that he will be there. Heâ€™s always been there as a fighter in the Senate, but that he will continue to be there for us. But most importantly, his message was, we have to be there, we have to build a movement, we have to fight." In July, in an effort to win Sanders's endorsement and his supporters' approval, Clinton endorsed several new policies he had advocated for, including plans to eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities and to increase spending for community health centers.  Sen. Bernie Sanders apologized to fellow 2020 contender Joe Biden for an op-ed by one of his campaign surrogates that suggested the former vice president has a "corruption problem." "It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way. And I'm sorry that that op-ed appeared," the Vermont senator told CBS News. The op-ed, written by Zephyr Teachout and published on Monday in The Guardian, argued that Biden's "record represents the transactional, grossly corrupt culture in Washington that long precedes Trump" and would give Trump the "perfect foil."
