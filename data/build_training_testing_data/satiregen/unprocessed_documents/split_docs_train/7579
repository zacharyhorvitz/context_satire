Mary-Kate Olsen (born June 13, 1986) is an American fashion designer, former actress and producer. She began her acting career one year after her birth, sharing the role of Michelle Tanner with her twin sister Ashley Olsen in the television sitcom Full House (1987â€“1995). They also starred in numerous films together. The production team behind Full House did not want people to know that Michelle was played by a set of twins, so the girls were credited as "Mary-Kate Ashley Olsen" for most of the show's run (making it appear as if a single actress had the first name Mary-Kate and the middle name Ashley). Although the two were credited separately as "Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen" during the closing credits in the series' first season (they were not officially added to the opening title sequence until season two but were credited in the syndicated versions of the season one opening titles), it was not until the eighth and final season that the twins were credited as "Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen" in the opening titles. Despite the fact that the Olsens are fraternal twins, their physical appearances were nonetheless similar enough so that few could tell the difference between the two over the course of the show's run. In season one, Mary-Kate was used more often due to the fact Ashley cried when she was put on set for a scene. Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen (born June 13, 1986), also known as the Olsen twins as a duo, are American fashion designers and former child actresses. The twins made their acting debut as infants playing Michelle Tanner on the television series Full House. At the age of six, Mary-Kate and Ashley began starring together in TV, film, and video projects, which continued to their teenage years. Through their company Dualstar, the Olsens joined the ranks of the wealthiest women in the entertainment industry at a young age.
