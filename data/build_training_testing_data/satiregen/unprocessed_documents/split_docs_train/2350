 On the heels of the devastating attack in Nice, people are taking to Twitter in an attempt to get information about their missing loved ones. On Thursday, a truck rammed through a crowd of people celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, France. More than 80 people have died and many others remain in critical condition. Those who haven't seen or heard from family and friends in the area are desperately posting photos and descriptions in the hopes of crowdsourcing any information about them.  Scores of people were killed Thursday night when a large truck plowed through a Bastille Day crowd in Nice, France, in what President Francois Hollande called a terror attack. The death toll grew through the night, with Hollande saying 77 people died. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said 80 people were killed. The driver first shot a gun into the crowd before driving two kilometers along the Promenade des Anglais, the main street in Nice, mowing down people who had gathered to watch fireworks, regional President Christian Estrosi told CNN affiliate BFM-TV.  The postcard perfect French coastal resort of Nice seems an unlikely flashpoint for extremist violence, but this week's deadly attack spotlights a dangerous undercurrent of radicalization. Nice is known for its beaches and traditional architecture, but law enforcement and experts on terrorism say its suburbs are unhappier places that have recently become breeding grounds for Islamic militancy. That appears to have reached a deadly crisis point with the attack on a Bastille Day holiday crowd that left more than 80 people dead and others critically injured. The incident follows previous extremist strikes in France -- including November 2015's massacres in Paris and January 2015's attack focused on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo -- that have plunged the country into a state of emergency.
