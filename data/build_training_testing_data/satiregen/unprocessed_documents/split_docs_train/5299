The New European  is a British pro-EU weekly newspaper owned by Archant that began publication on 8 July 2016. Launched as a response to the United Kingdom's 2016 EU referendum, its readership is aimed at those who voted to remain within the European Union, with the newspaper's original tagline being "The New Pop-up Paper for the 48%". Citizenship of the European Union (EU) is afforded to qualifying citizens of European Union member states. It was given to the citizens of member states by the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, at the same time as the European Community was gaining its own legal identity. The treaty established a direct legal relationship between that new legal identity and its citizens by establishing a directly elected European Parliament and the ability for citizens to bring cases directly to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Kirchberg, Luxembourg, and has been in force since 1993. European Union citizenship is additional to national citizenship. European or western cuisine is the cuisines of Europe and other Western countries, including the cuisines brought to other countries by European settlers and colonists. Sometimes the term "European", or more specifically "continental" cuisine, is used to refer more strictly to the cuisine of the western parts of mainland Europe. East Asians contrast Western cuisine with Asian styles of cooking, the way Westerners refer to the varied cuisines of East Asia as Asian cuisine. The cuisines of Western countries are diverse, although there are common characteristics that distinguish them from those of other regions.
