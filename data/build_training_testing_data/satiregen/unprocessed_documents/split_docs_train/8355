According to the report, the mass dismissal of September 25 had not been Broadus' decision, but was ordered by Thirer. The dismissed players had been involved in several incidents reported to BU police earlier in the month. Fine had been suspected of smoking marijuana in his dorm, but was not charged even though he appeared to be high. Mayben had been cited for speeding and possession of marijuana that he said belonged to Fine. On February 11, Kaye released her findings in a 99-page report. Kaye found that under pressure from Broadus, Binghamton had lowered its standards for admitting basketball players to the NCAA minimum. In bowing to this pressure, Kaye said, DeFleur (who had announced her retirement a month earlier), Thirer and other officials had significantly compromised Binghamton's academic standards even though Binghamton was not prepared to take in so many academically marginal students. Basketball players had been given credit for courses titled "Theories of Softball" and "Bowling I". The Kaye report was forwarded to the NCAA, which could have issued its own sanctions in addition to Binghamton's own decision to pull out of postseason play. On October 18, the NCAA found that Hsu had committed two secondary violations by providing impermissible travel to two players. However, due to lack of cooperation from involved parties, the NCAA was unable to find any major violations. At the same time, Broadus was reinstated to the athletic department.
