In "How the Mighty Med Have Fallen", the Annihilator plans to obtain the quantum chip that contains the secret files of every superhero. It turned out that the quantum chip is in the form of a sour cream and onion potato chip that Kaz and Oliver ate, which the Annihilator and Skylar plan to get it out of their stomachs. When the Annihilator plans to cut Kaz and Oliver open in order to get the quantum chip, he and Skylar are tricked into using the forestation on them for Horace. Titanio arrives with a cadre of superheroes to fight the Annihilator. In "The Mother of All Villains", Bridget makes her final plans for her wedding to Horace at a local hotel. While Horace and Alan are busy, she sends a call to Mort to find the Arcturion. Bridget then goes around collecting the phones so that they can't disrupt the wedding. Due to Bridget mentioning a call from her employer Mort, Kaz, Oliver, and Skylar secretly figure out that Bridget is actually Mr. Terror. The overall accuracy of the polling data from the 2006 elections was cited, both by those who argue that the Bradley effect has diminished in American politics, and those who doubt its existence in the first place. When asked about the issue in 2007, Douglas Wilder indicated that while he believed there was still a need for black candidates to be wary of polls, he felt that voters were displaying "more openness" in their polling responses and becoming "less resistant" to giving an accurate answer than was the case at the time of his gubernatorial election. When asked about the possibility of seeing a Bradley effect in 2008, Joe Trippi, who had been a deputy campaign manager for Tom Bradley in 1982, offered a similar assessment, saying, "The country has come a hell of a long way. I think it's a mistake to think that there'll be any kind of big surprise like there was in the Bradley campaign in 1982.
