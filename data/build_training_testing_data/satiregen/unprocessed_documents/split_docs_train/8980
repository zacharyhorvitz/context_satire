Another popular children's book, Would You like to Play Hide & Seek in This Book with Lovable, Furry Old Grover?, had Grover trying different ways to hide from the reader, eventually getting upset and begging the reader to just say "no" they do not see him, even though he was just crouching down in a corner. In the 1971 children's book The Monster at the End of This Book, Grover goes to great effort to keep the reader from turning the pages of the book, because there is a monster on the final page. Grover nails pages together and builds a brick wall to block access; at the end it is discovered that the monster at the end of the book is Grover himself, who is mortified ("Oh, I am so embarrassed..."). The late 1990s saw a sequel to the book where Grover desperately tries to stop Elmo from reaching the end of the book, eventually directing him to leave the book and enter from the back. Therefore, when both of them reach the end, they wind up scaring each other. Grover's jobs have ranged from a taxi driver and a photographer to a flight attendant and singing telegram artist. One sketch parodied the ABC television series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition in a segment where Grover began remodeling Mr. Johnson's home despite his express wishes. In another one, Mr. Johnson is the only patron, and Grover is the only actor, for a production of Spider-Monster: The Musical, a parody of the musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. The play is, of course, a complete calamity and finally comes crashing down on both of them.
