 Steve Bullock won the endorsement of Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller on Thursday, the governor's campaign announced, making the Montana Democrat the first presidential candidate to win the support of an Iowa Democrat elected statewide. Miller's endorsement of Bullock is not a surprise. The longtime attorney general has long been a supporter and has quietly boosted the governor's campaign in Iowa long before Tuesday, when Bullock officially jumped into the race. "I'm proud to endorse Steve Bullock for President of the United States," Miller says in a campaign video.  Steve Bullock knows he's late to the 2020 dance, but nothing he's seen so far has scared him away from joining the party. "Voters in Iowa and everywhere else don't want to make a fast decision, they want to make the right decision," Bullock said as he set off across the state to introduce himself as one of the newest Democratic presidential hopefuls. With Bullock, the governor of Montana, in the race, along with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, the party's field of candidates is now large enough to suit up a football team of offense, defense and one player to spare. For Bullock and many contenders, even though they may be reluctant to say so out loud, it's Iowa or bust.  Joe Biden is set to shift into a new -- and riskier -- phase of his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. After entering the race three weeks ago as a stronger-than-expected front-runner, the former vice president is set to deliver a speech at his first major rally of the race Saturday in Philadelphia. Then, Biden and his aides have said, he'll begin rolling out policy proposals. And, he said, he will soon likely begin preparing for the Democratic presidential debates.
