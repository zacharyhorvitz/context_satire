 Repealing Obamacare won't be that easy. Replacing it will be even tougher. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to dismantle Obamacare as one of his first acts after taking office. Yet he can't eliminate Obamacare on day one with the stroke of a pen.  These are the voices that aren't being heard. Often drowned out amid all the cries to repeal Obamacare are the stories of those whose lives now depend on the health care reform law. I asked CNNMoney readers on Thursday to write me if they were concerned about losing Obamacare. My inbox was quickly flooded with hundreds of responses from Americans desperate to say how crucial Obamacare coverage was to them and their families and how much they feared the Republicans' plan to dismantle it once President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January.  Americans signed up for Obamacare in droves Wednesday, right after Donald Trump -- who has vowed to dismantle the program -- was elected President. More than 100,000 selected plans through the federal Obamacare exchange, healthcare.gov, according to the Department of Health & Human Services. It was the busiest day since open enrollment began on Nov. 1, when around 95,000 signed up. Administration officials are using the data point to promote the importance of Obamacare to Americans, trying to counter Republicans' assertions that it is pricey and broken.
