 Ohio delayed the scheduled executions of a dozen inmates on Monday, citing difficulties getting the necessary drugs. The next execution in Ohio is now set for January 2017, according to a release from the state's Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (DRC). "DRC continues to seek all legal means to obtain the drugs necessary to carry out court ordered executions, but over the past few years it has become exceedingly difficult to secure those drugs because of severe supply and distribution restrictions," the release read. "The new dates are designed to provide DRC additional time necessary to secure the required execution drugs." Ohio  (listen) is a state in the East North Central region of the Midwestern United States. Of the fifty states, it is the 34th largest by area, the seventh most populous, and the tenth most densely populated. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus. Ohio is bordered by Lake Erie to the north, Pennsylvania to the east, West Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, Indiana to the west, and Michigan to the northwest.  Five bodies, four crime scenes. They add up to what Ohio's Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty calls one "serial killer." And that may just be the beginning. "So far, we know (Robert Rembert) purposefully executed five people," McGinty said in a press release.
