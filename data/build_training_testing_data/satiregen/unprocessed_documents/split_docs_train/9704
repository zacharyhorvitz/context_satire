 President Donald Trump will visit El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in the coming days, following mass shootings in the cities over the weekend, the White House confirmed on Monday. Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway told reporters at the White House on Monday that Trump will travel to Dayton and El Paso, she said, to express his condolences and help provide resources. Trump wants to hear more, she said, from the mayors of the cities and those directly affected. Conway did not specify which day Trump would go but El Paso Mayor Dee Margo, who did not meet with Trump during his last trip to the city, earlier this year, said he would meet with the President while he visits Wednesday to discuss his community's specific needs in his capacity as mayor.  President Donald Trump is traveling Wednesday to the scenes of back-to-back mass shootings that stunned the nation and left at least 31 people dead, but his appearances in Ohio and Texas aren't being well received by all local officials -- some of whom say it would be best if the commander in chief avoided their grief-stricken cities. Trump, traveling with first lady Melania Trump, landed in Dayton, Ohio, on Wednesday morning and spoke to those wounded and their families at Miami Valley Hospital. Trump landed in El Paso, Texas shortly after 4 p.m. ET (2 p.m. MT).  Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren on Sunday said President Donald Trump should not "wink and nod and smile" about white supremacy in the wake of two mass shootings in the US in the span of 13 hours -- one massacre that involved a white supremacist suspect. "White supremacy is a domestic terrorism threat in the same way that foreign terrorism threatens our people," the Massachusetts Democrat told CNN's Don Lemon on "CNN Tonight." "And it is the responsibility of the President of the United States to help fight back against that. Not to wink and nod and smile at it and let it get stronger in this country."
