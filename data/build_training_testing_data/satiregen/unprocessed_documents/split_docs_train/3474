This was disputed by Gates in an interview with Larry King in which she seemed very gullible. While she was aware that people in Hollywood were trying to protect Hudson's reputation by spreading lies about her, some of her answers didn't make sense. At one point, she told King she still doesn't know if Rock Hudson was gay and also claimed to 'forget' that Hudson liked to dance ballet sans clothing. Gates also acknowledged she had been the one to initiate the divorce  based on her husband's behavior. David was born in the neighborhood of Sheepshead Bay, in Brooklyn, New York City. His parents are Rose (born Regina Brandes) and Mortimer Julius "Morty" David, a men's clothing manufacturer, and he has an older brother named Ken. David's family is Jewish. His father's side moved from Germany to the U.S. during the 19th century, while David's mother was born into a Polish-Jewish family in Tarnopol, now in Ukraine. Ellison moved to Chicago's South Shore, then a middle-class neighborhood. He remembers his adoptive mother as warm and loving, in contrast to his austere, unsupportive, and often distant adoptive father, who had adopted the name Ellison to honor his point of entry into the United States, Ellis Island. Louis Ellison was a government employee who had made a small fortune in Chicago real estate, only to lose it during the Great Depression.
