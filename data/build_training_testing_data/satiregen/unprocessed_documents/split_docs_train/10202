The Samsung SPH-i300 was an early Palm OS-based smartphone manufactured by Samsung. It was released around 2001. It was marketed in the United States for use on Sprint's mobile phone network. It was the first "PDA phone" (as devices that combined phone and PDA functions were then called) in the US with a color screen. Samsung is only displayed on the phone's casing and Sprint is only mentioned on-screen when the battery is improperly inserted. When the phone is turned on, the message "WELCOME" is shown, and when the phone is turned off, the message "GOOD BYE" is shown, in a manner reminiscent of Neo's first encounter with the Matrix. Three screensaver themes that come with the phone are Reloaded, The Animatrix and Camera, even though the SPH-N270 cannot be used as a camera. Several ringtones from the first two Matrix films can be selected along with a beep option and a vibrate option. The Samsung SPH-N270 or Matrix phone is a bar style mobile phone released in 2003, made to resemble the phone used in The Matrix Reloaded. The design crew of the Matrix worked closely with Samsung to develop a phone whose features and release date would coincide with the movie. The SPH-N270 was not intended as a mainstream phone for everyday use. Instead, it was marketed solely to fans of the series as a piece of rare, high quality merchandise.
