After signing a contract with A&M Records and not wanting to release her own first attempt at a debut record thinking it was unmemorable, Crow finally released Tuesday Night Music Club in 1993. It remains her most successful effort to date and one of the best-selling albums of the 1990s, having sold more than ten million copies internationally by the end of the decade. Such hits as "All I Wanna Do", "Strong Enough", and "Can't Cry Anymore" garnered Crow's popularity on radio, while Tuesday Night Music Club became a Billboard 200 mainstay, rising from the debut spot at number 173 to its peak in the top five and spending exactly 100 weeks on the chart. The album also saw success in countries such as Australia and Canada and throughout Europe. Crow opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, wearing a shirt that read "IÂ don't believe in your war, Mr. Bush!" during a performance on Good Morning America and posting an open letter explaining her opposition on her website. At a performance with Kid Rock at the 45th annual Grammy Awards, she wore a large peace sign and a guitar strap with the words "No War." Crow appeared in the "New Faces" section of Rolling Stone in 1994. Tuesday Night Music Club featured many of the songs written by Crow's friends, including the second single, "Leaving Las Vegas". The album was slow to garner attention, until "All I Wanna Do" became an unexpected smash hit in the fall of 1994. As she later stated in People, she found an old poetry book in a used book store in the L.A. area and used a poem as lyrics in the song.
