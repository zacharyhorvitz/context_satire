In the 1600s the court of Cosmo Medici gather to watch a play. The town of MÃ¢con is plagued with a curse that has made every woman barren and brought famine to the land. A woman is in labour signifying the first birth in many years which the midwives initially believe is a false labour due to The Mother's advanced years and general ugliness. However she does give birth to a healthy baby boy. During Season 9, he is back to his old self, sleeping with many of the mothers of the PTA and secretly stealing from them to pawn their belongings. After an STD outbreak sweeps through the PTA, Frank is revealed to be the source. Because of this, his son Liam is expelled from private school and forced to attend public school. Frank also nominates former congressman Mo White during a congressional election as a part of a scam to earn money, though he comes to have second thoughts after the man is revealed to be a sex-offender. The Bishop orders her executed, however the laws of the town expressly forbid the execution of a virgin. To circumvent this Medici makes a suggestion to The Bishop that The Daughter be raped. The Bishop dispenses holy pardons to members of The Militia allowing them to rape The Daughter. The scene is to take place in a curtained off canopy bed behind which the actress playing The Daughter acts out screams.
