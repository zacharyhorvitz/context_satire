Dorothy Shaver became a full-time employee at Lord & Taylor in 1924, eventually becoming its president in 1945. Under her tenure, the Lord & Taylor Building was expanded to include several specialty and clothing departments, and Lord & Taylor became the first store to include such divisions. The fourth floor was rehabilitated to accommodate an older women's clothing department, and reopened in March 1938. That September, the renovated third floor opened to the public with divisions for dresses, millinery, and suits and coats. In May 2018 it was announced that Walmart would begin carrying Lord & Taylor products on their website. A few weeks later, HBC announced they would be closing up to ten Lord & Taylor stores, including the 5th Avenue location, amid declining store sales. The New York flagship store closed on January 2, 2019. Le Tote opened its first physical location, inside a Lord & Taylor store in the Ridge Hill Mall in Yonkers, NY, in October 2019. It is referred to as a Rental Studio and customers can view a selection of inventory and sign up for the service there.
