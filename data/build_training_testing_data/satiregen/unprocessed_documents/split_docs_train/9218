 The Louisiana flooding has hit Jo Lee Misner's family hard: Her mother's house, Uncle Donald's old shop and Uncle Gary's place, they're all under water. Misner has 36 relatives on her mom's side who have lost their houses -- that's 13 homes -- in the small community of Colyell in Livingston Parish. Many of them live on the same street where she grew up. Her husband has four relatives who have lost homes in nearby Baker, Baton Rouge and Denham Springs.  Toya Graham first made headlines after a televised smackdown of her teenage son during the Baltimore riots last year. More than a year later, she's in the spotlight again --  but for a more somber reason. The single mother of six was left homeless after the same son, Michael Singleton, started an accidental fire that displaced the family Saturday. Singleton, 17, was frying chicken tenders and had stepped away to use the bathroom when the fire broke out, he told CNN affiliate WBFF. Some time later, Patricia is driving a motor home through the desert. She pulls over and goes to the back to check on Madeline and Grace. She asserts that medical tests have confirmed Grace is as healthy as she looks, and as long as Madeline keeps eating the proper diet, they can continue feeding and raising Grace. Madeline is concerned about something else, however: Grace has begun teething.
