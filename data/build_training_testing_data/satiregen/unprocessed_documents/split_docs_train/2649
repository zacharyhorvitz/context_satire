Tailgate Clothing Company, Corp. is a private clothing company with design offices in New York City, NY and distribution in Ankeny, IA. The company was established in 1997 by Todd Snyder and Steve King as a multi-tier lifestyle clothing company that appeals to the 18- to 30-year-old male and female consumer and is sold in retailers in the USA and Japan. The company designs and manufactures its products for sale in specialty boutiques like Fred Segal, Scoop, American Rag, and E Street Denim. Their products are also sold in larger retailers like Saks and Barneys. The J.Crew Group, an American clothing and accessories retailer based in New York City, was founded in 1983 with the launch of its catalog and expanded into brick-and-mortar retailing in 1989 with its first store at the South Street Seaport in New York City. J. Crew hired Drexler as Chairman and CEO in 2003 after his abrupt departure from Gap. Applying similar strategies from Gap, Drexler sought to reposition the J. In March 1989, the first J.Crew retail outlet opened in the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, and the company planned to open 45 more stores. Five months after the opening of its first store, J.Crew added two new catalog lines: "Classics" and "Collections." "Collections" used more complicated designs and finer fabrics to create dressier and more expensive items, while "Classics" featured clothes that could be worn both to work and for leisure activities. In the fall of 1989, J.Crew opened three new stores in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; and Costa Mesa, California, all locations with strong catalog sales.
