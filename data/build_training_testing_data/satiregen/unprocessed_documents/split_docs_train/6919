 Model and reality TV personality Janice Dickinson has been subpoenaed to testify at the upcoming retrial of Bill Cosby as one of as many as five "prior bad acts" witnesses, according to a source close to the case. Dickinson said in a November 2014 interview that Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1982 after the two had dinner in Lake Tahoe. She alleged that he gave her a pill and a glass of red wine shortly before she passed out. Cosby attorney Martin Singer at the time called the accusation "a fabricated lie."  Less than a year after his trial ended in a hung jury, Bill Cosby will again stand trial on three counts of aggravated indecent assault. This time, though, the proceedings will unfold in a markedly different courtroom -- and a different world. As before, the state criminal case centers on Cosby's word against that of Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who alleges Cosby drugged her, then assaulted her in January 2004 at his home near Philadelphia. Cosby, whose reputation has collapsed since his '80s sitcom redefined mainstream depictions of African-American families on TV, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.  The judge overseeing Bill Cosby's retrial said his wife's career as a social worker in sexual assault cases had no bearing on his decisions in the case in an emotional court hearing Thursday. Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, Court Judge Steven T. O'Neill at times choked up and lost his words in speaking about his wife, part of his ruling not to recuse himself. "It's difficult to have her accomplishments trivialized in a partisan motion," he said in the hearing. "It's a difficult thing when parties include to bring the families of a jurist" into a proceeding, he added.
