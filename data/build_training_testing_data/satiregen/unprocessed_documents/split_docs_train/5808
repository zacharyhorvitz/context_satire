The term 'Brown Bailout' refers to the provision that UPS has lobbied to have put into the $34.5 billion Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act (H.R. 915) voted on by the United States House of Representatives in May 2009 and by the United States Senate in March 2010. The term was coined in FedEx's large online advertising campaign against UPS and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; it seeks to emphasize the idea that changing FedEx's personnel statute would be equivalent to giving UPS a 'bailout'. However, independent observers have strongly criticized FedEx's wording, claiming that it was "an abuse of the term". In 1967, a new U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) combined major federal responsibilities for air and surface transport. The Federal Aviation Agency's name changed to the Federal Aviation Administration as it became one of several agencies (e.g., Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, the Coast Guard, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway Commission) within DOT (albeit the largest). The FAA administrator would no longer report directly to the president but would instead report to the Secretary of Transportation. New programs and budget requests would have to be approved by DOT, which would then include these requests in the overall budget and submit it to the president. As a result of the March 10, 2019 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash and the Lion Air Flight 610 crash five months earlier, most airlines and countries began grounding the Boeing 737 MAX 8 (and in many cases all MAX variants) due to safety concerns, but the FAA declined to temporarily ground Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft operating in the U.S. On March 12, the FAA said that its ongoing review showed "no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft." Some U.S. Senators called for the FAA to ground the aircraft until an investigation into the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash was complete. U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said that "If the FAA identifies an issue that affects safety, the department will take immediate and appropriate action."
