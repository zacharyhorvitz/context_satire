In 1937, the National Study Committee recommended the formation of new organization, which was later called Canadian Cancer Society for the control of cancer. The Canadian Cancer Society is a national, community-based organization of volunteers whose mission is the eradication of cancer and the enhancement of the quality of life of people who have cancer. The Canadian Cancer Society is Canada's largest national cancer charity and the country's largest national charitable funder of cancer research. This led to the first daffodil days in the spring of 1957, when Society volunteers in Toronto raised over $1,200 on sales of daffodils. As the first flower of spring, the daffodil became a symbol of hope in the fight against cancer and daffodil days fundraising events spread throughout the rest of Canada and amongst cancer organizations around the world, including the American Cancer Society, the Irish Cancer Society and The Cancer Council Australia.
