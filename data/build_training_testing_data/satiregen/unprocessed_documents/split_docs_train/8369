In April 2016, Haas, at 38, had toe surgery and was out for nine months, "I know that there's a chance that I might not come back from this," Haas said. "I know it will be a very, very hard task, but there's no doubt in my mind I'm certainly going to try." Haas was known for his refined footwork and racquet skills, both of which he used to construct quick defensive-to-offensive transitions. He was widely considered as one of the best players to have never won a grand slam, having been restricted by numerous injuries. Reviewers described him as having nice "fluidity" and how his game overall allows him to adapt to most situations, as demonstrated by his equal win percentage over both right and left-handed players, as well as his relatively even win percentages on all surfaces. Haas' mental game was described as solid, boasting a positive win record in deciding sets (3rd or 5th). Haas is also known for his early collaborations with Michael Joncas and Marty Haugen, and for many years the three of them were an important influence on liturgical music in the English-speaking world. They traveled together throughout the United States and beyond for many years, presenting concerts and workshops. They remain friends to this day. Haas presently continues traveling as a speaker, workshop leader, and concert performer alone, and often with his friend and colleague, Lori True (whose music is also published by GIA).
