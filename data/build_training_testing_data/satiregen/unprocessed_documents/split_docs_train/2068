 In the first half of 2015, passenger complaints rose 20% despite better overall performance by airlines, the federal government said Tuesday. Gripes about the cost of flying surged. The number of fliers angered about airfares nearly tripled -- from less than 300 in the first six months of last year to 870 so far this year, according to data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The largest number of complaints were the usual annoyances of delays and cancellations. The Inspector General is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation and assists Congress, the Secretary of Transportation, and senior department officials in achieving a safe, efficient, and effective transportation system that meets the national interests and enhances the quality of life. The earliest predecessor of Caltrans was the Bureau of Highways, which was created by the California Legislature and signed into law by Governor James Budd in 1895. This agency consisted of three commissioners who were charged with analyzing the state road system and making recommendations. At the time, there was no state highway system, since roads were purely a local responsibility. California's roads consisted of crude dirt roads maintained by county governments, as well as some paved roads within city boundaries, and this ad hoc system was no longer adequate for the needs of the state's rapidly growing population.
