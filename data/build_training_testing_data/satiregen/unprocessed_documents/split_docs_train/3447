The third season received mixed reviews from critics. Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker gave the season a positive review, saying "It seemed doubtful that the showâ€™s creators could keep those plates spinning for another round, but the third season introduces a fantastic new contrivance: a psychotic new network head, played by Chris Diamantopoulos." Brian Lowry of Variety gave the season a lukewarm review, praising Matt LeBlanc's performance, writing: "Episodes remains distinguished, mostly, by Matt LeBlanc's gameness in playing a jaundiced, utterly self-absorbed version of himself, the classic stereotype of a sitcom star with an oversized ego.". Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Episodes is an American-British television comedy series created by David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik and produced by Hat Trick Productions. It premiered on Showtime in the United States on January 9, 2011 and on BBC Two in the United Kingdom on January 10, 2011. The show is about a British husband-and-wife comedy writing team who travel to Hollywood to remake their successful British TV series, with unexpected results. It stars Matt LeBlanc portraying a satirical version of himself. The twenty-sixth series of Top Gear aired in early 2019 on BBC Two and BBC Two HD. It was the third presented by Matt LeBlanc, Chris Harris and Rory Reid, with Sabine Schmitz making an appearance as a co-presenter in the series. This was the final series presented by LeBlanc, whose departure was primarily down to the star having to spend too much time away from his family; and Reid, who was demoted from the main show but was at the time announced as continuing to present Extra Gear, which ultimately did not return. Reid would instead present Speed Freaks on ITV4.
