Willy is an 11-year-old boy who believes weird creatures are lurking, just waiting to attack him. He believes that the only thing keeping him safe is his house. When his parents decide to move, Willy isn't thrilled with the idea of going to a new school and living in a strange home. One day, Gooby, a teddy bear that Willy had as a little boy, arrives at the new home.  President Donald Trump told top Democrats on Tuesday that Mexico would be paying for his southern border wall, thanks to his recently signed United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement, according to a recounting of the meeting by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The claim resurrects a popular theme from his 2016 campaign that has yet to materialize in substance -- Mexican leadership has long denied it would pay for a wall. A Mexican official familiar with the issue told CNN on Tuesday, "MexicoÂ´s position regarding the so-called wall is the same the previous government had. Mexico WILL NOT pay for it, no matter how you spin it." Meanwhile, Despereaux returns to his family home, only to be punished by the mouse council again by learning to be afraid by the threadmaster, Hovis. As a result, he gets lost in a cave, and is thought by the mice to be dead. He then discovers that the princess is in danger; he tries to tell the king but he is too despondent to listen. Despereaux tries to get help elsewhere; he tries to tell his people to help, but they are afraid by his presence (thinking that he is a ghost).
