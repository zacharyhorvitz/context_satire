 (CNN) -- The NCAA says it will examine Penn State's "institutional control" of its athletics department and how it has handled the child sex abuse scandal that has tainted top university officials. "The recount of these tragic events in the grand jury report is deeply troubling," the group's president, Mark Emmert, said in a letter to the university. "If true, individuals who were in a position to monitor and act upon learning of potential abuses appear to have been acting starkly contrary to the values of higher education, as well as the NCAA." "While the criminal justice process clearly takes precedence over any NCAA actions, the association is closely monitoring the situation," the NCAA said. Penn State has a large football following and attracts tens of thousands of visitors to its campus; the surrounding area is known as "Happy Valley" for tailgating and games on autumn Saturdays in Beaver Stadium. The largest crowd ever at Beaver Stadium was on October 21, 2017, as 110,823 people watched the Nittany Lions defeat the University of Michigan by a score of 42-13. The school has earned a reputation as "Linebacker U" for the number of high-quality linebackers trained. Joe Paterno was the head coach for the Nittany Lion football team from 1966 until he was fired on November 9, 2011, in the aftermath of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal.  Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach accused of sexually abusing boys over a 14-year period, is working with a private investigator in his quest to prove his innocence, his lawyer said Monday. Attorney Joe Amendola said his client, who is free on $100,000 bail, is conducting his own investigation. Besides the original attorney general's criminal inquiry, several other investigations have been launched tied to various aspects of Sandusky's case, including by Penn State and the U.S. Department of Education. Sandusky, 67, is charged with 40 counts related to the alleged sexual abuse of eight young boys.
