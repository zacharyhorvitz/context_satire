Premises are land and buildings together considered as a property. This usage arose from property owners finding the word in their title deeds, where it originally correctly meant "the aforementioned; what this document is about", from Latin prae-missus = "placed before".In this sense, the word is always used in the plural, but singular in construction. Note that a single house or a single other piece of property is "premises", not a "premise", although the word "premises" is plural in form; e.g. "The equipment is on the customer's premises", never "The equipment is on the customer's premise". The Indiana State Fair is an annual fair held in Indianapolis, Indiana, usually in August. The first fair was held in October 1852, on the grounds of what became known as Military Park. The first Indiana State Fair on its present site along East 38th Street was held in 1892The state fair buildings and grounds are used for a variety of other shows when the fair is not being held. The largest building at the fairgrounds is the Indiana Farmers Coliseum.
