L'Oreal announced in May 2015 that it was partnering with bioprinting startup Organovo to figure out how to 3D print living, breathing derma that can be used to test products for toxicity and efficacy. "We're the first beauty company that Organovo has worked with," said Guive Balooch, global vice president of L'Oreal's tech incubator. Color&Co was founded independently in 2017 by a collective of colorists and tech engineers from L’Oreal Research and Innovation. It was developed within L’Oréal’s Technology Incubator. Color&Co launched online in May 2019. Consumers complete a questionnaire to select their hair color or consult with an independent colorist via real-time video chat. Since taking office, Agon has shaped a new philosophy of global marketing with his doctrine of universalization: beauty for all. Another focus is on expanding into developing countries, with the goal of winning one billion new customers by 2020. In addition to his vision for L’Oreal, Jean-Paul Agon also has strong viewpoints on corporate social responsibility; often being quoted as stating “the leader in beauty must be exemplary in terms of the environment.”  To this end, L’Oreal has made the commitment to halve their CO2 emissions, water consumption and waste production within the next 10 years. Jean-Paul Agon has stated that corporate social responsibility issues are as important as business profitability and this is shown with the announcement of the group wide sustainability plan that was announced in 2013.
