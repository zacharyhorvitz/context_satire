Jimmy regains his outgoing demeanor after Howard shoulders blame for Chuck's death. Jimmy manages a cell phone store but makes more reselling prepaid phones. His reinstatement request is denied over lack of remorse for Chuck. After faking mourning, he successfully appeals, but reveals he's going to practice as Saul Goodman. The death of Jimmy's brother Chuck serves as a catalyst for his further transformation into Saul Goodman, and Jimmy's entrance into the criminal world puts a strain on his relationship with Kim and his future as a lawyer. Chuck's death also deeply affects Kim and Howard. Mike becomes a contracted security consultant for Madrigal. Nacho's attempted murder of Hector Salamanca causes Hector's stroke and disability, and affects the operations of Don Eladio's drug cartel and Gus Fring's plot to take it over. The series also provides brief glimpses of Saul's fate after the events of "Granite State", the penultimate episode of Breaking Bad, in which Saul fears for his own safety and takes on a new identity in Omaha, Nebraska as Gene Takavic, the manager of a Cinnabon store. In Better Call Saul flash-forwards, "Gene"  reminisces about his past, but remains paranoid that someone might discover his true identity.
