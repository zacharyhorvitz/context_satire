 In 1988, extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane and his political party were banned from Israel's parliament for being racist and undemocratic. Now his followers are making a comeback, courted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he seeks a fifth term as the country's leader. On Tuesday night, Netanyahu tweeted directly at two right-wing parties and the extreme right Jewish Strength party. "The head of the Jewish Home, the National Union, and Jewish Strength -- if you don't unite, you won't pass the electoral threshold, the right-wing bloc will lose and Gantz will form a left-wing government with the support of the Arab parties," he wrote. With the fall of the Barak government in late 2000, Netanyahu expressed his desire to return to politics. By law, Barak's resignation was supposed to lead to elections for the prime minister position only. Netanyahu insisted that general elections should be held, claiming that otherwise it would be impossible to have a stable government. Netanyahu decided eventually not to run for the prime minister position, a move which facilitated the surprising rise to power of Ariel Sharon, who at the time was considered less popular than Netanyahu. Prior to the April 2019 Israeli legislative election, Netanyahu helped broker a deal that united the Jewish Home party with the far-right Otzma Yehudit party, in order to form the Union of the Right-Wing Parties. The motivation of the deal was to overcome the electoral threshold for smaller parties. The deal was criticized in the media, as Otzma is widely characterized as racist and traces its origins to the extremist Kahanist movement.
