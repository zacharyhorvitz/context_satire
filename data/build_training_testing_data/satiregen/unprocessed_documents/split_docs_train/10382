 Disgust is our guardian: Though most of us would rather not feel this unpleasant emotion, it helps us avoid disease and infection, new research suggests. Long before microscopes revealed unseen germs and parasites, humans developed a system of disgust, with six basic triggers warning us to turn away from harmful pathogens, according to a study published Sunday in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. "Disgust evolved to protect us from disease in our ancient past. The disgust response today may, or may not, be a good guide to what might make us sick today," said Val Curtis, lead author of the study and a professor and director of the Environmental Health Group of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.  The following contains spoilers about "The Americans" series finale. "The Americans" resisted any temptation to do a "cute" finale, to somehow link this Cold War-era drama to the Russian controversies of today.

The FX series has always seemed to come with a natural expiration date.  Millennials aren't using their vacation days. Combined, they command more than $1.3 trillion in annual spending. And FOMO -- fear of missing out -- pushes them toward experiences over material things. So why not put all that time and money toward a vacation in space?
