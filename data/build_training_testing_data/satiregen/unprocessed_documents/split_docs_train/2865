At the September 26 MSNBC debate, Biden explained how he would allow for Social security to last. He said that in the 1980s he had a meeting with prominent members of Congress and the solution they came up with was the raise the cap level, he stated that now the same solution would apply and that unity between the two parties was also necessary, "It was Joe Biden, Pat Moynihan, Bob Dole ...  George Mitchell when we made that deal . I'll never forget Bob Dole turning to Pat Moynihan and saying, 'we all got to jump in this boat at the same time.' So the bottom line here is, you can't do it by growing the economy alone. On January 31, 2007, Biden took his first steps into the presidential campaign, but his comments about other candidates overshadowed his entrance. Biden especially drew criticism in the popular press for his evaluation of Senator Barack Obama; Biden was quoted in the New York Observer as saying: "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." The audio of the interview, posted on the Observer's website, reportedly includes a significant pause after "African-American" which would drastically change the meaning of the statement. In 2018, Biden said he was "a gaffe machine" but disagreed with comparisons to Trump, saying his gaffe-prone nature was "a wonderful thing compared to a guy who can't tell the truth". On 26 August Biden subtly addressed the controversy. Following a minor mishap in which he stumbled over where he had spoken earlier that day at Dartmouth College, he looked directly at the assembled press and said, "I want to be clear: I'm not going nuts." In 2013, he said the doctor who repaired his two brain aneurysms in 1988 had told him that, if he survived the operation, "the side of the brain that the first aneurysm is on controls your ability to speak".
