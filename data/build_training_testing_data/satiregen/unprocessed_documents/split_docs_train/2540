 British Prime Minister Theresa May has told Conservatives lawmakers she will not fight the next general election in 2022, a member of parliament attending the meeting told CNN. The pledge came as May was making her final pitch to Conservative Members of Parliament on Wednesday evening before they started voting in a secret ballot which began at 6 p.m. (1 p.m. ET). The Prime Minister "got a real grilling, but overall solid support" as she made her case to Conservative lawmakers, a separate pro-May MP told CNN. On 10 December 2018, the Prime Minister postponed the vote in the House of Commons on her Brexit deal. The announcement came minutes after the Prime Minister's Office confirmed the vote would be going ahead. Faced with the prospect of a defeat in the House of Commons, this option gave May more time to negotiate with Conservative backbenchers and the EU, even though they had ruled out further discussions. The decision was met with calls from many Welsh Labour MPs for a motion of no confidence in the Government.  UK Prime Minister Theresa May survived a vote of no-confidence triggered by members of her own party over her handling of Britain's departure from the European Union, but her margin of victory was significantly narrower than her supporters expected. May won by 200 votes to 117, meaning that a third of her parliamentary party failed to back her. The size of the rebellion underscored the daunting task faced by the Prime Minister if she is to secure approval in a divided House of Commons for her imperiled Brexit deal. Outside Downing Street, May admitted that it had been a "long and challenging day."
