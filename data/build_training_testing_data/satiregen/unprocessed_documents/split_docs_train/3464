Aside from being the “first” next-gen console, as well as providing many, many people with their first DVD player, the PlayStation 2 launched in something of a Golden Age of the non-PC gaming industry. Gaming tech was becoming extremely sophisticated ... Sony seemingly knew the exact route toward popularity, turning the console with the least powerful hardware of that generation into a juggernaut of success. The PlayStation 4 (PS4) is the latest video game console from Sony Computer Entertainment announced at a press conference on February 20, 2013. In the meeting, Sony revealed some hardware specifications of the new console. The eighth-generation system, launched in the fourth quarter of 2013, introduced the x86 architecture to the PlayStation series. According to lead system architect, Mark Cerny, development on the PlayStation 4 began as early as 2008. The PlayStation 5 will feature a completely revamped user interface. The PlayStation 5 is set to be backwards-compatible with PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games, with Cerny stating that the transition to the new console is meant to be a soft one. However, in later interviews Sony was unwilling to commit to backward-compatibility. At CES 2020, Sony unveiled the official logo for the platform.
