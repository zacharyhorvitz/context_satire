On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois. The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic "House Divided" speech in 1858. Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system, in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.  Pope Francis has made clear that "wealth and income inequality is a moral issue" that needs addressing as a priority. Expect President Barack Obama to address that theme strongly during his State of the Union address Tuesday -- but for very different political reasons. Barack Obama will make economic inequality central to his 2014 agenda in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night. The president's speech will be watched intensely not just in the United States, but right across the world. The first inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States took place on Tuesday, January 20, 2009. The inauguration, which set a record attendance for any event held in Washington, D.C., marked the commencement of the first term of Barack Obama as President and Joe Biden as Vice President. Based on combined attendance numbers, television viewership, and Internet traffic, it was one of the most-observed events ever by the global audience.
