 The New Yorker rescinded its invitation to Steve Bannon to headline its annual festival after a swift backlash from big-name participants who said they would not attend if Bannon remained on the schedule. There was also fierce resistance from within the ranks of the magazine. Numerous staffers felt that having Bannon on stage would be inappropriate. Bannon responded to the uproar by criticizing the magazine and the "howling online job."  Since leaving the White House last year, it's clear that Steve Bannon had hoped to both make it back into the headlines in the US and appear even more influential in the eyes of Europeans. The New Yorker magazine has just granted him his wish. The magazine's invitation to President Donald Trump's former chief strategist and campaign CEO as the featured guest at its upcoming festival ignited such a firestorm of criticism that Editor David Remnick decided to cancel it within hours of the announcement. The entire cycle, from invitation, to controversy, to the invitation being withdrawn, amounted to a big victory for Bannon -- a man who was looking very much like a has-been in America, but who likes to think of himself as a genius of historic magnitude on the global stage.  Steve Bannon may have been shunned from one high-profile media confab, but he is still set to appear at another. A day after the New Yorker rescinded its invitation for Bannon to attend its annual festival, The Economist's editor-in-chief Zanny Minton Beddoes said her publication will still host the former White House strategist at its own event later this month. "The future of open societies will not be secured by like-minded people speaking to each other in an echo chamber, but by subjecting ideas and individuals from all sides to rigorous questioning and debate. This will expose bigotry and prejudice, just as it will reaffirm and refresh liberalism," Beddoes said in a statement published Tuesday.
