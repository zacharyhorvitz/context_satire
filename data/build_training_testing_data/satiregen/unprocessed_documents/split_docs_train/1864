The purpose of this film is to be able to show the side of every person involved in a medical situation, such as in the ICU. In this film, the doctors were interviewed, along with the family members of the patient, and the pain and stress the patient was enduring was obvious. It brings to question certain standards the public has, every person involved has a role and responsibility to ensure the best care of the patient. For example, in Selena's case, her daughter still had hope that her mother would come back to her, but the doctors have enough experience and have been through similar cases to know the reality. Dr. Jessica Zitter graduated from Harvard and is an attending physician at Highland Hospital. Aside from working at the hospital, she has published many articles as well as her own book. Her work is focused on end of life care and how to improve it. She believes that all medical staff at the hospital has to work together to improve patient decision making and that if families and the medical community understood the ICU as doctors see it, then the conversations between doctors and families in the ICU could improve as well.
