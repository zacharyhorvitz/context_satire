The Goodwin Games is an American sitcom series that aired as a midseason replacement on Fox from May 20 to July 1, 2013. It was created and written by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas (creators of How I Met Your Mother) alongside Chris Harris. The 1999 season was to be one of disappointment, however, as Goodwin's performances mirrored that of his club. Despite featuring in 19 of Adelaide's 22 games, Goodwin's progress was marred by inconsistency as Adelaide finished a lowly 13th in what was, at the time, the club's worst ever finish to a season. On 13 May 2014 Goodwin signed a new two-year contract with the club, taking on a player-coach role to assist newly appointed St Mirren manager Tommy Craig. After Tommy Craig left Saints in December 2014, it was confirmed that Goodwin would return to playing duties only. The midfielder had taken on a player-coach role in the summer, but it is thought that ill-discipline while playing had cost him this role.
