The federal government has fallen victim to cyber attacks numerous times, especially in recent years. A 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office that included a survey of two dozen federal agencies found that cyberattacks exploded in frequency by 1,300 percent over the course of a decade, with 5,500 in 2006 to as many as 77,000 in 2015. The report listed eighteen of the agencies as operators of "high-impact systems", meaning that leaks could cause "catastrophic harm" to particular individuals, the government, or the general public. Board Leadership: The board of a company can decide to lower executive compensation by a given percentage, and give the percentage of compensation to a specific cause. This is an effort which can only be implemented from the top, as it will affect the compensation of all executives in the company. In Alcoa, an aluminum company based in the US, “1/5th of executive cash compensation is tied to safety, diversity, and environmental stewardship, which includes greenhouse gas emission reductions and energy efficiency” (Best Practices). This is not usually the case for most companies, where we see the board take a uniform step towards the environment, social, and governance issues. For music, the requirements are referred to as the "MAPL system". Following an extensive public hearing process organized by the CRTC, the MAPL system, created by Stan Klees (co-creator of the Juno Award), was adopted in 1971 to define and identify Canadian content in pieces of music for the purposes of increasing exposure of Canadian music on Canadian radio through content regulations governing a percentage (25%) of airplay to be devoted to Canadian music. The percentage was increased to 30% in the 1980s, and to 35% effective January 3, 1999. However, most new commercial radio stations licensed since 1999 have been licensed at 40%.
