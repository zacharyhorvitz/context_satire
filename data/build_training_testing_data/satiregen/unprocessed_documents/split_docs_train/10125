TV Guide wrote, "The third screen version of Fred Duprez's play proves once and for all there's no hope of reviving the dead...Overplayed without shame, but that doesn't help the ancient jokes any." Sky Movies noted a "broad comedy, with Ronald Shiner and Ted Ray extracting the maximum number of laughs out of the mother-in-law-coming-to-stay situation. Fabia Drake gives a sharply-observed portrait of the old battleaxe." In April 2004, at the request of the Animals, who were about to do their 40th anniversary tour, Hawkes was asked to form a band to tour with the Animals. This he did, bringing together a supergroup including Mick Avory (ex-the Kinks), Eric Haydock (ex-the Hollies), who teamed up to perform as the Class of '64, also featuring guitarists, Telecaster Ted Tomlin and Graham Pollock. The band toured around the world and recorded an album of past band hits and a new single called "She's Not My Child". Shiner's career came to a close with one game for the 1974 New England Patriots. Once again, Shiner's role in 1974 was to be the backup to a prominent quarterback—this time Jim Plunkett. Shiner was sent into his only appearance in the 1974 regular season with the Patriots holding a 35–3 lead against the Baltimore Colts. After leading the Patriots on an 80-yard touchdown drive, Shiner took himself out of the game to give third-string quarterback Neil Graff a chance to play in Graff's first NFL regular-season contest.
