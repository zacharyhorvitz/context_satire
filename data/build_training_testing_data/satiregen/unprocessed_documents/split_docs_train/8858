Marcia attempts to escape but is caught by "Patricia" and separated from Casey. Casey befriends "Hedwig," another one of Kevin's personalities that is a 9-year-old boy, who reveals himself as the one to have taken control of "the light" from "Barry." Casey convinces "Hedwig" to let her out of her cell to see his bedroom, believing that there might be a means of escape through the window "Hedwig" has described in that room, but she finds that it is only a drawing of a window. She takes a walkie-talkie from Hedwig and uses it to call for help, but the man at the other end thinks it is a prank. Kevin, as "Dennis," locks the girls in a cell in his underground quarters. They recognize his DID, and Claire attempts to use this to escape but is caught and separated from the others. Kevin continues going to work and attending appointments with Fletcher. Fletcher soon recognizes "Dennis" has displaced "Barry" as the dominant personality. In the meantime, Raylan is dealing with personal dilemmas, including working in the same building as his ex-wife (Natalie Zea), for whom he still has feelings. His continuing visits to Harlan are peppered with small crimes and big shootings, and his success in dealing with these matters draws Bo's attention. Bo promises the niece and nephew of Gio Reyes, head of a Miami drug cartel, that he will deliver Raylan to them in exchange for a large shipment of drugs. Boyd catches word of this and, with his "flock" of reformed prisoners, blows up the truck carrying the shipment, leading the niece and nephew to hold Bo accountable for the damages.
