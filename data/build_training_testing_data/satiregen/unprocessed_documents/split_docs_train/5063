In 2015, Krach successfully caught a thief who had taken his iPhone from his hands. As he chased the thief, he was spotted by police officers, who eventually apprehended the thief. Upon confirming Krach's identity, they provided him with a “legal loophole,” which enabled him to recover his phone sooner, rather than having it impounded as evidence. Krach claimed the officers had recently used DocuSign and shared their positive experiences with him. Under Bruner's sponsorship, Olson explored young children’s mental representations of space, particularly   how children's language influenced their ability to reconstruct spatial patterns. He found that while children had no difficulty reconstructing horizontal and vertical patterns, they had great difficulties with diagonals before they went to school. It seems that  to succeed in conceptualizing a diagonal, it has to be reconceived in terms of relations between horizontal and vertical axes. This research led to his first book, Spatial Cognition: The Child's Acquisition of Diagonality. In March 2016, SpringCM announced the opening of its new office in San Francisco, California, in order to meet the demands of the rapidly growing business and its goal to grow globally. This move allowed the company to be closer to its partners and customers, including the headquarters of Salesforce and DocuSign.
