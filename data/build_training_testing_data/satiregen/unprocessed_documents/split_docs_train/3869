 Pope Francis announced Monday the institution of a World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation, to be celebrated every year, beginning this September 1. "As Christians," the Pope said in a letter the Vatican published Monday, "we wish to contribute to resolving the ecological crisis which humanity is presently experiencing. In doing so, we must first rediscover in our own rich spiritual patrimony the deepest motivations for our concern for the care of creation." September 1 has been chosen to coincide with the same day of prayer already celebrated in the Christian Orthodox Church.  You can't call it "the dark side of the moon" based on a new NASA picture. A camera on the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite shot an arresting view of the moon crossing in front of the Earth. The image clearly shows the moon's far side lit up by the sun -- though even in full sunlight, the Earth is far brighter. "It is surprising how much brighter Earth is than the moon," DSCOVR project scientist Adam Szabo said in a news release. Besides expansion of the university, Georgetown also aimed to expand its resources and student body. The School of Nursing has admitted female students since its founding, and most of the university classes were made available to them on a limited basis by 1952. With the College of Arts and Sciences welcoming its first female students in the 1969â€“1970 academic year, Georgetown became fully coeducational.
