 Rand Paul said Thursday that the Republican Party and FOX News are trying to "pre-decide" who the Republican nominee will be. "People have to realize that what the media is doing here is pre-deciding an election," he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day." Fox Business announced last month that its January 14 debate would include the top six candidates based on the average of the five most recent national polls, as well as those who finish in the top five in Iowa or New Hampshire. Paul failed to meet that criteria.  Rand Paul will boycott Thursday night's Republican primary debate in South Carolina after being relegated from the main stage, he said on Monday. "I won't participate in anything that's not first tier because we have a first tier campaign," the Kentucky senator told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Paul's announcement came moments before Fox Business Network, the sponsor of Thursday's debate, announced that just seven candidates had qualified for the main stage. Those candidates are Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and John Kasich.  Skipping Thursday's debate may have been Rand Paul's savviest political move yet. The Kentucky senator's decision to boycott the sixth Republican showdown after being relegated to the earlier undercard round has resulted in far more airtime and significantly larger audiences than Paul could possibly have hoped for at the Fox Business Network debate. Instead of flying to South Carolina for debate prep, Paul has been on a two-day media tour in New York City, after which he will head to New Hampshire and Iowa. In the last 48 hours, he has done interviews with "The Dr. Oz Show," Comedy Central's "The Daily Show," and Fox News, as well as multiple interviews with CNN and MSNBC, that were all pegged to his decision to skip the debate.
