The Regiment of the Realm, the Shadow Hills High School marching band, first received global recognition after having participated at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 13 and April 20 alongside the group Big Gigantic. With 34 local marching band students, the Regiment of the Realm performed a remix of "Can't Hold Us" and "I Need A Dollar" with Big Gigantic and gained local fame for their performance at one of the biggest music festivals in the world. The school has moved locations over the years. It moved from Cave Creek, Arizona to rented units next to Cactus Shadows High School. It now will be using the closed Desert Arroyo Middle School, also rented from the Cave Creek Unified School District. Shadow Hills High School opened on August 31, 2009, with about 600 freshman and sophomore students. The high school is the fourth in the Desert Sands Unified School District.
