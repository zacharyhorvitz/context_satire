 A presidential debate in 2015 is only half the battle. The reaction on social media can also tell the tale of who did great and who flopped the debate. CNN's Republican presidential debate on Wednesday night was no different. Here are six of the biggest social media moments: Carly Fiorina takes on Donald Trump's remarks Carly Fiorina once again showed herself willing and able to go toe to toe with the leading candidates, taking Donald Trump to task for earlier comments he made about her.  Hillary Clinton's top aides said Wednesday night's Republican debate was a win for them, citing the GOP's virulent opposition to Planned Parenthood as a general-election vulnerability. "It did illuminate for the American people that we think this is a Republican Party that is really out of touch from where most Americans are, and shows that they don't have a lot of solutions for the problems that trouble people's lives," Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director, said after the debate. "And it is important for people to know that and that is a win." Clinton's team looked on as different Republican candidates jumped over each other to brandish their conservative bona fides on defunding the controversial women's health organization.  Donald Trump finally took some punches, Carly Fiorina grabbed control, Jeb Bush woke up and Marco Rubio and Chris Christie elbowed their way into the fray on a crowded stage. Everyone else just tried to crash the party. The CNN Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Wednesday crackled with confrontations between galloping insurgents and professional politicians desperate to channel the torrent of grass-roots fury that is consuming the campaign. Here are the top takeaways from a debate that could significantly reshuffle the GOP pack.
