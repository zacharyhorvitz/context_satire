Bamberger's policy did not prevent racial discrimination by Princeton. When African American mathematician William S. Claytor applied to the IAS in 1937, Princeton University said they "would not permit any colored person to go to the Institute for Advanced Study." It was not until 1939, when the institute had moved into its own building, that Veblen was able to offer Claytor a position; but this time Claytor turned it down on principle. The Center for Advanced Media Studies' core function is to promote both research in advanced media theory and the practice of traditional and new media to explore the dynamic relationship that media and humans share. Media study has advanced over the last century from a convergence of cultural studies, critical theories and philological disciplines focusing on the historical, linguistic and cultural analysis of how an idea is communicated. CAMS has been the host of conferences that include media theorists such as Tom Gunning and Thomas Elsaesser. Bernadette Wegenstein, a Research Professor and documentary film maker, is the director of CAMS. Neither the Princeton IAS nor SIAS is connected with, and should not be confused with, the Consortium of Institutes of Advanced Studies which comprises some twenty research institutes located throughout Great Britain and Ireland. The name Institute for Advanced Study, along with the acronym IAS, is also used by various other independent institutions throughout the world, some having little to do with the Princeton model.
