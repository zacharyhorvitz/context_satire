 Disillusioned and disappointed Palestinians took to the streets in the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem on Thursday following US President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Some were angry, others resigned, saying a peace process appeared all but impossible. Dozens gathered outside the Damascus Gate, in the eastern part of the city. "We are Jerusalemites, we belong to Jerusalem," they chanted.  As I watched Donald Trump announce that the United States would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move our embassy to that city, I could only think of one thing: my high school youth group Bible study. I know that sounds odd. Especially coming from a liberal Episcopalian like me. But there you have it.  Pope Francis called Wednesday for the preservation of Jerusalem's "identity" in the wake of President Donald Trump's expected move to declare the city the capital of Israel. "Jerusalem is a unique city, sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, and it has a special vocation to peace," the post's caption read, which depicts the Pope reciting a prayer on the city's Western Wall. "I pray to the Lord that such identity be preserved and strengthened for the benefit of the Holy Land, the Middle East and the entire world." Also on Wednesday, the leaders of Christian communities in Jerusalem told Trump in an open letter that recognizing the city as Israel's capital will "yield increased hatred, conflict, violence and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, moving us farther from the goal of unity and deeper toward destructive division."
