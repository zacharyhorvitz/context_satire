Bowie had reconnected with Brian Eno at his wedding to Iman Abdulmajid in 1992. Bowie and Eno each played pieces of their own music at the wedding reception and delighted at the "ebb and flow" of couples on the dance floor. At that point, Bowie knew "we were both interested in nibbling at the periphery of the mainstream rather than jumping in. We sent each other long manifestoes about what was missing in music and what we should be doing. Brian Eno instigated Robert Fripp's involvement. "I got a phone call when I was living in New York in July 1977," the guitarist recalled. "It was Brian Eno. He said that he and David were recording in Berlin and passed me over. Tony Visconti, who produced a number of Bowie's albums including the "Berlin trilogy" and Young Americans, wrote: "He always did what he wanted to do. And he wanted to do it his way and he wanted to do it the best way. His death was no different from his lifeâ€”a work of art. He made Blackstar for us, his parting gift.
