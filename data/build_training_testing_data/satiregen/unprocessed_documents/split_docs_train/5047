 Facebook is facing a crescendo of questions about how user data was harvested for political purposes, and for a second day investors dumped its stock over the risk the scandal poses to its business. Some U.S. lawmakers are calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify. British members of Parliament are summoning Zuckerberg too. Frustration is brewing within Facebook.  Bipartisan leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation committee have requested that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testify before their committees. The letter from the House Energy and Commerce Committee came from chairman Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, the committee's top Democrat Frank Pallone Jr., Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection subcommittee chairman Bob Latta, ranking Democrat Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, Communications and Technology subcommittee chairman Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and ranking member Mike Doyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat. "The Committee intends to hold a hearing in the near future," they wrote. "The hearing will examine the harvesting and sale of personal information from more than 50 million Facebook users, potentially without their notice or consent and in violation of Facebook policy."  After repeated calls for him to do so, Mark Zuckerberg has decided he will testify before Congress. Facebook sources tell CNNMoney the 33-year-old CEO has come to terms with the fact that he will have to testify before Congress within a matter of weeks, and Facebook is currently planning the strategy for his testimony. The pressure from lawmakers, the media and the public has become too intense to justify anything less. The Facebook sources believe Zuckerberg's willingness to testify will also put pressure on Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to do the same.
