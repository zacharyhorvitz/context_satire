The Steve Miller Band is an American rock band formed in 1966 in San Francisco, California. The band is led by Steve Miller on guitar and lead vocals. The group is best known for a string of (mainly) mid- to late-1970s hit singles that are staples of classic rock radio, as well as several earlier psychedelic rock albums. Miller left his first band to move to San Francisco and form the Steve Miller Blues Band. Miller followed up with Fly Like an Eagle in 1976, and Book of Dreams in 1977. (The songs for both had been recorded at the same time, and released over two single albums rather than one double-album.) This pair of albums represented the peak of Miller's commercial career, both reaching the top echelons of the album charts and spawning a lengthy series of hit singles, including "Fly Like an Eagle", "Rock'n Me", "Take the Money and Run", "Jet Airliner", and "Jungle Love". The Steve Miller Band co-headlined a major stadium tour with the Eagles in 1978. Originally called the Steve Miller Blues Band, the group first made its mark as a psychedelic blues rock band in San Francisco. They went through a fallow period commercially in the early seventies before coming back with the hit album The Joker and the song of the same name in late 1973, before releasing the band's two most successful studio albums in 1976 and 1977, Fly Like an Eagle and Book of Dreams. In 1978, they released their biggest selling album in North America, Greatest Hits 1974â€“78, which has been certified 13x multi-platinum in the United States and diamond in Canada. Although the 1981 release Circle of Love was less successful than the two preceding studio albums, the popularity of 1982's Abracadabra, which included the worldwide hit single of the same name, more than made up for it.
