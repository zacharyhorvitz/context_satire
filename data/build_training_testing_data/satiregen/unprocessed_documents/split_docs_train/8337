Rick Salutin, also of the Star, was less enthusiastic of the show's portrayal of minorities on television saying "only accents are funny in Kim's Convenience" and that audiences are "laughing at the characters not with them". Salutin concluded by stating "I don't see why supporting Canadian culture means you should be uncritical, as if someone will take it away if you weren't. You should be most critical about what you care most about like public education or the CBC, you want them to be good not just there". Although not directly a response to Salutin's review, actor Paul Sun-Hyung Lee (Appa) has questioned critics' inclination to cite accents as offensive: "They won’t say—but is it because you’re seeing Asians on the screen? Should parents pay for good grades? Pat KcKenna thinks it's the best way to get them to move out of the house... eventually. But Rebecca Kohler says, "If you don't like what your kid is doing, you don't offer a bonus, you remove a necessity." Then Pete Zedlacher and Tyler Morrison argue over whether Lake Superior is indeed the superior Great Lake. Big Daddy Tazz tries to cash in on his name and convince funny man Scott Faulconbridge that bringing your kid to work is an excellent idea. Next up, Cash Cab’s Adam Growe respectfully suggests that good manners should be much higher on Rebecca Kohler’s list of things to care about.
