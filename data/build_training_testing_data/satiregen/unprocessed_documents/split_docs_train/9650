Special Olympics is the world's largest sports organization for children and adults with intellectual disabilities and physical disabilities, providing year-round training and activities to 5 million participants and Unified Sports partners in 172 countries. Special Olympics competitions are held every day, all around the worldâ€”including local, national and regional competitions, adding up to more than 100,000 events a year. Like the International Paralympic Committee, the Special  Olympics organization is recognized by the International Olympic Committee; however, unlike the Paralympic Games, Special Olympics World Games are not held in the same year or in conjunction with the Olympic Games. The Special Olympics World Games is a major event put on by the Special Olympics.
