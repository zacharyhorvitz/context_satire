On May 11, 2011, Jeff Conaway was hospitalized for pneumonia, for which he was placed in an induced coma. He was later taken off life support, and died on May 27, 2011. He was the second Celebrity Rehab cast member to die in 2011, following the death of Mike Starr two months prior. Pinsky attributed Conaway's death to his addiction, stating, "What happens is, like with most opiate addicts, eventually they take a little too much...and they aspirate, so what's in their mouth gets into their lungs...That's what happened with Jeff." Billboard liked what they heard. "Covering other people's hits can be dangerous, but not for Mathis, who is in the right mood, tempo and vocal range this time around." Mathis had two of his biggest hits in 1962 and 1963, with "Gina" (#6) and "What Will Mary Say" (#9).
