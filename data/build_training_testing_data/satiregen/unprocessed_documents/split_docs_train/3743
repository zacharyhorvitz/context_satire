 On January 20th, our nation witnessed the peaceful transfer of power with the inauguration of a new president. The next morning, America awakened to a peaceful show of power from millions of women and men across the country, and indeed across the world, in the Women's March. Women and their families marched to show our values, our unity and our good spirit. Many marched for the rights and dignity of the men, women and children who have been targeted for discrimination by this administration -- and in recent days we've seen that open prejudice on full display in the President's immoral and unconstitutional ban on refugees and citizens from seven Muslim nations.  The co-founder of Patron tequila, which is produced in Mexico, is urging President Donald Trump and his administration to reconsider its threat to tax Mexican imports 20% to pay for a border wall, warning American consumers will ultimately be the ones paying for it. John Paul DeJoria, who is also the co-founder of the Paul Mitchell brand of hair products, told CNN's Erin Burnett Friday night "if it comes to effect, unfortunately with all due respect, the Mexican government doesn't pay for it, the US consumer does." "If the tax comes across, we have to raise our prices," he said, using his own tequila product as an example. "So it's passed on to our distributors, onto the retailer, which will pass it on to the consumer."  On Monday in federal court in New York, the bipartisan watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility in Government in Washington, or CREW, sued President Donald Trump for taking money from foreign governments through his business ventures. I am one of the lawyers on the suit. The lawsuit is a response to an extraordinary situation in which the President of the United States is benefiting from business relationships with foreign countries. Needless to say, those countries have a deeply vested interest in presidential decisions regarding trade and military policy.
