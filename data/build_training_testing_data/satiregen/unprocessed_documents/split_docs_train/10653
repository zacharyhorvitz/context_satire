In December 2011, Politifact gave the History Channel's claim that the United States Congress stayed open on Christmas Day for most of its first 67 years of existence a "pants on fire" rating, the lowest of its ratings, noting that its own research showed that both the Senate and the House had only convened once in those 67 years on a Christmas Day and adding that, since there's a one in seven chance of Christmas falling on a Sunday (when Congress did not meet in order to attend church), the claim that they would have convened almost every Christmas is "ridiculous". The claim had first been broadcast on the History Channel program Christmas Unwrapped â€“ The History of Christmas before being subsequently picked up by the American Civil Liberties Union's website on the "Origins of Christmas" and by the Comedy Central series The Daily Show. Daily Show host Jon Stewart responded the next day by stating it was their fault for trusting the History Channel and satirized a clip from the History Channel about UFOs and Nazis by stating, "The next thing you know we'll all find out the Nazis did not employ alien technology in their quest for world domination." Its initial programming library drew from A&E and History's program libraries. Much of its programming focuses on World War II; this same type of programming had earned The History Channel the appellation "The Hitler Channel" up until the transfer of these programs to Military History. Military History was launched on January 5, 2005 and as the third spin-off channel of History. Viewers of History wanted more military history programs, but there was not time on the channel, thus the creation of Military History. Beginning on March 27, 2004, a military-history programming block started on History International as a prologue. The launch was an open preview, or soft launch, as no cable operators were signed up.
