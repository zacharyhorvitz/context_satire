 Mitt Romney's high-profile trip to England, Israel and Poland featured cheering crowds, iconic settings and forceful speeches, but may be remembered more for diplomatic gaffes. Whether any of it will matter when American voters choose between Romney and President Barack Obama three months from now is less clear. The six-day trip to key U.S. allies that ended Tuesday was intended to burnish the foreign policy credentials of the former Massachusetts governor and help him galvanize support from the Republican Party's conservative base. However, an early stumble when Romney questioned London's readiness for the Olympics, followed by remarks in Israel that angered Palestinians, created a story line that persisted through the trip. Bronisław Maria Komorowski (Polish pronunciation:  (listen); born 4 June 1952) is a Polish politician and historian who served as President of Poland from 2010 to 2015. Komorowski served as Minister of Defence from 2000 to 2001. As Marshal of the Sejm (Speaker of the lower house of Parliament), Komorowski exercised the powers and duties of head of state following the death of President Lech Kaczyński in a plane crash on 10 April 2010. Komorowski was then the governing Civic Platform party's candidate in the resulting presidential election, which he won in the second round of voting on 4 July 2010. Despite not being the PiS candidate for either President or Prime Minister, Kaczyński is widely considered to have had a considerable influence on the PiS victories in both the 2015 presidential and 2015 parliamentary elections. Even though he does not serve as either prime minister or president, and is formally just a member of the Sejm, he is considered one of the most influential men in Poland, as well as an influential leader in the European Union.
