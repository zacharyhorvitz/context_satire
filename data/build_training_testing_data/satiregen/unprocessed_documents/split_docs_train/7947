Meanwhile, James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson started a family business called Johnson & Johnson. However, the firm was struggling to stay afloat, as it didn't have enough capital for a startup company. While the two brothers were going at it alone, Seabury was unable to pay RWJ the monthly payments that had been agreed upon when Johnson left the partnership. Seabury agreed to let Johnson re-enter the medical industry if Seabury could cease making the monthly payments. Kennedy, however, made efforts to keep Johnson busy, informed, and at the White House often, telling aides, "I can't afford to have my vice president, who knows every reporter in Washington, going around saying we're all screwed up, so we're going to keep him happy." Kennedy appointed him to jobs such as head of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunities, through which he worked with African Americans and other minorities. Kennedy may have intended this to remain a more nominal position, but Taylor Branch in Pillar of Fire contends that Johnson pushed the Kennedy administration's actions further and faster for civil rights than Kennedy originally intended to go. Branch notes the irony of Johnson being the advocate for civil rights, when the Kennedy family had hoped that he would appeal to conservative southern voters. The new partnership gave Johnson half of the company's shares in return for management of the company. His brothers would receive thirty percent of the company. Johnson worked all hours of the day, going back and forth from the factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey to the office in New York, and by early 1888, Johnson & Johnson was making $25,000 a month.
