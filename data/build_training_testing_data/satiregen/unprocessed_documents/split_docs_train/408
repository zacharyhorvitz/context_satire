Sollman served on the Hillsboro school board from 2009 until 2017, in the 2013 election she defeated Rich Vial, also a future state representative. She served as board chair from 2011 until 2013. Sollman filed to run for the House after incumbent Democrat Joe Gallegos announced his retirement. In the general election, she defeated Republican Dan Mason and Libertarian Kyle Markley, receiving 52% of the vote. Gallegos was born in San Antonio, Texas, but raised in Portland, Oregon, where his parents relocated during World War II to work in the city's shipyards. As a young adult, he also worked in the shipyards before serving one year in the U.S. Air Force and three years with the Oregon Air National Guard during the Vietnam War. The 30 members of the Oregon State Senate are elected to four-year terms, and only half of those seats (15) are up for election every two years. In addition to these 15 regular elections, there were two special elections to determine who would complete the four-year terms of Senators that were replaced during the first half of their term. These 17 seats up for election were represented by 10 Democrats and 7 Republicans. The Democrats decreased their advantage over Republicans from 18-12 to 17-13 in the 2016 election.
