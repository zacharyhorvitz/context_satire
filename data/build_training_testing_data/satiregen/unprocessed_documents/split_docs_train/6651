In his book Excursions in and About Newfoundland During the Years 1839 and 1840, the geologist Joseph Beete Jukes describes the St. John's water dog. "A thin, short-haired, black dog came off-shore to us to-day. The animal was of a breed very different from what we understand by the term Newfoundland dog in England. He had a thin, tapering snout, a long thin tail, and rather thin, but powerful legs, with a lank body, – the hair short and smooth." In his book Excursions In and About Newfoundland During the Years 1839 and 1840 Vol. 1, the geologist Joseph Beete Jukes describes the St. John's water dog with both bemusement and admiration: "A thin, short-haired, black dog came off-shore to us to-day. The animal was of a breed very different from what we understand by the term Newfoundland dog in England. He had a thin, tapering snout, a long thin tail, and rather thin, but powerful legs, with a lank body, – the hair short and smooth." The song tells the story of two young lovers who meet again at the beach resort where they had first met during the previous summer. They have arrived early this year, because they had not had enough time together the year before for their relationship to even progress to their first kiss -- she asks if they should do that now. They had met when chasing the girl's childhood pet, a Labrador Retriever, as he played along the water's edge; this inspired her to give her new love the nickname "Labrador." The three of them chase across the beach as they had that first day, and she calls her love into her arms and asks (for the third time) if they should have their first kiss.
