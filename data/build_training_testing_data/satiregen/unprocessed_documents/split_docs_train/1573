Vincent T. Bugliosi Jr. (; August 18, 1934 – June 6, 2015) was an American attorney and New York Times bestselling author. During his eight years in the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, he successfully prosecuted 105 out of 106 felony jury trials, which included 21 murder convictions, and gained guilty verdicts in each case. He was best known for prosecuting Charles Manson and other defendants accused of the Tate–LaBianca murders of August 9–10, 1969. Although Manson did not physically participate in the murders, Bugliosi presented circumstantial evidence to show that he had orchestrated the killings.
