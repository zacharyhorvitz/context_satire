 With many South Florida residents fleeing their homes before Hurricane Irma, hospitals in Florida's southernmost county have put their own evacuation plans into motion. The three hospitals in Monroe County, which includes the Keys, are in the process of shutting their doors ahead of Irma's expected Sunday arrival. The county has also ordered a mandatory evacuation for residents. The Lower Keys Medical Center evacuated its remaining 11 patients Wednesday night in the North Carolina National Guard's C-130 aircraft, according to hospital spokeswoman Lynn Corbett-Winn.  The US military has ordered the evacuation of over five thousand personnel from a Naval Air Station in Florida in preparation for Hurricane Irma. Irma is now a Category 5 storm and one of the strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic. Currently, it is threatening to slam into Caribbean islands including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands with "potentially catastrophic" force on Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said. The military is braced for it to hit the US mainland and the current forecast suggests it could strike Florida over the weekend.  Several South Florida counties switched into emergency mode on Tuesday, planning evacuations, school closings and setting up shelters as Hurricane Irma, a powerful Category 5 storm, churned toward the Caribbean. With maximum sustained winds reaching 180 miles per hour, Irma is on track to hit the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in the coming days. After that, the storm is expected to continue west and possibly slam South Florida or another part of the continental United States. "There is an increasing chance of seeing some impacts from Irma in the Florida Peninsula and the Florida Keys later this week and this weekend," the National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday morning.
