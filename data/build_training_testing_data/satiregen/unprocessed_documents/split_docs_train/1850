The state registration for architects in Georgia required either an architecture degree (which League did not have) or ten years experience in a licensed office (which she did) and passing a week-long examination.

In addition to his travels, Louis was the focus of a media recruitment campaign encouraging African-American men to enlist in the Armed Services, despite the military's racial segregation. When he was asked about his decision to enter the racially segregated U.S. Army, he said: "Lots of things wrong with America, but Hitler ain't going to fix them." In 1943, Louis made an appearance in the wartime Hollywood musical This Is the Army, directed by Michael Curtiz. He appeared as himself in a musical number, "The Well-Dressed Man in Harlem," which emphasized the importance of African-American soldiers and promoted their enlistment.  Harriet Tubman may not have her face on a $20 bill, but plans for a biopic in her name are becoming a reality. The trailer for "Harriet" dropped Tuesday, with Cynthia Erivo as the titular abolitionist. Tubman's own escape from slavery led her to help hundreds of slaves find freedom during the US Civil War era through the Underground Railroad, changing the course of American history. "God don't mean people to own people," Tubman says in the trailer.
