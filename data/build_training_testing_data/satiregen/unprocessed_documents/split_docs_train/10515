 White House chief of staff John Kelly was interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller's team in recent months, three people with knowledge of the matter told CNN. Kelly responded to a narrow set of questions from special counsel investigators after White House lawyers initially objected to Mueller's request to do the interview earlier this summer, the sources said. Kelly is widely expected to leave his position in the coming days and is no longer on speaking terms with President Donald Trump, CNN reported earlier Friday. Kelly is the latest high-ranking White House official known to provide information for Mueller's investigation, though his interview marks a departure of sorts since Kelly didn't join the White House until July 2017.

Mueller, Trump and the truth "By the end of this week, we will know much more about the strength of Robert Mueller's hand and the threat his investigation poses to President Donald Trump and his administration." That's according to CNN legal analyst Elie Honig, who explains it all in this new CNN.com piece.  Michael Flynn's lawyer had it right back in March 2017 -- his client certainly has a story to tell. That special counsel Robert Mueller clearly agrees but is not ready to share the former national security adviser's tale with the American people cannot be anything but bad news for President Donald Trump and those around him. Mueller told a judge in a key filing Tuesday that Flynn, a retired general who was a key foreign policy aide during the Trump campaign, provided "substantial" help to his probe into Russia election interference in 2016. That help was so significant and timely, Mueller said in heavily redacted documents, that Flynn should serve no jail time for lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's envoy to the US and his business ties with Turkey.
