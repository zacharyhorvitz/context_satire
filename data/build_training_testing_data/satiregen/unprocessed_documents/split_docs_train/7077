During his childhood, O'Rourke accompanied his father Pat at campaign stops and other political events. While Pat was charismatic and outgoing, his son was more reserved. Pat would nudge Beto, suggesting he introduce himself to "this person or that person... I was an awkward and shy kid, so it was the last thing I wanted to do, but now I can look back and bless my experience in it."  For days, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney had been a lone Republican voice expressing concern about President Donald Trump's July phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump asked Ukraine's President to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family. Romney came to Washington promising to speak out against the President when the time called for it. Days ago, he became the first prominent elected Republican to convey his dismay about Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden, one of Trump's political rivals for the White House, and Biden's son at a time when Trump was withholding aid to Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or Hunter Biden.  President Donald Trump admitted Monday that he delayed aid to Ukraine ahead of a call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, when he pushed the leader to look into potential rival Joe Biden and his son's work, giving the excuse that he was waiting for European nations to contribute their fair share of aid and claiming there was "never any quid pro quo." "As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid. But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they're not doing it," Trump said Tuesday as he arrived at the United Nations ahead of his speech to the General Assembly.
