Jerry Falwell Jr.'s uncritical support for President Donald Trump, has been characterized as a repudiation of Christian values. The leadership's support for Trump has been an issue since his candidacy: a number of students protested the university's ties with Trump during his campaign, and were critical of LU president Jerry Falwell, Jr., over his staunch support of Trump. Mark DeMoss, chief of staff of Falwell, was forced to resign from Liberty's board of trustees after criticizing the university's close affiliation with Trump. Liberty University rescinded a speaking invitation of Jonathan Merritt, an alumnus of the school, after he criticized Liberty University. His son, Jerry Falwell Jr., is an American lawyer and university administrator, serving as the president of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia since his father's death. He is an ardent supporter of Donald Trump, both before and since his election as President of the United States. In contrast to his brother Jerry Jr., whose tenure at Liberty University has been marred by scandal and accusations of corruption, Jonathan Falwell's tenure at Thomas Road Baptist Church has been largely well-received and scandal-free. Jerry Jr. largely marginalized Jonathan from his roles at Liberty University after their father's death, allegedly due to the influence of Jerry Jr.'s wife Becki.
