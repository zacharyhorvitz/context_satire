In an August 2018 press conference, Sanders was asked multiple times to say that the media was not the "enemy of the people", and Sanders opted not to do so. That same month, The Washington Post reported that Sanders and her deputy Bill Shine strategized optimum times to release announcements that the security clearances of various Trump critics and officials involved in the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election had been revoked. The announcements were intended to be released to distract from news cycles that were unfavorable to the White House.  It is a sad day for democracy when the leader of the free world repeatedly calls the press the "enemy of the people," and his chief spokeswoman can't bring herself to say that isn't so. Yet that is what happened Thursday at a White House press briefing. CNN's Jim Acosta -- who was aggressively jeered at a Trump rally Tuesday --  asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to acknowledge that the mainstream news media is not in fact the enemy of the people -- as Ivanka Trump had done earlier that day. Sanders not only couldn't bring herself to acknowledge that, though given multiple opportunities to do so, but defended the President's stance toward the press as "completely understandable" given his belief that the media is biased against him.  The ultra-competitive White House press corps is displaying something rare and refreshing: Solidarity. Journalists reacted with dismay when the Trump administration barred CNN's Kaitlan Collins from attending a presidential event in the Rose Garden. Two White House officials, Bill Shine and Sarah Sanders, told Collins that she asked "inappropriate" questions during Trump's meeting with European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. So the ban was retaliatory in nature.
