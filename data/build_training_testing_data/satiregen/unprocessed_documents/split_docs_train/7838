One day, Timmy reunites with a girl from his childhood named Tootie (Daniella Monet), who had an obsessive crush on him for years. She has grown into a beautiful activist and Timmy falls for her instantly. His fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, scheme to repel Tootie, afraid that he is finally growing up and may no longer need them. Timmy is torn between his love for Tootie and his desire to keep his fairy godparents. The television movie is set in the city of Dimmsdale and centers on Timmy Turner, his fairy godparents Cosmo and Wanda, and his fairy godbrother Poof. The events of the movie take place at the end of the series. Timmy is now twenty-three years old, but is still in fifth grade with his fairy-obsessed fifth grade teacher, Mr. Crocker. Timmy finds a loophole in the fairy rulebook: if he continues to act like a child, he will get to keep his fairies. Although Timmy is saddened deeply by the departure of Cosmo, Wanda, and Poof, he is happy to be free to finally pursue more mature behaviors, as he had longed to do. However, he learns from Jorgen von Strangle that because of his courage, a new law was passed in Fairy World that will now permit him to keep his fairy godparents forever, as long as he makes unselfish wishes. Because of this, Tootie and Timmy plan to start a charity organization in which they will make wishes that will mend all of the world's problems or travesties, flying away in a magical van. Magnate was sent to a mental hospital after claiming that fairies exist, and his secretary became CEO of the company turning it to environmental friendly enterprise.
