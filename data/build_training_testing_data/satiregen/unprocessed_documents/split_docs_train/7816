 Late night hosts were besides themselves on Monday night. Especially Stephen Colbert. "I come to you tonight a broken man," Colbert said to his "Late Show" audience. "Because just this afternoon I was shocked by this breaking 'nooch.'"  White House Director of Communications Anthony Scaramucci called into CNN's "New Day" for an all-encompassing interview Thursday morning. Read the full transcript: ALISYN CAMEROTA: Ryan , so sorry to interrupt you right now. If you would stand by for a second that would be great because we actually have Anthony Scaramucci on the phone. CHRIS CUOMO: Right, so, let's get him.  Anthony Scaramucci, the new White House communications director who was brought in to bring order to a press shop in turmoil, called into CNN's "New Day" on Thursday and all but blamed chief of staff Reince Priebus for leaking information. In the remarkable interview, which lasted for more than a half hour, the developing power struggle inside the West Wing was on full display, with Scaramucci at one point warning that "the fish stinks from the head down." Scaramucci, whose relationship with Priebus has been fraught since he was initially unable to secure a White House job after President Donald Trump's election, did little to show his relationship with Priebus was changing and said it was up to the chief of staff to show he was not leaking. Hours earlier, the White House communications director -- who notably announced last week that he reports to Trump, not Priebus -- copied the chief of staff in a tweet about leaks before deleting it.
