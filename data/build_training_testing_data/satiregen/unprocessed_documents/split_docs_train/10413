If you need proof that triumph can have many faces, look no further than this stunning photo of recent West Point graduate Alix Idrache. Idrache graduated and became a second lieutenant along with more than 950 of his classmates Monday. Amidst the pomp and circumstance, an Army Staff Sergeant photographer caught him during an emotional moment. While making it through the U.S. Military Academy is certainly accomplishment enough, Idrache left a beautiful message on the school's Instagram that explained why the day was so special to him.  Last week, a Shanghai-based French photographer named Benoit Floren√ßon posted video of a commercial he'd seen on local television. Nearly 9 million YouTube views later, the ad has become a viral phenomenon, as well as the epicenter of a turbulent global debate over anti-black racism in the world's most populous and fastest-emerging superpower. In the ad, a pretty Chinese woman responds to the flirtatious advances of an African house painter by popping a detergent pellet into his mouth and then shoving him into her washing machine. After a few seconds of calmly listening to him scream and struggle, she lifts the lid with a smile to reveal that the black man has been transformed -- into the pale-skinned young Chinese man of her dreams.
