 Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said the city "must do better" to address racism after a stunning Department of Justice report revealed a range of abuses committed against African American residents by the city's police force. "We must do better not only as a city but as a state and a country. We must all work to address issues of racial disparity in all aspects of our society," he said at a press conference Wednesday night. Knowles outlined a number of steps the city is taking to comply with DOJ recommendations and reform its force, which was found in the DOJ report to have engaged in systemic racism against the city's African American residents.  Ferguson's police chief is ducking questions about his department and his future there in the wake of a scathing federal report. "I need to have time to really analyze this report so I can comment on it," Chief Tom Jackson said Thursday in an exclusive interview with CNN. He spoke one day after the Justice Department released its 102-page report, which found rampant racism within the Ferguson Police Department. It specifically faulted officers for seeing residents as "sources of revenue," a practice that disproportionately targeted African-Americans.  Early Thursday -- during the ongoing protests that continue to shake Ferguson, Missouri -- two police officers were shot. Such violence and lawlessness should never be tolerated. But the unrest during which it occurred demonstrates that the people of Ferguson have lost all confidence in their police department. And the resignation of the police chief this week won't be enough to restore faith in law and order.
