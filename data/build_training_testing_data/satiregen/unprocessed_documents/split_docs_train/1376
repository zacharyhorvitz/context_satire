 The turmoil in Ukraine has swept aside its president, brought about the release a prominent opposition leader and raised fears the country could break apart. After the bloodshed in the streets of Kiev last week -- the deadliest violence Ukraine has suffered since its independence 22 years ago --  the political twists and turns came thick and fast over the weekend. As a new week begins, uncertainty has taken a hold in the divided nation as Ukraine tries to reshape its political landscape. An arrest warrant has been issued for ousted President Viktor Yanukovych over the killings of civilians, a government official said Monday.  President  Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin went to great lengths to portray their phone call Friday as evidence the two leaders were working together to stabilize the situation in Ukraine. Absent were the accusations they traded the past two months over the future of the former Soviet republic. The Obama administration continues to dismiss the notion of a new Cold War with Russia. But the louder their protests, the more apparent the chill has become.  As Ukraine's new leaders accused Russia of declaring war, Russia's Prime Minister warned Sunday that blood could be spilled amid growing instability in the neighboring nation. Kiev mobilized troops and called up military reservists in a rapidly escalating crisis that has raised fears of a conflict. And world leaders pushed for a diplomatic solution. In a post on his official Facebook page, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called the recent ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych a "seizure of power."
