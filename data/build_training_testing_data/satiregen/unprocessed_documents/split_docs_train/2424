 Meals on Wheels received 50 times the typical amount of daily donations on Thursday after the White House proposed cuts to some of the program's sources of funding, a spokesperson for the group said. Volunteer sign-ups also jumped, increasing by 500%, according to Jenny Bertolette, a spokeswoman for Meals on Wheels America. Bertolette said the support to the national Meals on Wheels office has been "amazing" and "very overwhelming." Several local Meals on Wheels organizations said they had received similar support.  President Trump's seemingly top priority is to keep the promises he made on the campaign trail and remake the federal government. But judging from his first set of budget proposals to Congress, doing so is likely to come at the expense of those in need. Advocates for lower-income Americans see the president's proposed spending cuts in his "skinny" budget as an assault. "This isn't a budget that will make America great again. In March 2017, President Donald Trump's proposed budget would make cuts to block grants that go towards spending on Meals on Wheels. Defending these cuts, director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney said that "Meals on Wheels sounds great" but that the program is one of many that is "just not showing any results."
