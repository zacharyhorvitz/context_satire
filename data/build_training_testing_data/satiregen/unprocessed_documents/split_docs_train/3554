Stephenson as librarian of Congress in 1861 and the appointment is regarded as the most political to date.

Despite his new job, Stephenson's focus was on non-library affairs; three weeks into his term, he left Washington, D.C. to serve as a volunteer aide-de-camp at the battles of Chancellorsville and Gettysburg during the American Civil War.
