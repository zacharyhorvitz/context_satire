 Donald Trump's lone Senate supporter, Jeff Sessions, on Monday dismissed as "desperate measures" coordination by the candidate's two rivals aimed at derailing the businessman's march to the Republican presidential nomination. "It certainly indicates that they believe Trump is ahead and desperate measures are needed to stop him," the Alabama Republican told reporters in the Capitol. Sen. Ted. Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich, the two Republicans still battling Trump, announced a plan late Sunday where they would divide up some of the remaining states in an effort to prevent Trump from getting the 1,237 delegates he needs to secure the nomination. On July 2, 1915, prior to the United States' entry into World War I, Eric Muenter (aka Frank Holt), a German professor who wanted to stop American support of the Allies of World War I, exploded a bomb in the reception room of the U.S. Senate. The next morning he tried to assassinate J. P. Morgan, Jr., son of the financier, at his home on Long Island, New York. In a letter to the Washington Evening Star published after the explosion, Muenter, writing under an assumed name, said he hoped that the detonation would "make enough noise to be heard above the voices that clamor for war." J.P. Morgan's company served as Great Britain's principal U.S. purchasing agent for munitions and other war supplies.  Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that Bernie Sanders can't win the Democratic nomination, but he won't call on the Vermont senator to quit the race. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, the Nevada senator was asked if he thought Sanders had a path to the presidential nomination. "No, I don't," Reid replied. Reid said he was comfortable with Sanders' vow to take the campaign to the convention in July, saying he "should do what he has to do."
