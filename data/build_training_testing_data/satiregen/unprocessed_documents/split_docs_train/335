Prior to the DoJ report, a survey by Albuquerque's KOAT-TV found that 42% of the city's residents trusted police, 22% distrusted them, and the remainder "fell somewhere in the middle." City council member Rey Garduño characterized these results as "not good". Mayor Richard J. Berry said he continued to "stand behind" the police department. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the department appeared in several episodes of the television show Cops. However, beginning in 2001 Mayor Martin Chávez refused to allow the program to shoot additional episodes, explaining that "the city's police officers are portrayed in a good light, but the rest of the city looks horrible." A newspaper report on the Cops ban at the time noted a post made to a television enthusiast website commented "How much crime can there be in Albuquerque, New Mexico? They taped so many shows in that town, I'm ready never to visit." On 11 May 2010, a statement appeared on the Guy Manning website indicating that he would no longer be partaking in any future Tangent activities, although he has provided Acoustic Guitar  for 2013's "Le Sacre du Travail".
