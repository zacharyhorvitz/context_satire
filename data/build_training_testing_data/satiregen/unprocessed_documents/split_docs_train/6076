On August 9, 1964, United States President Lyndon Johnson personally placed an order over the phone, with Joe Haggar, Jr. for six pairs of Haggar slacks from the Oval Office. Johnson stated that Haggar pants were "the best  had anywhere in the United States." The President preferred the Dallas manufacturer's slacks because they provided more room. Other manufacturer's slacks "cut him" and wearing their pants was like "riding a wire fence." Haggar's innovations reached beyond apparel with their creation of the "Haggar Hanger" in 1971, which for the first time allowed retailers to sell pants on hanging fixtures instead of flat folded on tables. In the 1980s, Haggar became the first in the apparel industry to adopt EDI quick-response inventory replenishment, and to use UPC codes to ticket merchandise. In 1987, Haggar invented and received a patent for the "Size Strip" sticker, which is used by almost all brands of pants today to identify size and fit on folded bottoms programs. By 1971, Haggar had been declared the number one brand of pants in the United States and began manufacturing sport coats, vests, and Haggar "Custom Fit" suits, which allowed customers to purchase jackets and pants separately, thus creating a new menswear category: suit separates.
