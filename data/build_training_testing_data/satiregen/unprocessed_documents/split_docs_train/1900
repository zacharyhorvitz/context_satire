As his college athletics had taught him, Miller knew that whenever he got knocked down, the best thing he could do was get back up and start over. So the day after he lost American Medicorp to a hostile takeover, Alan B. Miller started a new company in the same industry. The new company was called Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS) and was started with funding from venture capitalists, along with money put up by himself and several former American Medicorp employees who decided to follow Miller into his new venture. In 1993's third instalment of Prime Suspect, Miller played a young man victimized as a child by a paedophile. His first notable acting role that year was in the soap opera EastEnders where he played Jonathan Hewitt. Miller later revealed he had been offered a contract to remain on the show but declined: "It was five weeks' work and I made more money there than I ever had in my life. Then they offered me a year's contract. Miller has said that he makes integrity and ethics a foundation for himself and the company he runs. “I believe that reputation is one of the most important assets for any business and should be guarded carefully,” he says. “While it takes a lifetime to build a good reputation, it can vanish overnight.”
