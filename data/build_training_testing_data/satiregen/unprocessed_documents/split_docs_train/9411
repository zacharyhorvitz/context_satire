In November 2012, the couple announced that Stone was pregnant with their first child, due mid-2013. From her diary's and letters it is clear that Tyra was a colorful and exciting androgynous personality, besides being an extremely proficient artist. Her whole life she stayed single, but she had several romances and received many offers of marriage. She loved her freedom and hated to be dominated by men or women. She was very ambitious and  a real control-freak in  traveling, doing business and so on. Stone has a close relationship with her family. She says: "I am blessed with a great family and great people around me that would be able to kick me in the shins if I ever for one minute got lost up in the clouds. I've been really lucky in that sense." During the production of The Amazing Spider-Man in 2010, Stone dated co-star Andrew Garfield.
