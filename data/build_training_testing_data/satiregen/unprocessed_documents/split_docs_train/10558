 For Max, the passage of Indiana's new religious freedom law feels a lot like high school. Max is transgender. The 26-year-old was born a female but identifies as a man. That was a tough experience in Evansville: looking like a girl, everyone treating you like one, but not feeling at home in your skin.  Indiana Gov. Mike Pence says concerns that his state's new "religious freedom" law will allow businesses to turn away LGBT customers is the result of a "tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding." But he refused Sunday to answer at least six yes-or-no questions about whether the measure legalizes discrimination against gays and lesbians. And he said he won't support legislation that would clean up the public relations mess by adding protections based on sexual orientation to Indiana's anti-discrimination laws.  Indiana Gov. Mike Pence stirred up controversy this week when he signed a "religious freedom" bill into law. The law has businesses and civil rights groups up in arms and threatening -- or in some cases pledging -- to boycott the state. The reaction has gotten so hot, that on Saturday, Pence told The Indianapolis Star that he is working with legislators to amend the law and "clarify" that it does not promote discrimination.
