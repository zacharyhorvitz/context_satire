The real estate business practice of "blockbusting" was a for-profit catalyst for white flight, and a means to control non-white migration. By subterfuge, real estate agents would facilitate black people buying a house in a white neighborhood, either by buying the house themselves, or via a white proxy buyer, and then re-selling it to the black family. The remaining white inhabitants (alarmed by real estate agents and the local news media), fearing devalued residential property, would quickly sell, usually at a loss. The realtors profited from these en masse sales and the ability to resell to the incoming black families, through arbitrage and the sales commissions from both groups. A study of school choice in Copenhagen found that an immigrant proportion of below 35% in the local schools did not affect parental choice of schools. If the percentage of immigrant children rose above this level, native Danes are far more likely to choose other schools. Immigrants who speak Danish at home also opt out. Other immigrants, often more recent ones, stay with local schools. In a study performed at Ã–rebro University, mothers of young children were interviewed to study attitudes on swedishness, multiculturalism and segregation. It concluded that while many expressed values as ethnic diversity being an enriching factor, but when in practice it came to choosing schools or choosing district to move to, ensuring the children had an access to a school with robust Swedish majority as they didn't want their children to grow up in a school as a minority and wanted them to be in a good Swedish language learning environment.
