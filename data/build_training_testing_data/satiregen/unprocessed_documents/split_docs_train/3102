Turrentine-Agee was born Ruth Evelyn Tyler on February 4, 1946 in St. Louis, Missouri, She was born as the third sibling in an eighteen sibling household. Her father, Cleveland Tyler, was a deacon in the church, and her mother is Ruthie Mae Tyler. She started singing on stage at the age of three because her father was in a quartet, and later they formed a family gospel girl group, The Tylerettes. She graduated high school by seventeen, and this enabled her to make her first record.  The Saudi teenager who fled her family and was granted asylum in Canada said Tuesday that she was fortunate to have escaped. But many other young women in Saudi Arabia like her are not able to get away and take control of their lives, Rahaf Mohammed, 18, said at a press conference Tuesday. "I am one of the lucky ones. I know there are unlucky women who disappeared after trying to escape, or who could not do anything to change their reality," she said. At the hospital, Samantha, Ted and Tami-Lynn rejoice when John recovers, although he pretends to be dead as payback for Ted previously pretending to be brain dead. Patrick Meighan decides to take the case, telling them he has been inspired by John's selflessness and Ted's emotions over his nearly fallen friend. Meighan gets the ruling overturned by demonstrating that Ted is self-aware, that he feels complex emotions, and is capable of empathy. Outside the court, Ted re-proposes to Tami-Lynn.
