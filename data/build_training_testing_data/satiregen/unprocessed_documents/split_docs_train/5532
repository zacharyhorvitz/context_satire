 The White House, facing mounting outcry and contradictory statements about President Donald Trump's practice of separating children from their parents at the US border, entered damage control mode on Monday. Press secretary Sarah Sanders delayed her briefing almost four hours as Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, was flown back from New Orleans to face reporters. Originally scheduled for 1:15 p.m., the briefing was subsequently pushed to 3:30 p.m., then 4 p.m. and finally to 5 p.m. The effort to put Nielsen in front of cameras to explain the policy reflected heated internal West Wing conversations and Trump's growing frustration that his own administration's practice is drawing ire and making him appear heartless.  Cindy Madrid on Thursday spoke to her 6-year-old daughter, Alisson, for the first time since they were separated after crossing the border, according to a spokesperson with Southwest Key Programs shelters, which is housing the girl. Madrid is in a detention facility in Texas, and hadn't seen or talked to her daughter, although she heard her daughter's voice in an anguished voice recording released by investigative news nonprofit ProPublica. In the audio recording, other separated children sob desperately. Jeff Eller, spokesperson for Southwest Key Programs, said Alisson was assigned a case manager and got to speak to her aunt. T. Christian Miller of ProPublica had been reporting on law enforcement failures in identifying rapists throughout 2015. In August, he learned of the case of Marie and contacted her lawyer, discovering that Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project was already working on a similar story. They began to collaborate, with Armstrong writing about Marie's story in Washington and Miller writing about the police investigation in Colorado. Marie agreed to speak to Armstrong after six months of communication.
