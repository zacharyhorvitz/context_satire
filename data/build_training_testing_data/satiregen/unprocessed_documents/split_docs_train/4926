 When the first bomb went off near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, emergency personnel knew to expect another. It occurred just 12 seconds later, and the first responders already present for Monday's  world-famous race that drew tens of thousands of visitors to the city immediately started moving people away from what had been a celebratory scene. In clearing the area so quickly, authorities acted on lessons learned from past terrorist attacks such as the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the Atlanta Olympics bombing in 1996 and the September 11, 2001, attacks, according to security experts. Major public events such as a marathon in a nation that prizes personal freedom can never be made perfectly safe, said Juliette Kayyem, a CNN contributor and former homeland security official.  On Monday Tom Beusse, the president of the USA TODAY Sports Media Group was running the Boston Marathon. About three minutes after he had completed the race twin explosions erupted near the finish line. Beusse estimates he was about 150 yards away. This morning he joins a special edition of “Starting Point” to discuss the smoke and the devastating aftermath.  In the hours after two explosions ripped through Boylston Street just feet from the finish line of Monday's Boston Marathon, people across the city rallied around each other, showing, as one runner said, "the human spirit is still alive." At a Starbucks across from the Westin Copley Place, a hotel filled with out-of-town marathoners, manager Sol Elta and his staff set up an impromptu feeding table offering free coffee and pastries to anyone walking by. The idea was sparked by a woman in Philadelphia who called the store and offered to donate $100 worth of coffee and pastries to people affected by the bombing. "I was shocked," Elta said.
