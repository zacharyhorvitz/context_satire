After undergraduate and graduate work at San Jose State University, where he appeared in 16 productions, he and his wife, actress Judith Long, moved to Seattle, Washington, where they spent three years at the Seattle Repertory Theatre. After two years at Actors Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky, Anderson headed to Washington, D.C., to join the Arena Stage. His debut with Arena Stage was in the starring role of Randle McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Anderson went on to spend 17 years with Arena Stage, appearing in nearly 100 of their productions. Of humble origin, Randle Moore was born to John Milton Moore and Jennie Elizabeth Mooring (n√©e Jones), both Tennessee natives. His father was a farmer; so Moore spent much of his young life helping in the cotton fields. He eventually worked for others in the area at times for as little as fifty cents a day. In his thirteenth year, Randle raised an eight-bale cotton crop on his own, and used the proceeds to take a course at Draughon's Business College in Texarkana, Arkansas. At the time of his graduation, he regularly played with his band in small Hollywood clubs, and when his band finally went into the studio with a producer, Benson was inspired to become a record producer.
