He lives for three things: his beloved chair in front of the TV, his unsuccessful racing greyhounds Repco Lad and Gay Akubra and his Holden Kingswood car (late in the show's run Ted traded-in the Kingswood, which had gone out of production around the time the series began, for Holden's replacement mid-range family car, the Commodore). His long-suffering wife, the vague and dithering Thelma (Judi Farr), was cast as a traditional housewife trapped by Ted's conservative family views, but she often got her own back on Ted (this often included using old Myer receipts she had hidden in a drawer to fool Ted into thinking she paid less for a new item, often clothes, than she really had). The Sutton Place project was developed by Max Tanenbaum of York Steel, and lawyer David Dennis. Architectural firm Webb Zerafa Menkès Housden – the descendant of Peter Dickinson Associates – designed the building, which along with the hotel included luxury apartments on the upper floors. The top floor of the hotel, thirty-three stories high, held the restaurant "Stop 33" which featured a starlight ceiling and tall windows. Also included in the structure were two pools, a pub, a banquet hall, and an office building. Played by Judi Farr. Thelma, known as "Thel" for short, is Ted's wife and mother of Craig and Greta. She often answers the telephone with catchphrases in the hope of winning the latest prize from TV Week or whatever competition is currently running on the radio. Thelma also keeps a drawer full of old receipts to show Ted after buying expensive items from Myer (she simply holds her fingers over the date and waves the receipt at him, showing a small purchase).
