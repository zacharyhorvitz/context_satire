During an October 17 press conference, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said he "was involved with the process" of the freezing of military aid. Mulvaney gave his account of why Trump decided to hold back military aid to Ukraine. One, Trump felt the other European countries were not doing enough. Two, Trump felt Ukraine was a "corrupt place" which included having "corruption related to the DNC server" with regard to "what happened in 2016".  Everyone has a breaking point. It's worth remembering that fact at this moment as congressional Republicans find themselves confronted with a cavalcade of troubling news stories about President Donald Trump and his conduct in office. Because while elected GOP officials have almost totally capitulated to Trump's hostile takeover of their party, there is always a point at which you simply cannot look even quasi-objectively at the actions of this president and conclude that standing behind him remains the right (or even defensible) thing to do. And this week sure looks like just that sort of breaking point moment. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified that he conducted his work with Giuliani at the "express direction of the president" and that he believed Giuliani was assigned to lead the Ukrainian quid pro quo scheme on Trump's behalf. He also said everyone in the administration "was in the loop", specifically naming John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, Ulrich Brechbuhl and Mike Pence, saying "they knew what they were doing and why". Sondland also said Trump had never directly told him the aid package to Ukraine was related to the announcement of investigations, but that Sondland nevertheless believed it was and that he understood a potential White House invitation for Zelensky to be contingent on Ukraine announcing investigations into the 2016 elections and Burisma.
