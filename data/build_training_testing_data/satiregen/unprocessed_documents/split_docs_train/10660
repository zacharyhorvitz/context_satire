 Protests against Wal-Mart returned in cities across the country on Thursday, with 21 demonstrators arrested at a rally in Los Angeles. Organizers said Thursday's protests, planned in 15 cities, were the largest such action against the retailer since demonstrations on Black Friday last year that they claim drew over 30,000 people. The demonstrations are part of the Making Change at Walmart campaign, which is spearheaded by the United Food & Commercial Workers union. Wal-Mart workers in the U.S. aren't unionized. In October 2019, Walmart announced that customers in 2,000 locations in 29 states can use the grocery pickup service for their adult beverage purchases. Walmart will also deliver adult beverages from nearly 200 stores across California and Florida. On January 11, 2018, Walmart announced that 63 Sam's Club locations in cities including Memphis, Houston, Seattle, and others would be closing. Some of the stores had already liquidated, without notifying employees; some employees learned by a company-wide email delivered January 11. All of the 63 stores were gone from the Sam's Club website as of the morning of January 11. Walmart said that ten of the stores will become e-commerce distribution centers and employees can reapply to work at those locations.
