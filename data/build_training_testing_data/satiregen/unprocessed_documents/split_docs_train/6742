 Scientists overwhelmingly agree that the climate is changing and getting warmer, and that humans are contributing. Americans overwhelmingly agree with the scientists, according to public opinion polls. Seventy percent say climate change is happening, according to a study from researchers on climate communications at Yale and George Mason universities in January, and 55% said it is mostly caused by humans. They have also supported US adherence to the Paris Accord -- 70% -- the enormous, nearly worldwide international agreement that countries must act to keep global temperatures at bay.  "Wonder Woman" won't be the biggest box office opening of all time. It's highly unlikely that it'll even be the biggest opening of this year. But it is poised to set a box office record arguably more meaningful, and hopefully with more long-term impact on the industry: the biggest opening for a female director ever. If the superhero film, which stars Gal Gadot and was directed by Patty Jenkins, matches expectations, it'll undoubtedly be seen as a success by Hollywood standards, but it has the chance to mean more.  You know a movie is good when less than a week after it opens fans already want the sequel. "Wonder Woman" has turned out to be so many things to so many people: an action-packed movie, a masterpiece of feminism, and proof that DC Comics can pull off a successful superhero film. "Wonder Woman" has lassoed major money its opening week. Bringing in more than $100 million, the film became the biggest opening ever for a female director, edging out the former title holder "Fifty Shades of Grey" by just over $17 million.
