 Britain's Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, is spending a second day in a central London hospital Tuesday after being admitted with acute morning sickness. "The Duchess of Cambridge is continuing to feel better," a St. James's Palace spokesman told CNN Tuesday afternoon. Her husband, Prince William, arrived Tuesday morning to visit her at King Edward VII Hospital, after spending much of the day at her bedside Monday. The news that he and Catherine are expecting their first child after 19 months of marriage was announced by the palace Monday as she was admitted for treatment, and followed months of tabloid speculation. Michael Middleton, the father of the Duchess of Cambridge, was born into a wealthy family with ties to the British aristocracy. His family had entertained members of the British royal family in Leeds from the 1920s. Shortly before his daughter married Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, in April 2011, he was granted a coat of arms as the armigerous head of the family. Members of the Middleton family have been related to the British royal family by marriage since the wedding of Catherine Middleton and Prince William in April 2011, when she became the Duchess of Cambridge.
