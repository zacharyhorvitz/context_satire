In the epilogue, Thule Jace comes to the court of the Seelie Queen with Ash, asking to remain there with him, but also to have Clary brought to him. The Queen reveals that it is now impossible to break the parabatai bond, as to break it requires the Mortal Sword cutting through the original rune designed by Jonathon Shadowhunter, that remains in the Silent City. Emma and Julian reunite shortly, and again Emma is frustrated with Julian's emotional block, as he lies without guilt, and pretends to apologize in order to calm her. They are interrupted by Nene, who warns that the Queen intends to take the copy of the volume to the Unseelie King in order to regain her son, Ash. Nene suggests they cloak themselves and join the procession, disguised as her and Fergus. Mark, Kieran and Cristina arrive in Faerie and pass one of Prince Oban's revels. For this reason they are more cautious, as Kieran is a traitor to his father. The King of Cats hesitantly agrees to lead them, but not before Mark drinks what he believes to be fruit juice and falls asleep, forcing Kieran and Cristina to carry him together. Emma and Julian realize that all the faeries in the Queen's revel are being closely inspected, and fall back from the line, heading toward the wall of thorns that protects the Unseelie King's tower.
