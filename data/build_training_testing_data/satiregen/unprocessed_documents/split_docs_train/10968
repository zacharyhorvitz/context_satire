Five of the six wives featured on the sixth season returned for the seventh. It was revealed that Aviva Drescher had been fired from the series, shortly after the conclusion of season six. Andy Cohen later spoke of the firing of Drescher on a segment called Ask Andy, saying "I think that that was a situation where we listened to the fans." In  March, 2016, Drescher has said she would do The Real Housewives of New York City again, as it was good platform for her to "raise awareness for amputees, and opened up a lot of business opportunities" for her. Shortly after reports circulated on Bethenny Frankel's return to the series, on October 1, 2014 Frankel revealed to SiriusXM Radio host, Jennifer Hutt, that she was working with Andy Cohen on two different projects as well as revealing that Bravo have been asking her to return for years. October 2014, it was announced that Bethenny Frankel was returning to the series in season seven after a three-year hiatus from the series. Frankel returned to the series despite claiming she had quit reality television for her talk show Bethenny and that she wouldn't return to 'The Real Housewives of New York City. Frankel stated that she was excited for her return, saying "It feels like the first season when it was fresh and new and unknown," as well as speaking about the network, "Bravo has always been the place on television where I have the freedom to be unfiltered, honest and inappropriate." Hathaway believes that Blunt's career took off because of her role. "I've never witnessed a star being born before," Hathaway says. "That's the first time I watched it happen." Blunt agrees that it was "a night and day change" for herâ€”the day after the film was released, she told Variety, the staff at the coffee shop she had been going to for breakfast every morning in Los Angeles suddenly recognized her.
