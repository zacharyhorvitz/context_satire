 Houston, we have a problem. The historic Apollo Mission Control Center at the Johnson Space Center in Houston -- where NASA helped put a man on the moon 50 years ago -- is in desperate need of repair after years of wear-and-tear, a nonprofit group said. The group, Space Center Houston, operates a large space education center nearby and conducts tours of the Johnson Space Center -- a sprawling and active NASA campus -- and the now-shuttered control room is one stop along the way. The nonprofit wants to restore the room to its Apollo-era glory, right down to the ash trays and notebooks that used to litter its counter tops. By 1961, although it was yet to launch a person into space, the STG was confident that Project Mercury had overcome its initial setbacks, and the United States had overtaken the Soviet Union as the most advanced nation in space technology. The STG began considering Mercury Mark II, a two-person successor to the original Mercury spacecraft. This confidence was shattered on April 12, 1961, when the Soviet Union launched Vostok 1, and cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to orbit the Earth. In response, President John F. Kennedy announced a far more ambitious goal on May 25, 1961: to put a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. NASA turned the infrared space survey telescope WISE back on in 2013 to look for NEOs, and it found some during the course of its operation. NEOcam competed in the highly competitive Discovery program, which became more so due to a low mission rate in the 2010s. Also the Mars Scout Program was terminated at that time, further increasing competition. From its start until 2010, ten missions where launched, only two more mission were launched by 2020 (to the Moon and Mars), additionally the Mars Scout program had launched two additional programs to the planet Mars, which competed with NEOcam as well as more obscure destinations like Venus, which has had no dedicated mission since the 1980s.
