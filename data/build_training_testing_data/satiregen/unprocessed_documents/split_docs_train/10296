On November 2, 2018, it was announced that Hulu had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. Additional executive producers were reported to include Ira Ungerleider, Tom Ackerley, and Matt Spicer. Ungerleider was also set to serve as the series' showrunner and Spicer as the director of the first episode, replacing the previously announced Laing. Further production companies involved with the series were now expected to include ABC Signature Studios. In the summer of 2005, FX debuted two new comedy series, Starved, about the daily lives of four friends with eating disorders who live in New York City; and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, about the usually very politically incorrect comic misadventures of four people who own a bar in the titular city. Both of these shows feature frank sexual dialogue and strong language, and were pitched as "The Dark Side of Comedy." Starved was derided by groups that sought to publicize eating disorders and was cancelled after its first season due to low ratings. Conversely, Sunny quickly became a critical darling, consistently achieved high viewership, and was picked up for a second season within days of its first-season finale. On May 3, 2017, The Handmaid's Tale was renewed for a second season to premiere in 2018. Moss told the news media that the subsequent episodes would cover further developments in the story, filling in some of the unanswered questions and continuing the narrative already "finished" in the book. The second season consists of 13 episodes and began filming in fall 2017. Alexis Bledel returned as a series regular.
