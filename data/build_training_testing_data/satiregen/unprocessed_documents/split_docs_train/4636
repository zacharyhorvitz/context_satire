Johnson led a department of over 13,400 officers, the second-largest police department in the United States, who defended use of force training, more community policing and a court monitor to oversee department-wide reforms which included the DOJ and the Chicago Police Accountability Task Force (CPATF). The CPATF was initiated by Mayor Rahm Emanuel to investigate the shooting of Laquan McDonald and was once headed by the present Mayor of Chicago Lori Lightfoot. Johnson was appointed superintendent in 2016 by Mayor Rahm Emanuel to restore the public's trust after Emanuel delayed releasing the video of Jason Van Dyke's fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald for over a year. Johnson said that the Laquan McDonald incident changed Chicago's trust in the police department and that officer morale fell as a result of the lack of trust.  Stung by the level of violence last weekend, Chicago officials pledged Tuesday to deploy more officers in neighborhoods that have seen a surge in shootings. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters an additional 430 officers are being put on street duty, with 200 more to be on patrol over the weekend. Some officers will have their hours extended or vacations canceled. Others are being reassigned from other duties, officials said.  During the weekend in Chicago, 66 people were shot, 12 of them fatally, between Friday at 6 p.m. and Sunday at 11:59 p.m. "It's no secret that we had an unacceptably violent weekend," Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said. The spate of shootings left Chicago officials visibly frustrated during a Monday press conference, in which they said gun offenders needed to be held accountable, and they pressed for more community cooperation to stem the crimes. In all, over the weekend, there were 33 shooting incidents. Fourteen juveniles were shot, and two 17-year-olds were killed.
