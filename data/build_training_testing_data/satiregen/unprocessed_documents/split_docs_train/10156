 Protesters rallied in New York Wednesday on the anniversary of the death of Eric Garner, an African-American father who died after officers tried to apprehend him five years ago. The rallies took place a day after the Justice Department said it was declining to bring federal charges against New York police officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is accused of using a chokehold on Garner in July 2014. The decision angered Garner's family. Protesters demanded justice for Garner's death and called for Pantaleo and other officers to be fired, directing anger at New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. On December 3, 2014, following a grand jury decision not to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner, de Blasio said in a speech that he and his African American wife, Chirlane McCray, had had many conversations with their biracial son about taking "special care in any encounters he has with the police officers who are there to protect him." De Blasio also "offered qualified support for protesters after the grand jury decision not to charge the officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York City". The shooting occurred just weeks after a grand jury decided not to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo, who was responsible for the death of Eric Garner on July 17, 2014. The grand jury's decision resulted in widespread protests in New York City and across the nation against police brutality and the lack of accountability for it. The protests also coincided with widespread protests in response to a grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9. Brinsley's motive to kill the NYPD officers was motivated by outrage over the two deaths.
