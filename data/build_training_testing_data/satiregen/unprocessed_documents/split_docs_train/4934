 Donald Trump is doing a very poor job of not caring that his former friend Anthony Scaramucci has turned on him. "Just another disgruntled former employee who got fired for gross incompetence," Trump tweeted Tuesday morning of his former White House communications director. That Trump tweet came less than 12 hours after this one, again on the Mooch: "Nobody ever heard of this dope until he met me. He only lasted 11 days!"  In the midst of answering a question about the ongoing trade war with China on Wednesday, President Donald Trump turned from reporters, looked to heavens and proclaimed, "I am the chosen one." He was, ostensibly, joking -- and, days later, the President said in a string of Saturday tweets that reporters knew he "was kidding, being sarcastic, and just having fun." The point he was trying to make is that past presidents should have dealt with the inequities in the United States' relationship with China but didn't, leaving him to handle it. But as always with Trump, his jokes are freighted with what he believes to be lots and lots of truth.  As protests gripped Hong Kong this week, President Donald Trump had some advice for Chinese President Xi Jinping on how to handle the clashes. "I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it. Personal meeting?" Trump tweeted on Wednesday.
