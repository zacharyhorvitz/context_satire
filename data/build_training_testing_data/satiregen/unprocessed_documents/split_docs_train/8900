 President Donald Trump has tried to quell talk of chaos in his administration for days, but the last two weeks inside the West Wing have been anything but calm. Over the last 14 days, five top Trump administration officials -- from one of Trump's most trusted communications advisers to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- have either been fired or resigned. The pandemonium belies Trump's tweet earlier this month that boasted "no chaos, only great energy" inside the West Wing. "The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House," Trump wrote.  Hours after his boss, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, was ousted Steve Goldstein, the undersecretary of public affairs at the State Department, has been fired by the White House. Goldstein publicly contradicted the White House account of how Tillerson was fired on Tuesday morning. Goldstein said Tillerson was officially notified he'd been fired from a tweet from President Donald Trump on Tuesday morning, and in a statement, said Tillerson had "every intention of remaining." A senior administration official said Trump asked Tillerson to step aside on Friday and a senior White House official later clarified that chief of staff John Kelly told Tillerson that he would be replaced, but did not specify the timing.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson thanked the American people, his State Department staff and the nation's extensive network of diplomats in an at times emotional farewell statement on Tuesday. One person he did not thank: President Donald Trump, the man who nominated him for the job but abruptly told the world of his ouster in a tweet on Tuesday morning. The only mention of Trump came at the top of the statement when Tillerson mentioned that the President had called him at "a little after noontime from Air Force One" to talk about his ouster. That call came hours after Trump told the world he was replacing the former oil tycoon with CIA Director Mike Pompeo.
