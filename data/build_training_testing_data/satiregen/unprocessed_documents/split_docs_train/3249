 Kelly Sadler, the White House communications aide who made an imprudent comment about Republican Sen. John McCain's health, was quietly let go Tuesday nearly a month after making the insensitive remark. "Kelly Sadler is no longer employed within the Executive Office of the President," wrote Raj Shah, the principal deputy press secretary, in an emailed statement. The White House had been strategizing an exit for Sadler for the last two weeks, a senior administration official said. There had been a discussion about relocating her to another agency or department outside of the White House, and it remains unclear if she is going somewhere else or leaving the administration entirely.  The White House on Thursday condemned comedian Samantha Bee's remark that White House senior adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump is a "feckless c***," calling on TBS, which airs her show, to publicly repudiate her. The comment -- for which Bee later apologized Thursday -- comes in the wake of a national debate about incendiary language in the political arena. Earlier this week, Roseanne Barr's hit television show was abruptly canceled after she made a racist reference on Twitter to former Obama administration adviser Valerie Jarrett. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Bee's language was "vile and vicious."  White House press secretary Sarah Sanders refused again on Tuesday to correct her August statement that President Donald Trump wasn't involved in drafting a misleading statement about his son's meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower. "I'm not going to go into detail and go into a back-and-forth. I know that you guys would love to engage on matters of conversations between the special counsel and the outside counsel, but we purposefully" remain separate from special counsel matters, Sanders said when pressed by CNN's Pamela Brown. A day earlier, Sanders referred questions on the matter to the President's outside counsel.
