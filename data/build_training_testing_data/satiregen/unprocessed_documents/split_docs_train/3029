Genevieve goes for an audition for a regular singing job at a jazz club after she sent them a tape of her singing. However, when she returns, she tells Toadie that the club did not hire her as her image was not right for them. Toadie offers to help her sue them, but Genevieve is not keen on the idea of being a poster girl for over-sized women. Toadie convinces her that if they won, it would be worth it and she decides to go along with the plan. James Hayes (Patrick Brammall) is a small town policeman in Yoorana, Victoria. He is called to the local cemetery in the middle of the night after seven people have risen from the dead in perfect health but with no memory of their identities. They are determined to discover who they are and what has happened to them. James struggles to keep the case hidden from his colleagues, his family, and the world, with the help of local doctor Elishia McKellar (Genevieve O'Reilly). After having an operation on his brain tumour, Julien Baptiste claims he is not the man he once was. His old boss persuades him to help the Dutch Police look for a missing sex worker in Amsterdam.
