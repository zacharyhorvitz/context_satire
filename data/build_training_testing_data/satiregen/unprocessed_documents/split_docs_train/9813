The first institute of higher education in Butte was the Montana School of Mines, which was established in 1889, the year of Montana's statehood.

Montana State University offers the world's only Master of Fine Arts degree in Science and Natural History Filmmaking, and MSU's Museum of the Rockies is home to the largest T.

It became part of the Montana University System in 2000, and is titled University of Montana Western.
