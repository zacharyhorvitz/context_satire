Blackjack and backgammon came with the TRS-80 for free, and at its debut RadioShack offered four payroll, personal finance, and educational programs, all on cassette. :3 The more than 2,000 RadioShack franchise stores as of SeptemberÂ 1982 sold third-party hardware and software, but the more than 4,300 company-owned stores were at first prohibited from reselling or even mentioning products not sold by RadioShack itself. Its own products' quality was often poor. A critical 1980 80 Micro review of a text adventure described it as "yet another example of RadioShack's inability to deal with the consumer in a consumer's market". From the 1960s until the early 1990s, Radio Shack promoted a "battery of the month" club; a free wallet-sized cardboard card offered one free Enercell a month in-store. Like the free tube testing offered in-store in the early 1970s, this small loss leader drew foot traffic. The cards also served as generic business cards for the salespeople. The company was started as Radio Shack in 1921 by two brothers, Theodore and Milton Deutschmann, who wanted to provide equipment for the then-nascent field of amateur, or ham radio. The brothers opened a one-store retail and mail-order operation in the heart of downtown Boston at 46 Brattle Street. They chose the name "Radio Shack", which was the term for a small, wooden structure that housed a ship's radio equipment. The Deutschmanns thought the name was appropriate for a store that would supply the needs of radio officers aboard ships, as well as hams (amateur radio operators).
