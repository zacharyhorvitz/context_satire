 Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has doubled down on defending his company's decision not to kick far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones off its platform. "We didn't suspend Alex Jones or Infowars yesterday," Dorsey tweeted Tuesday. "We know that's hard for many but the reason is simple: he hasn't violated our rules. We'll enforce if he does.  YouTube, Facebook and Apple have taken steps to remove content associated with InfoWars and its founder Alex Jones. Each social media platform said Monday that it had removed content from Jones or InfoWars because it had violated their policies. The companies' moves shut down key distribution channels that had given the controversial media figure easy access to millions of internet users. The most dramatic action came last, from YouTube, which is owned by Google.  Twitter's vice president for trust and safety, Del Harvey, told employees in an email on Wednesday that if far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his fringe media organization InfoWars had posted to Twitter the same content that led YouTube and Facebook to take action against Jones and InfoWars, Twitter would have done something too. "It's worth noting that at least some of the content Alex Jones published on other platforms (e.g., Facebook and YouTube) that led to them taking enforcement against him would have also violated our policies had he posted it on Twitter," Harvey wrote. "Had he done so, we would have taken action against him as well." But a CNN review of Jones' accounts show that all of the videos that initially led the other tech companies to take action against Jones were in fact posted to Twitter by Jones or InfoWars.
