"I Ain't Living Long Like This" is a song written by Rodney Crowell that was first recorded by Gary Stewart on his 1977 album Your Place or Mine (with Rodney Crowell and Nicolette Larson on backing vocals). Emmylou Harris then recorded the song  for her 1978 album, Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town. Crowell released his version as well in 1978 on his debut album Ain't Living Long Like This. Following an appearance on the 1980 Rodney Crowell album But What Will the Neighbors Think, on which composer DeVito played guitar, "Queen of Hearts" had its highest-profile incarnation in a version by country-rock singer Juice Newton from the 1981 album Juice. Newton would later recall: "I did  live for about a year...Then I brought it to  Richard Landis when we started the Juice album. He wasn’t convinced at that point that it was a breakout song but I told him I think this is a real cool song … so we cut it." Newton's own favorite cut on the Juice album, "Queen of Hearts" was issued as the album's second single and would reach No. Rhodes joined Rodney Crowell, Steuart Smith, Eddie Bayers, and Vince Santoro in the Cicadas. They recorded one album in 1997, but had been playing together for more than a decade. Rhodes was also a member of The Notorious Cherry Bombs, with Crowell, Bayers, Vince Gill, Hank DeVito, and Richard Bennett.
