FiveThirtyEight, sometimes rendered as 538, is a website that focuses on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging. The website, which takes its name from the number of electors in the United States electoral college, was founded on March 7, 2008 as a polling aggregation website with a blog created by analyst Nate Silver. In August 2010, the blog became a licensed feature of The New York Times online. It was renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus.  Political polarization has gone from a polling data point to a punch line since the 2016 election. In this, the first major election since President Donald Trump came to power, the midterm elections are, to many experts, shaping up to be more than the names that appear on the ballots. At the heart of it, the midterms will likely be, at least in part, a way for voters to say: "This is the kind of America I want." CNN Opinion asked a diverse group of thinkers to weigh in.  CNN's live coverage of the 2018 midterm elections has concluded. Democrats on Tuesday captured the House of Representatives and are set to exert a major institutional check on President Trump, while breaking the Republican monopoly on power and ushering in a younger, more female and more racially diverse political generation. But the GOP solidified their Senate majority after an acerbic midterm election that enshrined America's deep divides and shaped a highly contentious battleground for the stirring 2020 presidential race. Stick with CNN Politics as we sort through the changed political landscape.
