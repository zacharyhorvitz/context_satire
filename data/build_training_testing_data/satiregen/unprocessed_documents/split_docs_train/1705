While Rebecca struggles with acceptance of her need to take anti-depressants, Dr. Akopian shows her that taking medication is completely normal. Meanwhile, at the hospital Paula continues to practice for the bar exam despite still being in recovery and Darryl bonds with a woman named April over bean dip. In the waiting room  Josh, Nathaniel, and Greg get exposed to squirrel flu after being coughed on by a young boy and are taken to an isolated ward. Due to a delay, Dr. Roth can't sign Paula out on time to take her bar exam, so Rebecca dresses up as a doctor to get a gurney and sneak Paula out of the hospital. On Valentine's Day, following dates with Josh, Nathaniel, and Greg, Rebecca has a dream in which she reunites with Dr. Akopian as a dream ghost who shows her different possible futures depending on who she chooses. While she appears happy in each of them, after the 'dreams' finish she becomes sad. After waking up, she tells Paula about the dream, and enters into one of her musical fantasies. Afterwards, she tells Paula about the musical numbers that take place in her head. Rebecca returns to work and, although Nathaniel is avoiding her, she aces a meeting with one of the firm's biggest clients. Still feeling dissatisfied, Dr. Akopian tells Rebecca that she doesn’t have to be a lawyer if she doesn’t enjoy it. Rebecca runs into Josh in the waiting room, as he now sees the other Dr. Akopian for therapy, and Josh tells Rebecca that he’s started dating again. She helps him pick out dates, but neither are successful.
