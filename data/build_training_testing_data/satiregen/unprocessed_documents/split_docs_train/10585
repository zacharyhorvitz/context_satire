Geisse developed the concept of upscale discount retailing while working for the Dayton Company. Using his concepts, the company opened its first Target discount store on May 1, 1962 in the Saint Paul suburb of Roseville, Minnesota; Douglas Dayton was its first president. The name "Target" originated from publicity director Stewart K. Widdess, and was intended to prevent consumers from associating the discount store with the department store. It opened three additional units in the first year, and reported its first gain in 1965 with sales reaching $39 million.
