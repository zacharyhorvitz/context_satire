 President Donald Trump told special counsel Robert Mueller in writing that Roger Stone did not tell him about WikiLeaks, nor was he told about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between his son, campaign officials and a Russian lawyer promising dirt on Hillary Clinton, according to two sources familiar with the matter. One source described the President's answers without providing any direct quotes and said the President made clear he was answering to the best of his recollection. This is the first insight into how the President responded to the Mueller team's written questions -- a key unknown as Mueller aims to wrap up his investigation and prepare his final report. These two points -- WikiLeaks and the Trump Tower meeting -- are critical to Mueller's central mission: investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians during the 2016 campaign.  Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has denied ever meeting Julian Assange, following a report he had met with the WikiLeaks founder at least three times in previous years. On Tuesday, The Guardian reported that Manafort had secretly met several times with Assange inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, including around the time he was made a top figure in the Trump campaign. The Guardian, citing sources, said Manafort had met with Assange in 2013, 2015 and in the spring of 2016. Manafort responded to The Guardian's report by calling it "totally false and deliberately libelous."  President Donald Trump declined in a new interview to rule out the possibility that he could pardon Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman. "It was never discussed, but I wouldn't take it off the table. Why would I take it off the table?" Trump told the New York Post.
