When Terrell went back to the same Head Start class he was in prior to the assault, Bryant, his teacher, noticed he was not walking normally. When she took off his sneakers she noticed that the flesh on the soles of both his feet had been burned off. This was again alleged, posthumously, to have been inflicted by Peterson as retribution for telling authorities about her previous assaults. The burns were severe enough to necessitate skin grafts, the skin was taken from his hips and transplanted onto the soles of his feet. Terrell was born on 4 April 1939 in Inverness, Mississippi, and spent his early childhood in Belzoni. He was born into a family of ten children, whose father was a Mississippi sharecroper, who during Terrell's childhood moved the family North to Chicago when he found employment in the factories there. Terrell received his formal education at Farragut School in Chicago. Before turning professional, he won the Chicago Golden Gloves in his youth as a light heavy-weight, and he also formed a pop music singing act called "The Heavyeights" with 3 of his siblings. To prepare for the role, he worked with a dialect coach and watched Obama's speeches to master his accent and manner of speaking, and was offered the part after one audition. He also trained himself to portray the left-handed Obama, including learning how to write and play basketball with his left hand. He read Obama's book Dreams from My Father three times to get into his mindset, and he received praise for his portrayal when the film was released.
