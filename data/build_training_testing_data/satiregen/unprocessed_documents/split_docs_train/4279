In 1973, Rivers co-wrote the made-for-television movie The Girl Most Likely To..., a black comedy starring Stockard Channing as an ugly girl who becomes beautiful after undergoing plastic surgery, and takes revenge on people who previously mistreated her. The film, based on Rivers' story, became a ratings success and has been considered a "cult classic".

The documentary found commercial success in its limited release and was acclaimed by critics for providing "an honest, behind-the-scenes look at ' career â€” and at show business in general". Beginning on September 10, 2010, Rivers co-hosted the E!
