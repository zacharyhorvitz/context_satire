As they travel together, Ryan – who has always rejected Graham as a grandfather figure – warms to him and their relationship improves. In "It Takes You Away", Graham is confronted by the apparent return of Grace while trapped in a mirror dimension. Despite the Doctor's pleas for Graham to recognise that Grace has been created by an alien force to tempt him away from the real world, he struggles to reject her; however, he comes to recognise her as an imposter when she is seemingly indifferent to the fact that Ryan was in peril. After they escape, Ryan calls Graham "Grandad" for the first time.  Watergate had the Saturday Night Massacre. Now, this generation's White House scandal has its own iconic moment — the Saturday Morning Meltdown. The firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe in the pitch dark of a Washington night unleashed a sudden chain of barely believable consequences and revelations in a frenzied few hours on Saturday. The capital reverberated with claims by McCabe that President Donald Trump orchestrated his ouster to cover up his own obstruction of justice.  As President Donald Trump's reaction to special counsel Robert Mueller grows more irate by the day, attorneys on both sides sat down last week in a rare face-to-face discussion about the topics investigators could inquire of the President. It was the first in-person meeting after several weeks of informal discussions between the two sides, according to two sources familiar with the talks. Mueller's team added granularity to the topics it originally discussed with the defense team months ago, like the firing of FBI Director James Comey, according to one of the sources. This time around, for instance, the prosecutors said they would ask about Attorney General Jeff Sessions' involvement in the Comey dismissal and what Trump knew about national security adviser Michael Flynn's phone calls with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in late December 2016.
