 As the massive Hurricane Florence barrels towards his state, North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr said Tuesday he is "confident" the White House is prepared to deal with the storm, following the President's remarkable praise of his administration's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year where the island's governor has put the death toll at nearly 3,000 people. "Listen, I'm not going to comment on any particular event," Burr told CNN when asked about Trump's positive comments about the Puerto Rico disaster. "I am going to tell you the cooperation and response that I have experienced with this FEMA versus any FEMA for the 25 years that I've been here has been exemplary." Burr said he was briefed Tuesday on the administration's preparations for the storm, which is expected to make landfall later this week.  President Donald Trump issued a strong warning to those in the path of Hurricane Florence, which is on track to hit the East Coast as a major storm later this week. "The Storms in the Atlantic are very dangerous. We encourage anyone in the path of these storms to prepare themselves and to heed the warnings of State and Local officials. The Federal Government is closely monitoring and ready to assist.  Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency insisted Wednesday that the transfer of nearly $10 million of its budget to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement will not affect the agency's hurricane response and other disaster relief efforts. "We have plenty of resources, both monetary, staff and commodities, to respond to the storm," Jeff Byard, FEMA's associate administrator for the Office and Response and Recovery, told reporters during a morning briefing as Hurricane Florence barreled toward the Carolina coast. "We have plenty of resources to respond, plenty of resources to recover. That has not impacted our situation whatsoever."
