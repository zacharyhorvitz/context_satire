 Less than an hour before her husband died, Nicole Suiter remembers joking with him about a video she took of the Baltimore police detective dancing. Sean Suiter was in a great mood, Nicole Suiter said. He was hardly a man preparing to take his own life. In her first public comments since her husband's death, Nicole Suiter said a recently released report concluding that Sean Suiter committed suicide is "outlandish." Baltimore ( BAWL-tim-or, locally: ) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Maryland, as well as the 30th most populous city in the United States, with a population of 602,495 in 2018 and also the largest such independent city in the country. Baltimore was established by the Constitution of Maryland as an independent city in 1729. As of 2017, the population of the Baltimore metropolitan area was estimated to be just under 2.802 million, making it the 21st largest metropolitan area in the country. Baltimore is located about 40 miles (64 km) northeast of Washington, D.C., making it a principal city in the Washington-Baltimore combined statistical area (CSA), the fourth-largest CSA in the nation, with a calculated 2018 population of 9,797,063.The city's Inner Harbor was once the second leading port of entry for immigrants to the United States.  A Baltimore police detective who officials initially said was fatally shot in a struggle with a suspect actually took his own life with his service weapon, according to an independent report released Tuesday. Sean Suiter, 43, was shot in the head with his own gun November 15 in a vacant lot in West Baltimore, police said. The fatal shooting occurred the day before Suiter, a homicide detective, was scheduled to testify before a federal grand jury in a police corruption case involving fellow officers. Then-Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said at the time that a brief call Suiter made on his police radio occurred during a struggle with a killer.
