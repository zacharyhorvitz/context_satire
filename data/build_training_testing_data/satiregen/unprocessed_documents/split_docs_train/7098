 Police are searching for the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing this morning, identified by Boston police as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, age 19. The ongoing manhunt follows a violent night, during which Dzhokhar's older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a firefight with authorities in which the men allegedly hurled explosives at pursuers after killing a university police officer, robbing a convenience store and hijacking a car. According to a source briefed on the investigation, the suspects are originally from the Russian Caucasus and had moved to Kazakhstan at a young age before coming to the United States several years ago. Eric Machado went to high school with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the suspect who is still on the loose.  Investigators are tracking down some two-thousand leads this morning in their search for information regarding the Boston Marathon bombings. There are also new reports this morning that Boston-area hospitals have released at least 100 of the 183 people injured in Monday's attack. New details about the lives of the three people killed including a Chinese graduate student who was studying at Boston University are coming out as well. This morning Congressman Patrick Meehan (R-PA) joins “Starting Point.” Meehan serves as the chair of the House Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee and was briefed about the Boston Marathon bombing on Monday. On the afternoon of the bombing, the New York Post reported that a suspect, a Saudi Arabian male, was under guard and being questioned at a Boston hospital. That evening, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said that there had not been an arrest. The Post did not retract its story about the suspect, leading to widespread reports by CBS News, CNN, and other media that a Middle Eastern suspect was in custody. The day after the bombing, a majority of outlets were reporting that the Saudi was a witness, not a suspect.
