 As unrest in Baltimore again focuses attention on race relations in America, President Barack Obama plans to re-launch his My Brother's Keeper Initiative -- meant to address the opportunity deficit for minority youth -- as a non-profit organization. He'll travel to the Bronx on Monday to unveil the "My Brother's Keeper Alliance" at Lehman College, part of the City University of New York System. A job listing found online describes the organization as "in a startup phase" and "preparing for hyper-growth." Obama first announced the My Brother's Keeper program in 2014 as an attempt to reverse trends showing young men of color are more likely to drop out of school, get in trouble with the lawor be unemployed. After President Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice: "But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got." The Obama administration inherited a war in Afghanistan, a war in Iraq, and a global "War on Terror," all launched by Congress during the term of President Bush in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Upon taking office, Obama called for a "new beginning" in relations between the Muslim world and the United States, and he discontinued the use of the term "War on Terror" in favor of the term "Overseas Contingency Operation." Obama pursued a "light footprint" military strategy in the Middle East that emphasized special forces, drone strikes, and diplomacy over large ground troop occupations. However, American forces continued to clash with Islamic militant organizations such as al-Qaeda, ISIL, and al-Shabaab under the terms of the AUMF passed by Congress in 2001.
