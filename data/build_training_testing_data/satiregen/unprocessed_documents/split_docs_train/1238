Phillips went on to make a massive contribution to the Chairboys promotion from League Two in the 2008–09 season, becoming a regular on either the left or right wing, impressing with his ability to take on defenders and to cut inside. He was also won the club's two "Young Player of the Year" awards at the end of the season as well as the League Two "Apprentice of the Year". Phillips was given the number 18 shirt for the 2009–10 season and continued his good form from the previous season, playing on either flank. In total, Phillips made 87 league and cup appearances for Wycombe, scoring nine goals. In late 2008, Baldwin formed a for-profit organization called Antioch Ministry, which exists "to facilitate the gifts and calling of Stephen Baldwin". In 2009, Baldwin and Southern launched a third ministry called Now More Than Ever, designed to reach enlisted men and women in the military around the world. In 2008, Baldwin teamed up with conservative talk-radio host Kevin McCullough to put together a Saturday radio show called Baldwin/McCullough Radio. As of April 18, 2009, the show aired on 213 stations and in more than 400 cities across the US, and worldwide on Sirius 161 and XM 227. Stephen Baldwin said on The Today Show he was brought in to help develop the character and then was given the role.
