 About four in 10 Americans say North Korea is an immediate threat to the US in the wake of the nation's recently stepped-up attempts to posture itself as a military threat to the US and others, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. In the poll released Thursday, about 37% of respondents consider North Korea an immediate threat to the security of the US. The  new CNN/ORC poll was released in the same week that President Donald Trump summoned the full Senate to the White House for a briefing on the North Korean threat. Trump told Reuters on Thursday that although he would prefer a diplomatic solution to the threat of nuclear proliferation in North Korea, he believes "there is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea.  President Trump keeps pushing "Buy American." He's planning to tout it again at a stop in Wisconsin on Tuesday. But the alarming reality is Americans aren't spending much money on anything right now, regardless of where it's made. Retail sales declined in February and March from the prior month, according the Commerce Department.  President Trump wants to bring jobs back to America, and he believes NAFTA is holding him back. On Thursday, Trump tweeted that he would "terminate NAFTA" if he couldn't reach a fair deal. A day earlier, he agreed to renegotiate the free trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada. He has called NAFTA the worst trade deal in history and blames it for the loss of millions of US manufacturing jobs to Mexico, even though congressional nonpartisan research found that not to be true.
