Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Harris was raised in rural Bonita Springs in southwest Florida, where her naturalist parents taught her how to identify the state's native flora and fauna. In 1936, she received a bachelor's degree in zoology from Florida State College for Women, the present-day Florida State University. Denied funding and/or admission to graduate programs in zoology and ornithology due to her gender, Harris took a position as the nation's first female wildlife technician shortly after completing her undergraduate degree. In 1942, with the assistance of her husband, pioneering conservation biologist Archie Carr, Marjorie Harris Carr completed a master's in zoology at the University of Florida, which was still officially an all-male institution. Archie Fairly Carr, Jr. (June 16, 1909 – May 21, 1987) was an American herpetologist, ecologist and a pioneering conservationist. He was a Professor of Zoology at the University of Florida. In 1987 he was awarded the Eminent Ecologist Award by the Ecological Society of America. He made extraordinary contribution to sea turtle conservation by way of bringing attention to the world's declining turtle populations due to over-exploitation and loss of safe habitat.
