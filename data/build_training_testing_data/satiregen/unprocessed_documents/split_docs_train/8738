 NATO and U.S. forces are seeing a marked increase in infiltration into Afghanistan from Pakistan by the militant Haqqani network, a senior NATO official said Tuesday. There has been a significant increase in the Haqqani network's activity in Khost, Paktia, Logar and Wardak provinces which are used in that order as an infiltration route from Pakistan, to launch attacks on the capital, the official said. The senior NATO official spoke to reporters in Kabul on the condition no name was used. Whether or not NATO and the United States will have to provide more assistance to the Afghan security forces, particularly along the border with Pakistan, will depend on "the level of threat coming out of Miramshah" in North Waziristan, the official said.  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Afghanistan on an unannounced visit Wednesday, just one day after landing in Libya. She is to meet with Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Thursday and hopes to show the United States' commitment to Afghanistan, the State Department said. Clinton is also expected to discuss the relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan. A day before, her trip to Tripoli was the first by a Cabinet-level American official since the ouster of longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi.  Amid the 1,200-page military investigation into the August crash in Afghanistan's Wardak province that killed 38 people, including 22 Navy SEALS, are photos of the helicopter. These are the first photos released by the military of the crash, which resulted in the biggest loss of life in a single day for the United States in the 10 years of fighting in Afghanistan. According to the report, the SEALs had been called in to reinforce other troops already in combat. Just before landing, Taliban fighters hiding in a building fired rocket-propelled grenades.
