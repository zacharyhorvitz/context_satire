 The bears have returned in China. The Shanghai Composite shed 6.2% on Tuesday, once again bringing the key index below the 3,800 point mark. The cause of the sell off was not immediately apparent, but it was a return to form for Chinese markets, which have been rocked by volatile trading sessions for most of the summer. Beijing managed to stabilize equities with a dramatic rescue in late June and early July, intervening in a number of ways to limit losses for investors.  It's a stock market crash that just won't stop. Almost 10 weeks into a hot and troubled summer and the Shanghai market has taken another lurch downwards -- it has now lost nearly 40% of its value from its peak on June 12. But this time the sell-off is not an isolated incident in global stock markets. The latest Shanghai slump comes as the rest of the world starts to worry about the state of China's economy.  Chinese investors again experienced a roller coaster ride on Tuesday. After the Shanghai Composite tanked by more than 8% yesterday, earning it the nickname 'Black Monday', the index dropped sharply again for a second straight day, falling by over 7%. That puts the index a whopping 42% from its peak in June. Faced with this new rout, local investors -- many of who are still reeling from the meltdown that began in June -- posted reactions across Chinese social media ranging from dark humor and despair to a revealing mistrust of the government.
