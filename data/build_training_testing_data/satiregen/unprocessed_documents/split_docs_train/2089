 Donald Trump is going to make a decision "very soon" regarding a third-party run, he said Saturday. "As far as a third-party run is concerned, the Republican Party has been treating me very, very fairly. All I ask is fairness," he told reporters after addressing the and addressed the National Federation of Republican Assemblies in Nashville, Tennessee. "In terms of victory, that would certainly be the best path to victory, and we're gonna make a decision very soon and I think a lot of people are gonna be very happy."  Donald Trump has signed the pledge. The Republican presidential front-runner met privately with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus Thursday afternoon, and soon after, came out to the lobby of Trump Tower to declare that he has signed a loyalty pledge. This means Trump has promised to support the party's eventual nominee -- whoever that may be -- and that he will not run as a third-party candidate. "The best way for the Republicans to win is if I win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up.  Republican leaders must be overjoyed! Donald Trump has signed the "loyalty pledge" vowing that he will support the Republican nominee in 2016. I can understand why they are probably crazily high-fiving each other now. After all, polls have shown that if Trump did run as an independent presidential candidate in 2016, he would likely siphon off votes from the GOP nominee and serve up a big, fat victory for the Democrats.
