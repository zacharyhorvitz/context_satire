Beginning in 1973, Domino's Pizza offered a guarantee to customers their pizzas would be delivered within 30 minutes of placing an order or they would receive the pizzas free. This guarantee was changed to $3 off in the mid-1980s. In 1992, the company settled a lawsuit brought by the family of an Indiana woman who had been killed by a speeding Domino's delivery driver, paying the family $2.8 million. In another 1993 lawsuit, brought by a woman who was injured when a Domino's delivery driver ran a red light and collided with her vehicle. The largest market for Sarpino's USA is in and around Chicago; however, the company also operates in several other markets around the United States.
