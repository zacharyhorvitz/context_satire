This address will mark the fourth time he delivers a speech at the UNGA podium at which he is expected to address the violent protests in the Middle East that resulted in the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others. President Obama will also be using his speech to reaffirm U.S. support for Israel and restate the position that Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.  On Friday, President Obama is expected to make a very important phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The phone call follows a week of heavy criticism against the president for not meeting with Netanyahu in person and yet making time for several TV appearances and campaign stops. Thursday, the Israeli Prime Minister met with Secretary Of State Hillary Clinton for more than an hour, which included an "in depth discussion on Iran." That meeting followed Netanyahu’s blistering speech to the United Nations General Assembly where he made it clear Israel would demand a "red line" to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon -- literally drawing that line in front of the audience.
