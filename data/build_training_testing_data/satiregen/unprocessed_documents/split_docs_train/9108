 No one -- not Bernie Sanders, not Elizabeth Warren, not Pete Buttigieg, not anyone -- has more riding on tonight's CNN Democratic presidential debate than Beto O'Rourke. The former Texas congressman entered the 2020 race to a huge amount of fanfare (and money; $6 million raised in his first day as a candidate). But since then, not much of anything. O'Rourke has looked genuinely lost in the race over the last few months, a sense typified by his barely there performance in the first debates of the presidential contest last month.  The first of two CNN-sponsored Democratic presidential debates is over. I watched -- from the debate site in Detroit -- and jotted down some of the best and worst performances from the 10 candidates on stage. My picks of the winners and losers from Tuesday night's debate (in no particular order) are below. WINNERS *Bernie Sanders: The Vermont senator clearly got the message that he wasn't lively or active enough in the first debate of the cycle.  With 190 days until the Iowa caucuses and a make-or-break debate just days away, expect the 2020 candidates to come out swinging this week. Every Sunday, I round up the 5 BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail. And they're ranked -- so No. 1 is the most important.
