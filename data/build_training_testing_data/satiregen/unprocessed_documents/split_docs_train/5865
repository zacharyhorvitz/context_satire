The Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award is presented to the ensemble cast, director and casting director of a film by the Film Independent, a non-profit organization dedicated to independent film and independent filmmakers. It is named after director, screenwriter, and producer Robert Altman, who is considered a "maverick" in naturalistic films. In 2004, Altman served as director of Photography on director Robert Altman and writer/cartoonist Garry Trudeau's Tanner on Tanner. Premiering at the Sundance Film Festival, the film was a follow-up to their documentary-style Emmy-winning film, Tanner '88. The new "Tanner", a four-part series following the new adventures of fictional presidential nominee Tanner, was filmed to coincide with the Bush-Kerry elections. Robert Bernard Altman (/ˈɔːltmən/; February 20, 1925 – November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era, Altman was considered a "maverick" in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized  and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema.
