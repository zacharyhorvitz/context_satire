Arriving at the Justice of the Peace, their wedding has to be delayed as state law requires the couple to post banns of marriage in the local newspaper for three days prior to the wedding. Returning to their own town, David prepares the banns to be published as soon as possible and goes to the local town hall to obtain his birth certificate for his government posting. The clerks discover that due to the fathers of Bob and David fighting when the children were born, the two infants were mixed at the hospital with David being a Harrison and Bob being a Conway. Not only is Carol set to marry her brother, but the intention to do so faces a fifteen year prison sentence. Toward the end of his life, he lived in a two-story house across from a golf course in Coronado, California, attended by an aide and housekeeper. He died of cardiac failure while being treated for a hip fracture at Balboa Naval Hospital in San Diego, California at the age of 105. At the time of his death, he was the oldest military officer in the United States. Like Romeo and Juliet, next door neighbours David Conway and Carol Harrison are deeply in love with each other though their fathers have been feuding for a lifetime. With David due to go to the Alaskan Territory for engineering work for the United States Government, the pair decide to elope. David gets his best friend, Carol's brother Bob to witness their wedding at a Justice of the Peace in a neighbouring town using Millie, who has an infatuation with Bob to drive them to the town in her car and act as another witness.
