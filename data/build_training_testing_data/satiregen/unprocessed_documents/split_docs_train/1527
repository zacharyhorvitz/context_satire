While waiting outside, the police questioned Bamber, who they said seemed calm. According to the Court of Appeal, Bamber told them about the phone call from his father and that it had sounded as though someone had cut off the call. He said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: "I don't really know. At some point Constable West spoke to Bamber again on the telephone; Bamber apparently complained about the time the police were taking, saying: "When my father rang he sounded terrified." He was told to go to the farm and wait for the police. Explaining why he had called a local police station and not 999, Bamber told police on the night that he had not thought it would make a difference to how soon they would arrive. He said he had spent time looking up the number, and even though his father had asked him to come quickly, he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London, then had driven slowly to the farmhouse.

But I am speaking to the vast majority of the American people, as well as to the press. We do not have time for this kind of silliness. We've got better stuff to do."
