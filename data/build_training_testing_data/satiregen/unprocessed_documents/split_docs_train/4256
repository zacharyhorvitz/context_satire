The rise of the middle class in Chinese society is one reality behind China's escalating cosmetic surgery industry. The increase in the  purchasing power of over 350 million Chinese raised the level of people's standards of living allowing them to aspire for other luxuries and life standards. Based on statistics culled from the Chinese Association of Plastics and Aesthetics in November 2015, the country's plastic surgery sector has grown rapidly with an annual growth rate of 30%. Likewise, it has changed the definition of plastic surgery. Noёl developed an interest in cosmetic surgery when she saw that the American actress Sara Bernhardt, who was over sixty years in age, had returned from a trip "looking rather rejuvenated" in 1912. Noёl began to experiment with pinching her skin to see if she could acquire the same effect. She later moved to experimenting on anaesthetized rabbits. When she started her practice in 1916, Noël was allowed to treat wounded soldiers for facial surgeries during World War I. She was awarded the Legion of Honor from the Foreign Office for being a "doctor of unusual skill." This was a stepping stone for all female surgeons as it was a time when women were struggling to get a foothold in the medical field. Noёl also believed in a woman’s right to vote; she even compared a woman's right to vote to their right to change an "ugly face" or "humiliating body." She believed that every woman should be able to have a youthful appearance and be able to choose their own destiny as they see fit.
