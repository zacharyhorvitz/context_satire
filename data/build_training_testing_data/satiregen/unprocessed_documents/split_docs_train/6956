Presidents use Oval Office addresses as a way to directly communicate with the American people. It is considered to be a major address and it functions as a way to move public opinion by having a direct connection with the President of the United States. Presidential historian, Robert Dallek stated, “The Oval Office invokes the center of the presidential authority. That's the president's office, that's where he supposedly makes decisions, where he governs.” The tone of the speech is set when Presidents decide to make a speech in the Oval Office. Traditionally, the addresses are delivered with the President sitting at the Resolute desk speaking into the camera. Occasionally, however, the President will stand at a lectern on the opposite side of the Oval Office and give the address. Previously, it was also common for an artificial background to be placed behind the President, ordinarily consisting of plain blue fabric. Since the administration of Jimmy Carter, the preference has instead been for the natural backdrop of the Office's windows.  President Donald Trump held a ceremony on Friday at the White House for the Louisiana State University football team to celebrate their recent national championship game win. "It is really my great privilege to welcome to the White House the college football national champions, the Louisiana State University Tigers," Trump said during an East Room ceremony filled with players, team staff, administration officials, members of Congress and fans. "This team showed the world what it means to look out for one another." Trump went nearly the entire ceremony without bringing up impeachment, until he invited members of the team to take pictures in the Oval Office behind the Resolute Desk.
