The controversy pitted individual loggers and small sawmill owners against environmentalists. Bumper stickers reading Kill a Spotted Owl—Save a Logger and I Like Spotted Owls—Fried appeared to support the loggers. Plastic spotted owls were hung in effigy in Oregon sawmills. The logging industry, in response to continued bad publicity, started the Sustainable Forestry Initiative. Per Greenpeace, there are anywhere between 54-62 villages who depend on the forest for their lively hood, additionally, the Mahan forests, that the mining company plans to destroy by cutting down over 500,000 trees, houses hundreds of migratory bird species and wildlife. The project was first floated in 2006 and rejected in 2011, by the then Environment Minister who cited following reasons of his rejection: "It is an undoubtedly biodiversity rich area. It will destroy good natural forest cover and interfere with wildlife habitats". He further added that "by the companies’ own admission, the coal mined from this area will only last for the next 14 years and therefore he does not find the proposal reasonable". The northern spotted owl and Mexican spotted owl subspecies are listed as threatened in the United States under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The California spotted owl is not considered to be threatened nor endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). However, it is a species of special concern by the state of California and the United States Forest Service.
