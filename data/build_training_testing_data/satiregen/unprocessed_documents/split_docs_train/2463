Cornyn has long opposed anyone profiting from memorabilia tied to convicted murderers, and has made three attempts to pass laws against it. He introduced his first "Stop the Sale of Murderabilia to Protect the Dignity of Crime Victims Act" in 2007, which died in committee. He revived it three years later with cosponsor Amy Klobuchar. The 2010 version of the "Murderabilia" bill met the same fate. As of February 2020, there are three living former senators. The most recent senator to die was Lloyd Bentsen (served 1971–1993) on May 23, 2006, who is also the most recently serving senator to die.
