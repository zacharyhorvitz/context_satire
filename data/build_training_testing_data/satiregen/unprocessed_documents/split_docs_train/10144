Roberto Soldić also decided to pursue his career in the professional boxing ring. He made his professional boxing debut on April 2, 2016 at a local boxing manifestation in Düsseldorf, Germany, in light heavyweight division. He defeated Goran Ristić via KO in the first round. Roberto Soldić suffered his first professional setback at MFC 3: Montenegro Fighting Championship 3, that took place in Budva, Montenegro, July 27, 2015. He lost to Marko Radaković via unanimous decision. After two rounds, judges decided in favor of the local fighter which caused a lot of upset in the regional MMA circles and media which claimed that Soldić scored more points. His coaches also revealed to the media that the organizers made last-minute changes to the rules, since the match was initially set for three rounds. In December 2017, just two months after his big win in the match against Lewis Long, Roberto Soldić stepped into the cage for the fifth time in one year in Polish MMA promotion Konfrontacja Sztuk Walki (KSW). By stepping up on ten days’ notice and accepting welterweight title bout, Soldić decided to take the biggest test in his professional career. His opponent was experienced champion Borys Mankowski. Mankowski’s original opponent Dricus du Plessis from South Africa was forced to withdraw from the match quoting an injury.
