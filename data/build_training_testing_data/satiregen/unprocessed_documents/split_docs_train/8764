In the present, Mrs Munro gradually becomes dissatisfied with her work, as Holmes's overall health deteriorates and he spends more time with her son. After he becomes unconscious from an experiment with the prickly ash, he requires more nursing care. Mrs Munro accepts a job at a hotel in Portsmouth, planning to take Roger to work there as well. Roger does not want to go, feeling attached to Holmes and being unhappy with his barely literate mother and his family's working-class status, thus tension develops between mother and son. Holmes was romantically involved with technology entrepreneur Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani, a Pakistani-born Hindu who immigrated to India and then the US. She met him in 2002 at age 18, while still in school; he was 19 years older than her and married to another woman at the time. Balwani divorced his wife in 2002 and became romantically involved with Holmes in 2003, about the same time Holmes dropped out of college, and the couple moved into an apartment around 2005. Although Balwani did not officially join the company until 2009, as chief operating officer, he was advising Holmes behind the scenes before then. Except for that of Watson, Holmes avoids casual company. In "The Gloria Scott", he tells the doctor that during two years at college he made only one friend: "I was never a very sociable fellow, Watson ... I never mixed much with the men of my year".
