 A heck of a lot more Americans were toking up in 2012-13 than 10 years before -- and not for medical reasons, either -- according to a new study. The percentage of American adults who had used marijuana within the last year was 9.5%, the study found. That compared to 4.1% in 2001-02. The study -- published this week in Jama Psychiatry, a monthly journal published by the American Medical Association -- was sponsored by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.  The impending trial of the Baltimore police involved in the death of Freddie Gray extends the saga of one of the city's "lead kids," who suffered the consequences of growing up in a community polluted by lead paint. This past summer, in east central Los Angeles, researchers discovered that a lead smelter has contaminated up to 10,000 homes, leaving the yards so polluted they are potentially unsafe for child's play. Still more recently, high lead levels turned up among children living around a former lead factory in Philadelphia. Together, these stories testify to how America's problems with lead continue to fester, even as we consume just as much of the toxic metal as 50 years ago.  The number of American gazillionaires is on the rise. Some 134 people each took home more than $50 million in compensation from their jobs last year, according to newly released statistics from the Social Security Administration. That's up 110 people a year earlier. Most were high-level executives who left their jobs or retired, cashing in their hefty deferred compensation packages that built up over the years, said David Cay Johnston, who teaches at Syracuse College of Law.
