Chris Herzberger, executive at Live Theatricals at Universal Stage Productions, who developed the musical, said that, "I ask, 'Is it a great story, one that will move me, make me laugh or cry? And will it benefit from what is unique about theater, which is the live experience?'" Much of the film score was kept, with several songs omitted, including the minstrel number performed in blackface. The creators also requested songs from the Irving Berlin catalog. In Lakota mythology, Wi is one of the most powerful spirits. He is a solar spirit, and is associated with the American Bison. He is the father of Wóȟpe. Anog Ite attempted to seduce Wi, but she had one of her two faces changed into an ugly visage as punishment. The engine was built at Wright Aeronautical in Paterson, New Jersey by a 24-year-old engine builder, Tom Rutledge, who was disappointed that he was assigned to the unknown aviator, Lindbergh. Four days after the flight, he received a letter of congratulations from the Wright management.
