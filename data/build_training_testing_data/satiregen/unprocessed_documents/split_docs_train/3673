Silverman dated comedian and fellow SNL writer Dave Attell. Silverman began dating Jimmy Kimmel in 2002. She referred to the relationship in some of her comedy, joking: "I'm Jewish, but I wear this Saint Christopher medal sometimes; my boyfriend is Catholic – but you know ... it was cute the way he gave it to me. He said if it doesn't burn a hole through my skin, it will protect me." In June 2007, she hosted the MTV Movie Awards. During her opening act, she commented on the upcoming jail sentence of Paris Hilton, who was in the audience, saying: "In a couple of days, Paris Hilton is going to jail. As a matter of fact, I heard that to make her feel more comfortable in prison, the guards are going to paint the bars to look like penises. I think it is wrong, too.  It's the first (unofficial) week of summer, which means that a lot of us had Monday off. It means Congress had the whole week off. But that gave the Trump administration a chance to be this week's GIF star -- along with some pretty cute kids who attended White House events. President Donald Trump went to Tennessee for a rally on Tuesday.
