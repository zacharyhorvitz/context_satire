To determine the level of damage, the staff teams are prepared to systematically assess collections and exhibitions damage and provide remedies that will reduce recovery time. Small museum personnel teams consist of various combinations of registrar (museum), curators, conservators, and exhibition designers and art handlers. The teams are sorted by their involvement in either the type of collections on display or due to their participation on the initial exhibition team. If this is not known at the moment, off-site back-up information might need to be consulted. Museums will inevitably face an emergency situation either natural or man-made at some point and therefore will need to develop an emergency preparedness plan to mitigate risks to the collections objects and personnel within the museum. The primary objectives of emergency planning are to identify risks in order to anticipate and, if possible, to avoid emergencies; to retain control when an emergency occurs; and to mitigate potential damage as quickly as possible . When an emergency plan is created, various stake holders within the institution should be consulted and upon completion, the emergency plan should be recorded and made easily understood and easy to implement with copies of the plan kept in different locations within and outside of the museum. In case of an emergency at the museum, the plan may not be accessible and therefore a copy of the plan can be obtained at an outside location. As a first resort, the EMS provide treatment on the scene to those in need of urgent medical care. If it is deemed necessary, they are tasked with transferring the patient to the next point of care. This is most likely an emergency department of a hospital. Historically, ambulances only transported patients to care, and this remains the case in parts of the developing world.
