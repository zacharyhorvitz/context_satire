Edward Charles Sackville-West, 5th Baron Sackville (13 November 1901 – 4 July 1965) was a British music critic, novelist and, in his last years, a member of the House of Lords. Musically gifted as a boy, he was attracted as a young man to a literary life and wrote a series of semi-autobiographical novels in the 1920s and 1930s. They made little impact, and his more lasting books are a biography of the poet Thomas de Quincey and The Record Guide, Britain's first comprehensive guide to classical music on record, first published in 1951. As a critic and a member of the board of the Royal Opera House, he strove to promote the works of young British composers, including Benjamin Britten and Michael Tippett. Charles P. West (May 2, 1921 – October 7, 2015) was an American politician. Born on the family farm in Gumboro Hundred, Delaware, he served in the United States Army during World War II. West was a farmer and carpenter, and a member of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners. From 1957 to 1959 and then from 1977 to 2003, he served in the Delaware House of Representatives as a Democrat. The Pnakotic Manuscripts (or Pnakotic Fragments)  is a fictional manuscript in the Cthulhu Mythos. The tome was created by  H. P. Lovecraft and first appeared in his short story "Polaris" (1918). They are mentioned in many of Lovecraft's stories, including "The Other Gods" (1933), The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath (1926), The Whisperer in Darkness, At the Mountains of Madness (1936), "Through the Gates of the Silver Key", The Shadow Out of Time (1936) and "The Haunter of the Dark". The manuscripts are also referred to by other Mythos authors, such as Lin Carter and Brian Lumley.
