The AMA has one of the largest political lobbying budgets of any organization in the United States. Its political positions throughout its history have often been controversial. In the 1930s, the AMA attempted to prohibit its members from working for the health maintenance organizations established during the Great Depression, which violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and resulted in a conviction ultimately affirmed by the US Supreme Court. The American Medical Association's vehement campaign against Medicare in the 1950s and 1960s included Operation Coffee Cup, supported by Ronald Reagan.  The American Medical Association says the proposed mergers between four of the nation's largest health insurers will drive up costs for patients and hurt the quality of care. In a study released by the physicians' trade association, the AMA argues that insurance competition would be significantly reduced in 97 metropolitan areas spread across most states. It's calling for the mergers to be blocked. "A lack of competition in health insurer markets is not in the best interests of patients or physicians," said Dr. Steven Stack, the AMA's president, in a news release. AMIA is the official United States representative to the International Medical Informatics Association. It has grown to more than 5,000 members from 42 countries worldwide. Together, these members represent all basic, applied, and clinical interests in health care information technology. It publishes the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association.
