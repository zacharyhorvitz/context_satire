 Let's not play games or be "politically correct." Common sense tells us that the bombings Saturday in New York City and New Jersey were acts of terrorism. But too often these days, we don't hear the word terrorism used by the media or elected officials until they know that the perpetrators involved have some kind of international links. And we know what that means: Muslims.  The capture of bombings suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami alive gives investigators a rare opportunity to try to establish his motivations and affiliations -- if they can get him to talk. Law enforcement officials launched a manhunt for Rahami after identifying him through a fingerprint, and he was taken into custody Monday after a shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey. But questions remain about the events leading up to Saturday's bombings in New York and Seaside Park, New Jersey, and the discovery of pipe bombs Sunday night in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Did Rahami act alone?  Traders shrugged off the apparent terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. Stocks were largely flat in midday trading ... and it did not appear that there was any extra security added at the New York Stock Exchange. A spokesperson for the NYSE had no comment about whether or not it boosted security on Monday. The New York Police Department was not immediately available for comment.
