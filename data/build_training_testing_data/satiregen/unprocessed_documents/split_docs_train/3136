In December, a Monmouth University poll was released showing Cruz leading in Iowa at 24%. A CNN/ORC poll showed Cruz in second place to Trump among likely voters in the state's caucus with 20%. Though the polls were seen as contradicting each other and even causing Iowa to face the prospect of having two front-runners within the primary, Cruz was consistently seen by voters as a second choice to a Republican candidate that could win the general election, only behind Trump. On December 12, The Des Moines Register released a poll with Cruz leading Trump in Iowa by ten points at 31%.  Donald Trump is leading Marco Rubio in the Florida senator's home state by 8 percentage points, a Monmouth University poll out Monday shows. Trump has the support of 38% of Florida's likely GOP primary voters, compared to 30% who back Rubio, 17% for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and 10% for Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The snapshot of Florida comes before the state's crucial 99-delegate, winner-take-all primary set for March 15.  Donald Trump leads a bunched field of challengers by double digits in Illinois, according to a Chicago Tribune poll released Tuesday. Trump registered 32% support among Illinois Republicans in the Tribune poll, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in second place with 22%, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 21% and Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 18%. Trump's advantage over his GOP presidential primary rivals -- just a week ahead of the March 15 primary -- has him positioned to pad his lead with Illinois' 69 delegates up for grabs.
