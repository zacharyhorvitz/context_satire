After contacting her daughter Lee and Lee's boyfriend, Broderick turned herself in to police, never denying that she had indeed pulled the trigger five times. Broderick's explanation at both trials was that she had never planned to kill Dan and Linda and that her crime was not premeditated. Her account of the murders at her second trial was that she was startled by Linda's screaming, "Call the police!" and immediately fired the gun. In his youth, thirteen years her junior, the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a protégé of the French noblewoman Françoise-Louise de Warens, who would become his first lover. He lived with her at her estate on and off since his teenage years, and in 1732, after he reached the age of 20, she initiated a sexual relationship with him while also being open about her sexual involvement with the steward of her house. Tristan and Siegfried meet hobo, Roddy Travers, and his dog who are passing through the area. Mrs Hall has gone to Brawton to visit her sister, Dorothy, whose husband is sick and has been told he cannot return to work. Tristan reluctantly agrees to take over the household chores and duties in her absence. Siegfried is less than sympathetic when his brother starts to complain.
