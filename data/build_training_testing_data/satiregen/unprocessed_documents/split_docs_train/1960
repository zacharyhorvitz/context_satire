Truman High School  is a public high school located in Independence, Missouri, serving students in grades 9-12. It is named after hometown resident U.S. President Harry S Truman and his family. The mascot of Truman is a patriot, and the school's colors are red, white, and blue. Truman students are competitive with students from surrounding areas, but mostly towards William Chrisman, their cross-town rivals. Harry S. Truman High School is a public high school at 750 Baychester Avenue, in the Co-op City section of the Bronx, New York City, United States. The school is designated as an Empowerment School by the New York City Department of Education, which allows it more autonomy in choosing a curriculum. Truman shares a uniquely designed and interconnected campus with two middle schools, MS 180 and 181, and two elementary schools, PS 178 and 153. The campus was designed to be a one-stop and close-to-home solution for students and families in the Co-op City neighborhood, although many of the students commute to school from other parts of the city. Harry S. Truman High School is located in Taylor, Michigan in Metro Detroit. It was opened in 1973 as a combined High School and Middle School. The original school physical plant was designed using the Open School concept, which meant they had classrooms with no walls. But after several years of operating using that concept and a configuration as a combined senior/middle school, Taylor School District leaders decided to change the school into a stand-alone high school.
