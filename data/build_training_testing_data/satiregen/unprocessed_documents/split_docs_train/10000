 Several Yemeni men belonging to al Qaeda took part in the terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi last September, according to several sources who have spoken with CNN. One senior U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that "three or four members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula," or AQAP, took part in the attack. Another source briefed on the Benghazi investigation said Western intelligence services suspect the men may have been sent by the group specifically to carry out the attack. But it's not been ruled out that they were already in the city and participated as the opportunity arose.  It has been a rocky couple of years for the people of Egypt. Since the 2011 revolution, the economy has tanked, street protests are an almost daily occurrence and the political situation remains volatile.

"We are like a little beam of sunlight, coming through and reminding people, 'Don't worry!  Three goals in just 10 second half minutes sank Basel and set Chelsea on their way to the Europa League final Thursday and an Amsterdam date with Portuguese giants Benfica. Leading 2-1 from the first leg in Switzerland, Chelsea trailed at half time of their home leg at Stamford Bridge to an injury time goal from rising young Egyptian star Mohamed Salah. But their fears were allayed as Fernando Torres, Victor Moses and David Luiz, who will be facing his old club in the final, struck to snuff out Basel's hopes. Benfica, trailing 1-0 from the first leg in Turkey against Fenerbahce, went through 3-2 on aggregate after a hard-fought 3-1 home win.
