 The frenetic pace of presidential campaigning that has crested in the last few days -- in which the candidates or their surrogates hit 10 states -- won't end when voters go to the polls on Tuesday. Republican candidate Mitt Romney will campaign in two states on Election Day - Ohio and Pennsylvania - according to a Romney campaign official. Campaigning on Election Day, a senior Romney adviser says, will help "keep the energy going" until the polls close. The idea is that the campaign is "just going to keep working up until the polls close," said the same Romney adviser.  On the eve of the presidential election, Mitt Romney and President Obama both made their emotional final appeals to voters. Speaking in Des Moines, Michelle Obama delivered a passionate speech about the race and the president appeared to wipe away tears at what will be his final campaign event. On Starting Point this morning, Obama campaign surrogate Rep. Jim Clyburn discusses the emotional side of political campaigns and weighs in on how Hurricane Sandy may influence the election results. "Obama did a tremendous job reaching out to the other side time and time again," Clyburn says.  Tea Party Patriots National Coordinator Keli Carender talks with Soledad O'Brien this morning on "Starting Point," arguing why GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney was not a good candidate. She says Republicans did not have a good ground game and "sat on their hands" after the 2009 election, and she argues that having Romney as a candidate meant they couldn't criticize Obamacare. “In a nutshell, the Republicans sat on their hands for four years," Carender says. "After 2008, you had Barack Obama and the Democrats who left paid staffers in critical swing states and offices open, and they were working to identify new voters… that they managed to register in the four years between the two elections.
