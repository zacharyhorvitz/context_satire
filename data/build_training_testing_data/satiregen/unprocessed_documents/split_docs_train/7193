 The intrigue over the whereabouts of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un deepened Friday after the country's state news agency failed to issue a report about his expected visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang. In previous years, Kim has visited the shrines of his late father and grandfather at midnight on the eve of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of North Korea. The Workers' Party, founded in 1945, is North Korea's political party and is considered one of the country's most crucial institutions alongside the military. Kim Jong Un misses shrine visit KCNA has typically filed a report on the visit within hours of it happening, but so far this year nothing has been issued. North Korean State media did not report Jong-il's death until 51 hours after it occurred, apparently due to the political jockeying and discussions that surrounded the official version of Jong-il's legacy, as well as agreeing upon the membership of the Funeral Committee of Kim Jong-il. On the morning of 19 December, all work units, schools, government agencies, and military personnel were informed of a major announcement to take place at noon. At noon, Ri Chun-hee, a Korean Central Television news anchor, clad in full black traditional Korean clothing, announced the death of Kim Jong-il. Ri had previously announced the death of Kim Il-sung in 1994. A former CIA official said earlier reports of a health crisis were likely accurate. North Korean media remained silent on the issue. An Associated Press report said analysts believed Kim had been supporting moderates in the foreign ministry, while North Korea's powerful military was against so-called "Six-Party" negotiations with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States aimed towards ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons. Some United States officials noted that soon after rumours about Kim's health were publicized a month before, North Korea had taken a "tougher line in nuclear negotiations".
