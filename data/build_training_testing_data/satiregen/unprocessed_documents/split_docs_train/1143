The 2016 presidential campaign of Rick Santorum, former United States Senator from Pennsylvania, was formally announced at a rally in Pittsburgh on May 27, 2015. His campaign for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2016 was his second bid for the office, after having been a candidate in 2012, where he received the second most delegates after 2012 nominee Mitt Romney.  Meet Rick Santorum, 2.0. He was conservatives' pick to take on Mitt Romney in the 2012 GOP presidential primary, but in an exclusive interview with CNN's Erin Burnett on Thursday night Santorum seemed ready to turn over a new leaf. The former Pennsylvania senator once compared homosexuality to beastiality. But he showed a more accepting tone on Thursday, saying he would accept an endorsement from transgender icon Caitlyn Jenner.  Even when you're the defending champion of the Iowa caucuses, there's no guarantee you'll find big crowds at every stop. When Rick Santorum stopped by Sam's Soda and Sandwiches in Carroll, Iowa, on Monday afternoon, he was met with three of his own staffers, two Democratic campaign trackers, a waitress, two diners and one CNN reporter. Though it may not have been the reception he hoped for, the former Pennsylvania senator took it in stride, spending about an hour drinking a chocolate milkshake and chatting with the two diners.
