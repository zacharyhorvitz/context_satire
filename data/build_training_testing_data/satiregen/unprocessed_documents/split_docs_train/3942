In the first book, The Cold Dish, Walt is mentioned as having been the sheriff of Absaroka County and plans to run for re-election again the following year. He investigates the murders of two white teenagers who had been found guilty, but not severely punished, for raping a local Indian girl, Melissa Little Bird. Walt is a widower; Martha, his wife, was murdered in Denver, Co, while suffering from cancer (in the TV series; in the books she died of cancer). With Martha, he had a daughter, Cady, who is now an attorney in Philadelphia. In "As the Crow Flies", Walt mentions that he dated Martha before he was drafted, and that their relationship resumed after he came home from the war. The two eloped and were married by a justice of the peace in Miles City, Montana, when her father refused to pay for a big church wedding. he position of a married woman ... is, in many respects, precisely similar to that of the negro slave. She can make no contract and hold no property; whatever she inherits or earns becomes at that moment the property of her husband.... Though he acquired a fortune through her, or though she earned a fortune through her talents, he is the sole master of it, and she cannot draw a penny....n the English common law a married woman is nothing at all. She passes out of legal existence.
