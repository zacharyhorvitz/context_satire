 LeBron James extended his feud Saturday with a Fox News host after she made comments about his grammar and diction while complaining about his political beliefs. The Cleveland Cavaliers forward responded again in his days-long back-and-forth with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who took to her show on Thursday to tell James that he should "shut up and dribble." Late Friday, James issued a response in the form of a photo uploaded to his Instagram account that read "I am more than an athlete" and included the hashtag "#wewillnotshutupanddribble." At an NBA news conference on Saturday, James reiterated his stance, telling reporters that he and fellow players "will definitely not shut up and dribble."
