 Jimmy Fallon used his "Tonight Show" platform to call on gun control advocates to participate in this Saturday's March for Our Lives demonstrations. "I just want to remind everybody that this Saturday, March 24, students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have organized a march in Washington," Fallon said on Tuesday's show. "It's called the March for Our Lives, and it's to tell the government, loud and clear, that we demand change on the issue of gun control." The main march will be held in Washington, D.C., with more than 800 related events taking place around the world.  Just five weeks ago, a gunman killed 17 of their friends and teachers at school and changed the course of their lives. This weekend, the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School led a historic march for gun control, what they called a March for Our Lives. Here's how the Parkland, Florida, students went from experiencing a mass tragedy to launching a mass movement. They took immediate action Within days of the February 14 shooting, the students made clear that thoughts and prayers were not enough for them -- they wanted concrete legislative solutions to the epidemic of mass shootings and an end to the influence of the National Rifle Association.  Survivors of last month's deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, are preparing to take their fight for stricter gun control laws to Washington. This week's March for Our Lives is the culmination of a monthlong effort to honor the 17 students and faculty members killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and rally Americans across the United States to say enough to gun violence. With momentum from the National School Walkout still going strong, students are demanding that their voices be heard. Here's what you should know about the March for Our Lives: What is it?
