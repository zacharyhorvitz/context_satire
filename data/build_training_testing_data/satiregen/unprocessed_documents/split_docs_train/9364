 President Barack Obama told reporters at the White House that he will hold a news conference on Friday. Obama responded to a shouted question at an appearance on Thursday with the Greek prime minister that he would hold a news conference the next day. The president is scheduled to go on vacation next week with his family, while Congress is away for its summer break. By the time his son Jimmy was four years old, Carter had purchased a new home. When he took the children to see the house, he realized that he had left his key behind. A wooden bar allowed only a small space for the windows to open, too small to allow access for an adult. Carter sent Jimmy through the window to open the door. "When he returned to Alego he was very thin and dirty. He had difficulty walking, and his head was full of lice." For some time, he was too traumatized to speak about his experiences. His wife told his grandson Obama: "From that day on, I saw that he was now an old man."
