The campaign has been criticized positively and negatively by consumers, critiques, and other companies because of the way Dove has chosen to portray their messages for their audience. Writing for The New York Times, Tanzina Vega produced the article “ Ad About Women’s Self-Image Creates a Sensation”. In this piece it portrayed how different people viewed the Dove Real Beauty Campaign in different ways. First, was “Brenda Fiala, a senior vice president for strategy at Blast Radius, a digital advertising agency. Inspired by market research that suggested only 4% of women describe themselves as beautiful (up from 2% in 2004), and around 54% believe that when it comes to how they look, they are their own worst beauty critic, Unilever's Dove brand has been conducting a marketing campaign called Dove Campaign for Real Beauty that aims to celebrate women's natural beauty since 2005. According to Anselmo Ramos, creative director of Ogilvy & Mather, and head of the Real Beauty Sketches project, the goal of the Real Beauty Campaign is to find a way to convince the other 96% they are also beautiful. In September 2004, Dove began its Campaign for Real Beauty, followed by the creation of the Dove Self-Esteem Fund in 2006, by Geyner Andres Gaona and Amy. The campaign has been criticized as hypocritical in light of the highly sexualized images of women presented in the advertising of Axe, which, like Dove, is produced by Unilever.
