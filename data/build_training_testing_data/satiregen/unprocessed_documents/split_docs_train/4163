Chicago ( (listen), locally also ), officially the City of Chicago, is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Illinois, and the third-most-populous city in the United States. With an estimated population of 2,705,994 (2018), it is also the most populous city in the Midwestern United States. Chicago is the county seat of Cook County, the second-most-populous county in the US, with a small portion of the northwest side of the city extending into DuPage County near O'Hare Airport. Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland.  A war among criminals rages on in America's third-largest city, with innocent residents caught in the crossfire. Over the holiday weekend, Chicago passed an ominous threshold: So far in 2016, 2,000 people have been victims of gun violence. In all of last year, 2,988 people were victims of gun violence, according to records kept by The Chicago Tribune. Over the Fourth of July weekend, four people were killed and 46 were injured in 42 shootings and a stabbing, according to a release from Chicago police.  Mark Kirk, one of the most vulnerable Senate Republicans in the country, is betting that he can survive a tough election season by taking on Donald Trump. The Illinois senator became the first Republican last month to release an anti-Trump television ad, which said his party's presumptive nominee "is not fit to be commander in chief." The 32-second spot, running in the Chicago market, outlines Kirk's efforts to present himself to voters in his liberal-leaning state as more moderate than his fellow Republicans in Washington. "Mark was the first Republican to support a vote on President Obama's Supreme Court nominee," the television commercial says.
