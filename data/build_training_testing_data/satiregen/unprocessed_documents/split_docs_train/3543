Uber Technologies, Inc., commonly known as Uber, is an American multinational ride-hailing company offering services that include peer-to-peer ridesharing, ride service hailing, food delivery, and a micromobility system with electric bikes and scooters. The company is based in San Francisco and has operations in over 785 metropolitan areas worldwide. Its platforms can be accessed via its websites and mobile apps. As of 2019, Uber is estimated to have 110 million worldwide users. Passengers use an app to order a  ride, where they are quoted the fare. Uber uses a dynamic pricing model; prices for the same route vary according to supply and demand for rides at the time that the ride is requested. At the end of the ride, payment is made based on the rider's pre-selected preferences, such as a credit card on file, Google Pay, Apple Pay, PayPal, cash, or, in India, Airtel mobile wallet or Unified Payments Interface. After the ride is over, the rider is given the option to provide a gratuity to the driver, which is also billed to the rider's payment method.  Pebble just announced all of its new products for this year and -- surprise! -- the company is making its first-ever, non-smartwatch device, called the Pebble Core. The Core is a tiny cube-sized computer that's meant to work with a Pebble smartwatch and take the place of a smartphone. The Core can take a SIM card to get 3G cellular service and it contains a GPS tracker and a microphone.
