On 20 September 2007, the Swiss parliament decided to acknowledge Anna Göldi's case as a miscarriage of justice. Fritz Schiesser, as the representative for Glarus in the Swiss parliament, called for Anna Göldi's exoneration, which was granted 226 years after her death, on 27 August 2008 on the grounds that she had been subjected to an "illegal trial". Apparently, Göldi's married employer abused his power after she had threatened to reveal their affair. A native of Sennwald, Anna Göldi arrived in Glarus in 1765. When she was 31, Göldi was impregnated by a mercenary, who left Switzerland before Göldi gave birth. Göldi's baby died the first night it was born (something not uncommon due to the high infant mortality of the era). She was pilloried and sentenced to six years of house arrest. Göldi began working as a maid for the Tschudi family in 1780. Jakob Tschudi reported her for having put needles in the bread and milk of one of his daughters, apparently through supernatural means. Göldi at first escaped arrest, but the authorities of the Canton of Glarus advertised a reward for her capture in the Zürcher Zeitung on 9 February 1782. Göldi was arrested and, under torture, admitted to entering in a pact with the Devil, who had appeared to her as a black dog.
