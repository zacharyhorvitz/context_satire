 Former Gov. Ted Strickland (D-OH) argues that President Obama is largely responsible for the economic recovery in his state as the Democratic National Convention kicks off Tuesday. “The auto industry is doing really well, investments are being made, thousands of people are working as a result, and the president is responsible for that,” says Strickland. The former Ohio governor and national co-chair for the Obama campaign said he is “confident” that Obama will win Ohio in the fall and said he “will speak the truth” about the president’s influence on Ohio’s economic recovery in a convention speech late Tuesday. Lawrence describes an episode on 20 November 1917 while reconnoitering Dera'a in disguise, when he was captured by the Ottoman military, heavily beaten, and sexually abused by the local bey and his guardsmen, though he does not specify the nature of the sexual contact. Some scholars have stated that he exaggerated the severity of the injuries that he suffered, or alleged that the episode never actually happened. There is no independent testimony, but the multiple consistent reports and the absence of evidence for outright invention in Lawrence's works make the account believable to his biographers. Malcolm Brown, John E. Mack, and Jeremy Wilson have argued that this episode had strong psychological effects on Lawrence, which may explain some of his unconventional behaviour in later life. During the closing years of the war, Lawrence sought to convince his superiors in the British government that Arab independence was in their interests, but he met with mixed success. The secret Sykes-Picot Agreement between France and Britain contradicted the promises of independence that he had made to the Arabs and frustrated his work.
