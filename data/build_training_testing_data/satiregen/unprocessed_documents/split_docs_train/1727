Pantene () is a Swiss-created American brand of hair care products owned by Procter & Gamble. The product line was first introduced in Europe in 1945 by Hoffmann-La Roche of Switzerland, which branded the name based on panthenol as a shampoo ingredient. It was purchased by Procter & Gamble (P&G) in 1985 in order for P&G to compete in the "beauty product" market rather than only functional products.The brand's best-known product became the 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioning formula, Pantene Pro-V (Pantene Pro-Vitamin). The product became most noted due to an advertising campaign in the late 1980s in which fashion models said, "Don't hate me because I'm beautiful." In 1990, Procter & Gamble Taiwan launched a new advertising campaign surrounding its new Pantene Pro-V formula, a combining of Pantene's vitamin formula and P&G's 2-in-1 technology. Pantene Pro-V was first introduced in Taiwan and a year later in the US and globally. Research results, compiled from markets around the world, led P&G to hypothesize that health positioning might provide the basis for a new worldwide hair care franchise. The research indicated that: Women believed the ideal standard for hair is "healthy". Pantene (/ˌpænˈtiːn, -ˈtɛn/) is a Swiss-created American brand of hair care products owned by Procter & Gamble.
