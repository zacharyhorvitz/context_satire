In July 2018, more waste water was spilled into the river surrounding the Gold King Mine area. The truck driver was an employee of the EPA and the truck was carrying nine cubic yards of sludge, all of which spilled into the water. After this occurred, the EPA did not respond to requests for comment from the press. The sludge would have been brought to the EPAâ€™s treatment plant made specifically for waste water in the area if there was still space. On October 2, 1988, in the small town of Middlesex, Virginia, troubled teenager Donnie Darko, led by a mysterious voice, sleepwalks out of his home. Once outside, he meets a figure in a monstrous rabbit costume who introduces himself as Frank and tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. Donnie wakes up the next morning on the green of a local golf course and returns home to discover a jet engine has crashed into his bedroom. His older sister Elizabeth tells him the FAA investigators do not know its origin. January 2018 emails between the EPA, the White House, and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) made public following a Freedom of Information Act request showed that the White House and EPA under Pruitt decided to halt the publication of a study done by the DHHS Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). The study, an assessment of the chemical pollutants PFOS and PFOA, showed that the substances present dangers to human health at far lower levels than the EPA previously deemed safe. An email from a White House official said that the administration feared a "potential public relations nightmare."
