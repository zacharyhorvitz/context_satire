 North Korea test-fired three short-range anti-ship missiles off its east coast on Sunday, a South Korean defense official told CNN. "North Korea on June 14 fired three KN-01 missiles near North Korea's eastern city towards sea off east of the peninsula," the South Korean Defense Ministry official said. The missiles were reportedly fired between 4:21 p.m. and 4:47 p.m. (3:21 a.m. to 3:47 a.m. ET), according to South Korea.  Kim Jong Un watched two drills featuring what North Korean media called a new type of "anti-ship rockets," according to the country's newspaper Rodong Sinmun. The front page of the state newspaper featured pictures of a beaming Kim leaning back in a chair, surrounded by his smiling military cabal. Rodong Sinmun reported two drills -- one in daylight with anti-ship rockets and another one at night, testing both ground artillery and warships. The reports did not specify exactly where and exactly when the drills were held.  A North Korean soldier defected to South Korea on Monday across the heavily fortified border that separates the two countries, South Korean authorities said. The soldier crossed the Military Demarcation Line on foot from the eastern North Korean province of Gangwon, said a South Korean Defense Ministry official, who declined to be identified. Further details on the circumstances of the defection weren't immediately available. There was no reaction to the news on North Korean state media.
