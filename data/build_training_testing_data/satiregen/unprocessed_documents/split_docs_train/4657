Television director Joe Wright was hired in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his feature film directorial debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who were looking for a fresh perspective; they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, "I didn't know if I was really all that interested; I thought I was a little bit more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. For Wright, casting became a lengthy process, particularly choosing the right actors for his protagonists. Having previously worked together with Keira Knightley on Pride & Prejudice, Wright expressed his admiration for the actress, stating, “I think she’s a really extraordinary actress”. Particularly in reference to the character’s unlikeability, Wright commended her bravery in tackling this type of role without any fear of how the audience will receive this characterisation, stating “ It’s a character that’s not always likeable and I think so many young actors these days are terrified of being disliked at any given moment in case the audience doesn’t come and pay their box-office money to see them again. Keira is not afraid of that. After Director Joe Wright took over the project, Hampton re-wrote much of the original script upon Wright's suggestion. The first draft took what Hampton called a more ‘conventional, literary approach,’ with a voice over and the epilogue of the older Briony being weaved in throughout the entire film instead of at the end.
