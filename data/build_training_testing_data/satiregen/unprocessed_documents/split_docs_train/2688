In December 2016, in the Rolling Stone video series 'Her Sound, Her Story: Tina Arena', she discusses how the music industry squanders women as both they and their careers mature. "You've got to give me a really damn good reason why somebody, who is in the prime of their career and are doing really good work, why on earth they should stop? Are you going to tell a male who is at the top of his game in whatever domain, that he needs to step down and retire?". Speaking to series creators Michelle Grace Hunder and Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore, Arena goes on to talk about the importance of female solidarity, mentioning how competition between women can be (and has been) dismantled by supportive relationships and encouragement of other women. After her early success as a child actor, she returned to acting at age 18, with what remains one of her best known roles to date, the character Deb in the 2004 film Napoleon Dynamite. Since her return to acting, she has been in television series such as Veronica Mars, Big Love, True Blood and Grey's Anatomy. She returned to the role of Mac in the Veronica Mars movie, and has played the part of Maggie Harris on the television series Legends. She later appeared in the recurring role of Florence in the television series Scorpion. In 2012, Arena and her family relocated from Paris to reside in Melbourne, Victoria. She moved back, full-time, at the end of October 2012, after almost two decades living in France and London, with her partner, Vincent Mancini and their son. Arena says, "It was time. I've been away 20-odd years, worked internationally and done some great things,  I just felt it was time to come home".
