 Mark Sanford is heading back to Washington after detours along the Appalachian Trail and Argentina. The former South Carolina governor finished his second term in office three years ago with his political career dead in the water thanks to a well-publicized extra-marital affair and ethics violations. But he came away Tuesday with a victory over Democratic opponent Elizabeth Colbert Busch in the special election for a vacant House seat in the Palmetto State's 1st Congressional District -- the same seat he once held. Here's what we've learned, or better yet, re-learned, from Sanford's victory 1. After telling Vogue magazine that her husband was having a "midlife crisis," Sanford’s wife, Jenny Sanford, moved out of the South Carolina Governor’s Mansion with the couple’s four sons, returning to the family home on Sullivan’s Island. On December 11, 2009, she announced that she was filing for divorce, calling it a "sad and painful process." The divorce was finalized in March 2010. A stipulation within the divorce papers required that while on the Sanford family’s Coosaw plantation, "no airplanes will be flown at children." Marshall Clement "Mark" Sanford Jr. (born May 28, 1960) is an American politician and author. A Republican, Sanford is a former governor of South Carolina and a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Sanford served as the U.S. representative for South Carolina's 1st congressional district from 1995 to 2001. He won the 2002 South Carolina gubernatorial election, defeating Democratic incumbent Jim Hodges.
