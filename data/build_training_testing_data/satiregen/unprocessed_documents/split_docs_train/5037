 Mitt Romney has a reputation for pragmatism, deliberation and playing it safe. But if Romney reveals his vice presidential pick this week, as the latest round of campaign chatter suggests, he'll be throwing out the traditional campaign playbook that says a running mate should be announced around a national party convention for maximum impact, just as voters are starting to pay attention to the campaign. Rarely has a presidential hopeful gone public with his running mate selection more than a week before his party's convention. Who will run with Romney?  New ads from the presidential campaigns encapsulate where the race stands, with President Barack Obama's camp continuing its assault on his challenger over his business record and refusal to share tax records and Mitt Romney trying to make allegations of cronyism knock the incumbent off the assault. A new Romney TV commercial advances the campaign's latest attack strategy, accusing Obama's administration of sending taxpayer dollars to failed energy companies whose owners contributed to his campaign. "Where did all the Obama stimulus money go?" the ad's narrator asks against a backdrop of burning cash. After the second presidential debate, a North Carolina radio station interviewed Romney and asked him what it was like "to hear the president of the United States call your dad a liar." Romney laughed and replied: "Jump out of your seat and you want to rush down to the stage and take a swing at him. But you know you can't do that because, well, first because there's a lot of Secret Service between you and him, but also because that's the nature of the process. They're gonna try to do everything they can do to try to make my dad into someone he's not.
