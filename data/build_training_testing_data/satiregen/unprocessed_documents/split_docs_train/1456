 Netflix released "13 Reasons Why," a series about the suicide of a 17-year-old girl, on the final day of March 2017. Immediately, the profitable streaming service received criticism from suicide prevention organizations for not portraying suicide in a responsible way. New research suggests that, as feared, the series caused a "suicide contagion" effect among young people. An estimated 13% increase in suicide among children and teens, ages 10 to 19, occurred in the three months after the show's release, the researchers found. On August 1, 2012, a new Harvard Library organization began operations, designed to improve a fragmented system of 73 libraries across Harvard's Schools with one that promotes University-wide collaboration. Functions that occur within all libraries—Access Services, Technical Services and Preservation Services—were unified to enable greater focus on the needs of the user community. The new structure was developed from recommendations of the Task Force on University Libraries and the Library Implementation Working Group. Harvard is a famously decentralized university, noted for the "every tub on its own bottom" independence of its various constituent faculties. They set their own academic standards and manage their own budgets. The president, however, plays an important part in university-wide planning and strategy. Each names a faculty's dean (and, since the foundation of the office in 1994, the university's provost), and grants tenure to recommended professors; however, he or she is expected to make such decisions after extensive consultation with faculty members.
