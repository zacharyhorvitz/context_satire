 A generation of students raised in the shadow of gun violence is sending a loud and united message to lawmakers: Enough is enough. A month after a gunman killed 17 people at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, students across the country demanded lawmakers set up measures to prevent another mass shooting. In an unprecedented show of unity dubbed National Walkout Day, students put down their books and left class at 10 a.m. in each time zone for at least 17 minutes -- one for each person killed at the Florida school. Some students spelled out the word "Enough" on football fields with their bodies.  A month ago, a former student roamed the halls of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, opening fire on terrified students and teachers at the Parkland, Florida, school. The massacre of 17 students and faculty members added to a grim statistic: Three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern US history happened within five months of one another. In the four weeks since the Valentine's Day shooting, the survivors have turned into activists on the national stage. Even as they grieve, they've demanded action on gun reform.  The National Rifle Association is suing the state of Florida after Gov. Rick Scott signed Senate Bill 7026 into law Friday, the first gun control legislation enacted in the state after the Parkland school massacre on February 14. The NRA suit focuses on the part of the law that raises the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21 from 18. "This bill punishes law-abiding gun owners for the criminal acts of a deranged individual," executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action Chris W. Cox said.
