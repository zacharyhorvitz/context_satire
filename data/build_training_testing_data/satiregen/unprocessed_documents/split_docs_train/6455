In 2011, Kid Rock was honored by the NAACP, which sparked protests stemming from his past display of the Confederate flag in his concerts. During the ceremony, Kid Rock elaborated on his display of the flag, stating, " never flew the flag with hate in my heart  I love America, I love Detroit, and I love black people." Kid Rock's publicist announced that 2011 was the year he officially distanced himself from the flag.  A private jet carrying Chris Brown made an emergency landing in Burbank, California, Monday after smoke filled the cockpit, the singer's representative confirmed Tuesday. The incident, first reported by TMZ, happened as Brown was on his way from Los Angeles to New York to attend Monday night's Met Gala event. The Gulfstream jet quickly returned to the Burbank airport when passengers and crew noticed the smoke just minutes after take off, TMZ reported. Brown resumed his trip without incident on another jet later, but missed the event, TMZ reported. The album was recorded at the White Room in Detroit and mixed at the Mix Room in Los Angeles. With the introduction of disc jockey and turntablist Uncle Kracker into Kid Rock's backing band, Twisted Brown Trucker was given a "melodic sensibility", according to Kid Rock's attorney, Tommy Valentino; Kracker cowrote many of the album's songs, helping Kid Rock write verses and giving him feedback on his lyrics. In addition to the newly written songs, the band also re-recorded some of Kid Rock's older songs, including "I Am the Bullgod" from Kid Rock's earlier EP Fire It Up and "Black Chick, White Guy" from the album Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp. During the recording sessions, Eminem was mixing The Slim Shady LP at the same studio, and, being friends with Kid Rock, asked him to record scratching for Eminem's song "My Fault", which was set to appear on Eminem's album; in return, Eminem delivered a guest rap verse on Kid Rock's song "Fuck Off" for this album.
