 Donald Trump formally unveiled Mike Pence as his running mate Saturday, candidly saying he hoped the pick would unite the fractured Republican Party, in a typically unconventional rollout event that was more about the man at the top of the ticket than his new sidekick. The presumptive Republican nominee introduced the Indiana governor at a Manhattan hotel two days before the start of the Republican National Convention. It was a spectacle that underscored the odd couple nature of the GOP ticket, that now unites Trump, a brash, volatile outsider with a sparse ideological track record, with Pence, a strait-laced, disciplined warrior of the social conservative movement. "He's really got the skills of a highly talented executive," Trump said, adding, "Mike Pence is a man of honor character and honestly.  Chris Christie ripped into Ted Cruz's performance on the third night of the Republican National Convention, after the Texas senator was booed from the stage Wednesday night for declining to endorse Donald Trump. "I think it was awful. And quite frankly, I think it was something selfish," the New Jersey governor told CNN's Dana Bash. Christie, who is also a former 2016 rival, said Cruz broke the signed pledge he made to the Republican Party during the nomination process to support the eventual nominee.  Donald Trump's attempts to show affection for Mike Pence -- and the Indiana governor's apparent resistance with a stiff arm -- led to an "air kiss" from the Republican presidential nominee to his running mate Wednesday. The exchange between the two men who are still getting to know each other was teased on social media. In the hour after the final Republican National Committee speech ended Wednesday, searches for "air kiss" spiked 2,800%, according to data from Google.
