In 1989, he played television station owner R.J. Fletcher in Weird Al Yankovic's film UHF. Yankovic noted that "Kevin McCarthy was terrific. We had set him up to be this really rotten bad guy; but every time the director said, 'CUT!,' McCarthy would burst out laughing." In his will, according to Candice Bergen's memoir, 'A Fine Romance,' he left his daughter nothing, but bequeathed his dummy, Charlie McCarthy,  $10,000. "I’d chased my father's approval all my life, and here was proof I’d never get it," the actress wrote. "I was hurt, shocked, when I discovered he had left me out of his will." She further explained that her father had provided this inheritance for the dummy, so that the funds could be managed, invested, and reinvested to provide for his future performances. Bergen was a technically skilled ventriloquist, but after his talent moved to radio, it was more important that Charlie McCarthy be clearly understood, so Bergen's skill at not moving his lips was allowed to slip- and Charlie McCarthy frequently twitted him for moving his lips— but Bergen's sense of comedic timing was superb, and he handled Charlie's snappy dialog with aplomb. Bergen's wit in creating McCarthy's striking personality and that of his other characters was the making of the show. Bergen's popularity as a ventriloquist on radio, where the trick of "throwing his voice" was not visible, suggests his appeal was primarily the personality he applied to his characters.
