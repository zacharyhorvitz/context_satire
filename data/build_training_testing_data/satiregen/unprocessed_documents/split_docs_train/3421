 After days of dropping a series of slithering clues, the Taylor Swift surprise machine has struck again. The singer has put speculation to rest by announcing she will release a new album called "Reputation" on November 10, according to social media posts. She is set to unveil a new single from the album Thursday night. The reveal comes just two days after Swift stirred her passionate fans into a frenzy with cryptic teases featuring a snake on her social media account.  Taylor Swift has a message in her new single, "Look What You Made Me Do," and she says it rather plainly. "I'm sorry, but the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now," she sings. "Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead."  If you aren't a major Taylor Swift fan (a.k.a. a "Swiftie"), you are going to have to shake it off over the next few days. That's because Swift is set to release new music for the first time in three years, beginning with a single that will drop Thursday night. Here's what we know so far: The first single may be called "Timeless" That's what some believe because the site for timeless.com states "Timeless coming soon."
