Harrison married model Pattie Boyd on 21 January 1966, with McCartney serving as best man. Harrison and Boyd had met in 1964 during the production of the film A Hard Day's Night, in which the 19-year-old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl. They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalised in 1977. Boyd said her decision to end the marriage was due largely to George's repeated infidelities. In 1978, O'Hara was diagnosed with uterine cancer, which had to be removed with an operation. She was greatly affected by John Wayne's own cancer during this period, and Wayne reportedly wept on the phone when she informed him that her own cancer had been given the all clear. O'Hara was instrumental in Wayne being given a special medal shortly before his death the following year. She argued that "John Wayne is not just an actor. While questioning Brady and Hindley, the police read out the names of other missing children and teenagers who have recently vanished in and around Manchester. To most of the names, Brady and Hindley respond "Never heard of him/her", with the exception of one: Pauline Reade, who had been Hindley's neighbour in Gorton. The evidence against the couple continues to mount, and when the police discover Brady's suitcase, they find pornographic photographs of a young girl, quickly identified as Lesley Ann Downey, as well as an audio tape recording of the girl being sexually abused and pleading to be allowed to go home. David and Maureen Smith are also taken in for questioning after Brady and Hindley imply that Smith was involved in the murder of Edward Evans, and was also present in the house when Lesley Ann Downey was being sexually abused.
