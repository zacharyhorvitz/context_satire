It is within the category of the destructive madmen  that one needs to situate certain patients to whom I would like to give the name of necrophiliacs . The alienists have adopted, as a new form, the case of Sergeant Bertrand, the disinterrer of cadavers on whom all the newspapers have recently reported. However, don't think that we are dealing here with a form of phrenopathy which appears for the first time. The ancients, in speaking about lycanthropy, have cited examples to which one can more or less relate the case which has just now attracted the public attention so strongly. In Renaissance Italy, following the reputed moral collapse brought about by the Black Death and before the Roman Inquisition of the Counter-Reformation, literature was replete with sexual references; these include necrophilia, as in the epic poem Orlando Innamorato by Matteo Maria Boiardo, first published in 1483. In a notorious modern example, American serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was a necrophiliac. Dahmer wanted to create a sex slave that would mindlessly consent to whatever he wanted. When his attempts failed, and his male victim died, he would keep the corpse until it decomposed beyond recognition, continuously masturbating and performing sexual intercourse on the body. The film is a firsthand account of Dahmer's lifestyle as a serial killer. When he was finally caught, it was revealed that his apartment was a chamber of horrors, where, according to the film, he tortured his young victims to death. Then he sliced up the bodies and stored the parts in his freezer, among other places. The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer was produced one year before Dahmer was himself murdered in prison.
