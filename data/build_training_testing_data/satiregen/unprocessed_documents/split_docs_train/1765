 President Donald Trump, in an attempt to sell the GOP Republican health care plan, warned Republicans about breaking all those promises to repeal Obamacare they've made over the years. The White House is currently unsure that Republicans have enough votes to pass the GOP health care bill. And for a president who fashions himself a deal-maker, the law has become a potent test of Trump's ability to make it happen. "The American people voted for historic change.  Rep. Mark Walker, chairman of a conservative group in the House called the Republican Study Committee, predicted Friday would be a "good moment" for Democrats. "Probably that champagne that wasn't popped in November may be utilized this evening," he said. "We'll see." He was right.  Republicans are focused on trying to come together after a major setback last week to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act -- and they aren't entirely ready to move on. Emerging from their first conference meeting since the setback, Republican members said the message from their leadership was direct: it's time to unify. "I think it was the longest prayer we've ever had," New York Republican Rep. Chris Collins said, referring to the opening prayer that is part of every conference. Many members emerging from the Tuesday morning meeting said the GOP wasn't yet ready to abandon health care despite the fact that President Donald Trump made it clear last week it was time to get on to tax reform.
