Republicanism in New Zealand is a political position that holds that New Zealand's system of government should be changed from a constitutional monarchy to a republic. New Zealand republicanism dates back to the 19th century, although until the late 20th century it was a fringe movement. The current main republican lobby group, New Zealand Republic, was established in 1994. Because New Zealand's constitution is uncodified, a republic could be enacted by statute, as a simple act of parliament.  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz promised his party Tuesday that he is "not suspending our fight for liberty." And that is precisely what many Senate Republicans fear. As he returns to Capitol Hill after ending his presidential campaign, Cruz has grown more powerful and influential with core GOP voters, giving him a major platform to upend his party leadership's most carefully constructed plans. And as Congress prepares to deal with major national issues -- including a rescue plan for Puerto Rico requiring immediate action and government funding in the fall -- many believe Cruz could use his new bully pulpit to wreak havoc on Capitol Hill should he want to.  President George W. Bush is staying out of presidential campaign politics, a spokesman said Wednesday, an announcement that came just after Donald Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive nominee. "President Bush does not plan to participate in or comment on the presidential campaign," Bush spokesman Freddy Ford told CNN. The statement comes just a day after a source familiar with Bush family plans said former President George H.W. Bush would not attend the Republican convention in Cleveland and George W. Bush is unlikely to show up.
