 When a blizzard strikes, it's not all fun and games with snowmen and sledding. A major snowstorm can be a big disruption to the economy, leaving some buried in losses while creating opportunities for others. "From a retailer perspective, it's devastating," said Britt Beemer, CEO at America's Research Group. Retailers lose 85% of their business, he estimates.  Uber is putting a lid on fares as the blizzard. The taxi app normally lets prices surge when demand is heavy -- like when public transportation grinds to a halt and driving is hazardous because of a storm. During this storm, Uber will instead aim to keep fares in line with where they have stood recently. And it says it will donate its share of fares to charity. In the late 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very concerned about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of The Malay Archipelago.
