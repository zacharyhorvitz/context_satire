The new "middle school" model began to appear in the mid-1960s. Wiles said, "At first, it was difficult to determine the difference between a junior high school and a middle school, but as the middle school became established, the differences became more pronounced". Middle School is in between elementary school and high school, and has 6 to 8th graders. Junior High schools are preparing seventh, eighth, and ninth grade students for High School.
