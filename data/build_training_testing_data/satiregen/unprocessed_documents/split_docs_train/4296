 Taking the whole family on a Disney World vacation is almost always a pricey experience — especially if you decide to go during peak season. To travel smarter (and avoid the long lines, scorching temperatures and steep prices), SkySkanner recommends booking your Disney getaway during January. That's because "average savings price for flight tickets to Orlando in January is 27% off compared to average ticket prices for the rest of the year." Keeping that in mind, you're going to want to begin planning your trip now (including where to stay and what to do) because — believe it or not — the new year is just around the corner. By October 2016, Disney had scheduled multiple release dates for untitled Marvel Studios films for 2020 and 2021. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said some of the films for those dates were already known, explaining, "We know what  we'd like them to be for 2020. Over the years, where we're aiming we've been lucky enough that it's usually been the same thing but we always leave ourselves the opportunity to bob and weave and adapt if we have to." Feige was not sure if Marvel would continue to group the films of the MCU into phases once Phase Three concluded in 2019, saying that "it might be a new thing", but by December 2018 Marvel was believed to be using the term Phase Four. The release of The Jungle Book and The Happiest Millionaire in 1967 raised the total number of feature films that Disney had been involved in to 81. When Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day was released in 1968, it earned Disney an Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category, awarded posthumously. After Disney's death, his studios continued to produce live-action films prolifically but largely abandoned animation until the late 1980s, after which there was what The New York Times describes as the "Disney Renaissance" that began with The Little Mermaid (1989). Disney's companies continue to produce successful film, television and stage entertainment.
