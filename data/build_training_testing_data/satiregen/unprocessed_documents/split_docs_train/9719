 The State Department announced Friday that incidents of acoustic attacks on US diplomats in Havana, Cuba, which have led to a variety of serious medical symptoms, continued until as recently as last month. "As we've said previously, an investigation into the incidents is ongoing, and we revise our assessments as we receive new information," State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. "We can confirm another incident which occurred last month and is now part of the investigation." "Based on continued assessments of personnel, there are now 19 confirmed U.S. government personnel who have been affected," she added, updating her previous count of "at least 16 US government employees." The United States Secretary of Labor is a member of the Cabinet of the United States, and as the head of the United States Department of Labor, controls the department, and enforces and suggests laws involving unions, the workplace, and all other issues involving any form of business-person controversies.  Employers added only 156,000 jobs in August as the pace of hiring slowed, according to the Labor Department report Friday. The unemployment rate crept up to 4.4% from the 16-year low of 4.3% reached last month, as fewer adults reported that they had a job during the month. The Labor Department also revised down earlier estimates for job growth in both June and July by a total of 41,000 jobs, suggesting that the labor market is not quite as strong as it appeared to be a month ago. While Hurricane Harvey has shut down much of business in the Houston metropolitan area in the last week, the storm had no impact on this jobs reading, the Labor Department said.
