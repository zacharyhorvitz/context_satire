Tampax (a portmanteau of tampon and pack) is a brand of tampon currently owned by Procter & Gamble and sold in over 100 countries. The brand and product were created by Dr. Earle Haas, who filed a patent in the 1930s. The original product was designed from the start as flushable and biodegradeable.In 1937, Tampax worked with the McCann Erickson agency for its marketing campaigns and in 1949 Tampax appeared in more than 50 magazines. From 1930s to 1940s Tampax chose sportswomen as their brand ambassadors.During World War II, Tampax produced wound dressings for the military. In the final of the 2011 US Open against Samantha Stosur, Williams shouted "Come on!" as the Australian attempted to return a forehand Williams believed to be a winner. The chair umpire Eva Asderaki awarded the point to Stosur based on the USTA's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed." As the point was 30â€“40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. It was one of the first commercially sponsored films to be distributed to high schools. It was distributed with a booklet for teachers and students called Very Personally Yours that featured advertising of the Kotex brand of products, and discouraged the use of tampons, where the market was dominated by the Tampax brand of tampons from Tampax Inc.
