 Dozens of armed men seized the regional government administration buildings in Ukraine's southern Crimean region Thursday and raised the Russian flag in a challenge to the Eastern European country's new leaders. Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula with an ethnic Russian majority, is the last big bastion of opposition to the new political leadership in the capital, Kiev, after President Viktor Yanukovych's ouster Saturday. The seizure, coming a day after Russia ordered surprise military exercises on Ukraine's doorstep, has raised fears about the push and pull of opposing allegiances in a country sandwiched between Russia and the European Union. There's a broad divide between those who support developments in Kiev -- where parliament was voting on an interim West-leaning, national unity government Thursday -- and those who back Russia's continued influence in Crimea and across Ukraine.  Amid the chaos in Ukraine, an odd standoff played out Sunday at one military base on the country's Crimean peninsula. Several hundred men, wearing dark green camouflage uniforms without insignia, surrounded Ukraine's Perevalnoye base near the Crimean capital of Simferopol, according to a CNN crew that was there. But rather than the tense scene one might expect with two forces facing off, the men -- who were on foot and in a dozen or so vehicles -- walked peacefully near 15 Ukrainian soldiers standing guard at the base. Reporters have walked right up to the men in dark green and asked them who they are, but they have refused to respond.  The names involved in the escalating crisis in Ukraine -- Crimea, Sevastopol, Simferopol -- make it sound far away and far removed from America's allies and its interests. But the tensions there in fact hit very close to home for the United States. First, Ukraine is not a distant empire but an integral part of Europe. Its capital, Kiev, is just a short flight from cities Americans visit all the time: Rome, Frankfurt, Paris.
