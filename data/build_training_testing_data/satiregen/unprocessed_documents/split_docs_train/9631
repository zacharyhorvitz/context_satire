Pieter Willem Botha,  (Afrikaans pronunciation: ; 12 January 1916 â€“ 31 October 2006), commonly known as "P. W." and Die Groot Krokodil (Afrikaans for "The Great Crocodile"), was a South African politician. He served as the last Prime Minister from 1978 to 1984 and the first executive State President from 1984 to 1989. First elected to Parliament in 1948, Botha was an outspoken opponent of majority rule and international communism. However, his administration did make concessions towards political reform, whereas internal unrest saw widespread human rights abuses at the hands of the government. Michael Berrin (born May 6, 1967), best known by his stage name MC Serch, is an American hip hop MC and former member of 3rd Bass, and Non Phixion. 3rd Bass was an American hip-hop group that rose to fame in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was notable for being one of the first successful interracial hip-hop groups. They dissolved in 1992 and again in 2000 after a short reunion. The group released two studio albums in their initial career and both of them were certified gold by the RIAA.
