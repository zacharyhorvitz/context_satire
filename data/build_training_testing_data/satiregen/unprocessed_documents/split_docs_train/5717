 President Barack Obama will deliver remarks Tuesday morning urging action to avoid the automatic across-the-board budget cuts called the sequester, a White House official said. The cuts are scheduled to hit Friday, March 1 "if Congress fails to find a path forward on a balanced deficit reduction," the official said in a statement. The reductions could spur the loss of thousands of jobs. The president will urge Republicans to compromise on a balanced solution.  If you're expecting last minute action from Congress to avoid the March 1 spending cut deadline, think again. Congress isn't even in session this week, and lawmakers and aides from both parties say they don't expect anything to pass anytime soon. Why the lack of urgency? The cuts can be phased in over time, and leaders on both sides of the aisle know they can act after March 1 to undo any reductions in the months to come.  President Barack Obama warned Tuesday of diminished emergency services, longer airport security lines and other problems if Congress fails to reach agreement on avoiding the harshest impacts of automatic, across-the-board spending cuts set to begin March 1. With firefighters, police officers and other emergency responders standing behind him, Obama said that "people will lose their jobs" if the forced cuts are allowed to take effect. The cuts -- known as sequestration in Washington jargon -- won't help grow the economy or achieve jobs, Obama said, calling those goals the top priority of his administration. He listed a litany of possible impacts intended to inspire public outrage at the potential new reality caused by the spending cuts, such as fewer police and firefighters on the streets, reduced military readiness, less border security, and criminals going free because federal prosecutors will have to close cases.
