 President Trump's interactions with reporters have been limited lately. His schedule of interviews has been severely cut back. Maybe Thursday's phone call to "Fox & Friends" shows why. Trump called into his favorite morning show Thursday and almost shouted through the phone about a variety of grievances.  It began with the hosts of "Fox & Friends" beaming at him through the camera, like parents besotted with a first child. Then, obviously triggered by CNN's Town Hall with former FBI Director James Comey -- "I watched leaking, lying Comey last night. ... I hated to do it" -- President Donald Trump launched into a disjointed rant that revealed his mind to be a frightening and chaotic place.  President Donald Trump said Thursday morning that he predicted Jackson's nomination as the next secretary of Veterans Affairs was in serious trouble several days ago. "I even told him a day or two ago I saw where this was going," Trump told Fox News' "Fox & Friends" over the phone, later adding that "it's a disgrace." The President also said all the allegations against Jackson were false, saying the White House physician's opponents are "trying to destroy a man." Jackson withdrew his nomination Thursday morning, minutes before Trump called into the show for an interview.
