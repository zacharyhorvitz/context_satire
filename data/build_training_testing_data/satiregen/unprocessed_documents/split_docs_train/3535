Italian cuisine is food typical of Italy. It has developed through centuries of social and economic changes, with roots stretching to antiquity.Significant changes occurred with the colonization of the Americas and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, maize and sugar beet, this last introduced in quantity in the 18th century. Italian cuisine is known for its regional diversity, especially between the north and the south of the Italian peninsula. It offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and copied in the world. Mythology of Italy refers to the mythology of people living in Italy. Important Gods and Goddesses of Italian Mythology:Anteros is the Italian God of love and passion. Specifically, Anteros was the God of mutual love and would punish those who did not return love. Aradia is the Italian witch Goddess. Regional Italian (Italian: italiano regionale) is any regional variety of the Italian language. Such vernacular varieties and standard Italian exist along a sociolect continuum, and are not to be confused with the local indigenous languages of Italy that predate the national tongue or any regional variety thereof. The various forms of Regional Italian have phonological, morphological, syntactic, prosodic and lexical features which originate from the underlying substrate of the original language. The various Tuscan, Corsican and Central Italian dialects are, to some extent, the closest ones to Standard Italian in terms of linguistic features, since the latter is based on a somewhat polished form of Florentine.
