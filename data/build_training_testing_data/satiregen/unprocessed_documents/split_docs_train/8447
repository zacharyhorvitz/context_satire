West died from leukemia, in Los Angeles, California, on June 9, 2017. After his death, West's former Batman co-star and longtime friend, Burt Ward, released a statement; "This is a terribly unexpected loss of my lifelong friend, I will forever miss him. There are several fine actors who have portrayed Batman in films. In my eyes, there was only one real Batman that is and always will be Adam West. During the Batman television series, West's relationship with co-star Burt Ward was described as "problematic". He said, "Burt fell victim to making up stories to sell books. But in a way it was flattering, because he made me sound like King Kong." West also said that he played Batman "for laughs, but in order to do , one had to never think it was funny.
