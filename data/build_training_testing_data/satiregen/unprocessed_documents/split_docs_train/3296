 President Barack Obama called on Sunday for "calm reflection" following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. The president, in a written statement, acknowledged an emotionally charged climate but concluded that "we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken." Obama called Martin's death a tragedy for America. "I know this case has elicited strong passions.  In a hearing Tuesday outside of the jury's presence, attorneys in the George Zimmerman trial argued about whether jurors should see the defense's 3D re-creation of the altercation between the neighborhood watch captain and Trayvon Martin. The defense also wants jurors to hear about Martin's text messages, which reportedly show he had been in fights and was trying to purchase a gun. The judge recessed court right before 10 p.m. ET, saying she would wait until Wednesday morning to make decisions on both of these issues.  Not guilty. That's the verdict jurors reached this weekend in the trial of George Zimmerman, the Florida man who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. The decision might have capped the criminal case, but for Zimmerman and others, it also marked new chapters in their lives. Protests erupted in a number of U.S. cities, and reactions to the verdict poured in from all sides Sunday, including from the nation's highest office.
