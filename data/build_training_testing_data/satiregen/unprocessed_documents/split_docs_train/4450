Greer, a resident of Pasadena, California, from 1943, died in 2007 at Pasadena's Huntington Hospital after a battle with renal failure and heart disease. He never married and had no children. His body was transported back to his native state of Missouri, where it was buried in Peace Valley Cemetery in the town of Anderson. At around the same age, Burnett picked up the guitar. Overwhelmed by seeing the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, he started garage bands with Bruton. After graduating from high school in 1965, they spent most of their time at Sound City, a recording studio in the basement of a radio station where Burnett became fascinated by recording. He wrote and produced his first song, "Free Soul", with the Loose Ends under the name Jon T. Bone. Greer was born in Fairview, Missouri, the son of Bernice Irene (n√©e Dabbs), a speech teacher, and Randall Alexander Greer, a druggist. Greer moved to Anderson as an infant with his family. At the age of eight, he began acting in children's theater productions. He attended Drury University in Springfield, Missouri, where he was a member of Theta Kappa Nu.
