 Omarosa Manigault Newman's secret recordings from her time in the White House are an "unthinkable" security violation, said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on Monday. "It's a very serious and egregious security violation," Clapper said on CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront" of bringing a phone into the White House Situation Room. "It's sort of an honor system where everybody knows not to do that." The former contestant on "The Apprentice" and ex- aide to President Donald Trump made waves Sunday by airing a secret recording of her firing from the White House by chief of staff John Kelly on NBC's "Meet the Press."  We've entered a new plane of reality where the question of who secretly recorded President Donald Trump doing what without his knowledge has become an overriding theme of his presidency. Release of secret tapes almost derailed his presidential campaign. Trump's obsession with the unfounded idea he was being wiretapped by former President Barack Obama, and his concern about rumors he was secretly videotaped by the Russians, now feed strangely into the development that he *actually* was secretly recorded by his lawyer and at least one aide. And perhaps more incredible than the idea that heads of state would try to spy on each other is that the Trump era is indisputably a time in which a fix-it man dispatched to deal with alleged illicit affairs and a political staffer, both armed with iPhones, hit record while talking to their boss, who now happens to be the US President.  Secret tapes. Nondisclosure agreements. A lot of name calling. The revelations surrounding Omarosa Manigault Newman's new memoir, and the ensuing fallout, are underscoring a level of dysfunction many now see as just part of life under President Donald Trump.
