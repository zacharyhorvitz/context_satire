Opened in 1983, it is an independently funded, not-for-profit charity that is one of the leading tourism, wildlife and conservation attractions in Ireland. The park had an attendance of 455,559 visitors in 2017, making it the eleventh most popular paid attraction in Ireland for that year.The park is home to nearly 30 mammal and 50 bird species.

In "the nation's salad bowl," as California's Central Valley is often called, fresh produce grows in abundance. But for many area residents, healthy food is out of reach. "Here we are in this agriculturally rich area and yet people who live here and work here are hungry, are impoverished," said Sarah Ramirez, an educator who grew up in the area. "(Some) are working in the fields that feed the entire country and then they don't have the resources to support them and their health.
