 The Republican Senate takeover is a hot conversation topic in Washington, but outside the nation's capital, Americans aren't feeling much of a change as the new Congress gavels into session on Tuesday. About 6-in-10 Americans believe the new Congress won't get more done compared to the previous Congress, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday. And about half of Americans surveyed said they don't expect Congress to be more or less responsive this time around. On the flip side, 37% of Americans have faith the new Congress will get more done than the last and just 30% of Americans think Congress will be more responsive to the public in the new session.  The tea party's latest failed revolt against House Speaker John Boehner underscored one of the movement's biggest problems heading into the new Congress. They are rebels with no clear cause. It's an issue that's bedeviled the tea party since its inception in 2010: They lack a central planning organization, a structure and a long-term strategic vision. And Boehner, with a shrewd command of all three, was already flexing those muscles Tuesday, doling out early retribution to two lawmakers that opposed him by removing them from committee spots. The House Rules Committee held a hearing to write the rules governing the debate over impeachment on December 17. The first of three votes was on the rules governing debate: 228 to 197, with all Republicans and two Democrats voting no. This was followed by six hours of debate. One of the highlights of this contentious event was Barry Loudermilk (R-Georgia) comparing the impeachment inquiry of President Trump to the trial of Jesus Christ, saying that the Christian savior was treated far better by the authorities.
