The Lebanese pound (Arabic: ليرة لبنانية‎ lira libnaniyya; French: livre libanaise; sign: ل.ل.‎, ISO 4217: LBP) is the currency of Lebanon. It used to be divided into 100 piastres (or qirsh) but high inflation in the Lebanese Civil War has eliminated the need for  subdivisions. The plural form of lira, as used on the currency, is either lirat (ليرات) or the same, whilst there were four forms for qirsh: the dual qirshān (قرشان), the plural qurush (قروش) used with numbers 3–10, the accusative singular qirshan (قرشا) used with 11–99, or the genitive singular qirshi (قرش) used with multiples of 100. In both cases, the number determines which plural form is used.
