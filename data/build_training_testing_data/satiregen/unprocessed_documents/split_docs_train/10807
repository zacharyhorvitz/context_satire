The major Canadian production facility for Quaker Oats is located in Peterborough, Ontario. The factory was first established as the American Cereal Company in 1902 on the shores of the Otonabee River during that city's period of industrialization. At the time, the city was known as "The Electric City" due to its hydropower resources, attracting many companies to the site to take advantage of this source. The Trent–Severn Waterway also promised to provide an alternate shipping route from inland areas around the city, although it appears this was never used in practice. Located in the middle portion of the city on Southeast Cedar Street, the single-story Brookwood Elementary opened in 1953 and was named after the area. It was the first building in the district to be built using prefabricated forms, and had to be expanded in 1957. The building now totals 40,641 square feet (3,775.7 m2) of space. The school's mascot is the bobcat, and enrollment is 448 students. In 1908, Quaker Oats introduced the first in a series of cookie recipes on the box. In 1911, Quaker Oats purchased the Great Western Cereal Company. The iconic cylindrical package made its first appearance in 1915. Later that year, Quaker offered the first cereal box premium to buyers.
