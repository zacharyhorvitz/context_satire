 Death rates have been dropping for Americans of almost every age for decades now. A study of centenarians, Americans 100 years and older, suggests that they are joining the ranks, as their death rates started to decline in 2008. Using data from the United States Census Bureau and death certificates filed in the United States, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined the death rate and causes of death in this oldest-of-the-old population between 2000 and 2014. The study reported that, although Americans in their very golden years are still rare, the population has grown by 44% in recent years, from 50,281 in 2000 to 72,197 in 2014. At the turn of the 20th century, Illinois had a population of nearly 5Â million. Many people from other parts of the country were attracted to the state by employment caused by the expanding industrial base. Whites were 98% of the state's population. Bolstered by continued immigration from southern and eastern Europe, and by the African-American Great Migration from the South, Illinois grew and emerged as one of the most important states in the union. Illinois State University (ISU) is a public university in Normal, Illinois, United States. Founded in 1857 as Illinois State Normal University, it is the oldest public university in Illinois.
