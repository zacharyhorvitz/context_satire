 There is no sense of worry in Hillary Clinton or her campaign aides a day before Iowans decide who to caucus for on Monday night. Polls show Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tightening the Democratic presidential primary race, but the former secretary of state and her husband -- former President Bill Clinton -- appear to be at peace with how her campaign has been run and her standing 24 hours before the caucuses. While most Clinton aides didn't expect the race would be this close, the same aides say they feel like a win is in sight. "We've had an amazing grassroots organizing effort," Clinton told CNN on Saturday.  Bernie Sanders said Tuesday that he clearly needs a strong voter turnout to win in Iowa on Monday, but he has no expectation of reaching the high-water mark set by then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008. "Obama in 2008 ran a campaign which is really going to stay in the history books. It was an unbelievable campaign. In places they ran out of ballots, as I understand," Sanders told reporters after a meeting with the United Steelworkers in Des Moines, Iowa.  Donald Trump spent his Sunday on the stump ripping his political rivals and urging his voters to trek to the caucuses, all the while predicting victory in the Iowa caucuses taking place in just eight days. Speaking to supporters in a crowded high school gym, Trump focused the brunt of his attacks on former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose campaign launched attack ads against Trump, and on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is neck-and-neck with Trump in the latest Iowa polls. Trump's speech came after he attended Sunday church services at the First Presbyterian Church in Muscatine.
