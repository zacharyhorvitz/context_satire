The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) is an international, leaderless resistance that engages in direct action in pursuit of animal rights. Activists see themselves as a modern-day Underground Railroad, removing animals from laboratories and farms, destroying facilities, arranging safe houses, veterinary care and operating sanctuaries where the animals subsequently live. Critics have labelled them as terrorists.Active in over 40 countries, ALF cells claim to operate clandestinely, consisting of small groups of friends and sometimes just one person, which makes the movement difficult for the authorities to monitor. However despite claims of being clandestine the ALF operate a Press office with named contacts who may be held to account.
