 I received an interesting call from my oldest daughter earlier this week. Kathryn ( "Casey" to everyone but me) is a dedicated inner-city elementary school teacher in Denver whose self-described progressive politics are far to the left of my own more centrist approach. Kathryn happily advised me that she had finally found a controversial news story about which both she and I might agree. This would be a rare event -- our only consistent shared views relate to the enduring superiority of classic rock. Hoda Muthana (born October 28, 1994) is a New Jersey-born woman who left the United States to join ISIS in November 2014. She surrendered in January 2019 to coalition forces fighting ISIS in Syria and has been denied access back to the United States per a judge ruling as she is not an American citizen. At the time of her birth, her father was a diplomat for Yemen. President Trump instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to not allow her back into the country. Pompeo released a press statement that read: "Ms. Hoda Muthana is not a U.S. citizen and will not be admitted into the United States. She does not have any legal basis, no valid U.S. passport, no right to a passport, nor any visa to travel to the United States. We continue to strongly advise all U.S. citizens not to travel to Syria."
