 FBI agents raided a home of President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort last month, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The agents seized materials in Manafort's home as part of the ongoing Russia investigation led by Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the source said. "FBI agents executed a search warrant at one of Mr. Manafort's residences. Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well," Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Manafort, told CNN. Downing represents Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign former campaign chairman Paul Manafort in the currently ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, as well as possible collusion between Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government. In 2017, former FBI director Robert Mueller was selected by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to serve as the special prosecutor overseeing the Special Counsel investigation following the dismissal of James Comey by President Trump. On July 26, 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation executed a no-knock search warrant on Manafort's northern Virginia home a day after the former campaign manager had met with the Senate Intelligence Committee. After the raid, Manafort switched legal firms to Miller & Chevalier, hiring Downing in August.  President Donald Trump said he was "surprised" that the FBI conducted an early morning raid of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort's home last month. "You know, they do that very seldom, so I was surprised to see it. I was very, very surprised to see it," Trump said from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Thursday, according to pool reports. "I thought it was a very, very strong signal, or whatever."
