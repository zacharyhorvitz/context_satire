Jason Friedberg (born October 13, 1971) and Aaron Seltzer (born January 12, 1974) are an American-Canadian film director and screenwriter team known for making parody movies that have received extremely unfavorable reviews, but have generally done well at the box office. They have written/directed films such as Spy Hard, Date Movie, Disaster Movie and Vampires Suck. The duo have often been strongly criticized for their style of humor, regarded as lazily capitalizing on passing trends and mistaking scatological humor, stereotypes and fleeting references for jokes. Their work has often been nominated for Golden Raspberry Awards, though the two have never won one themselves.
