 With Kim Jong Un still out of sight, North Korean officials have gone on a publicity blitz, making a rare move to take questions at the United Nations, arranging human rights talks with the European Union and taking a high-level trip to South Korea. The overtures come at a time when its human rights record has received increased scrutiny. Pyongyang's charm offensive has raised questions of what the regime seeks and what could be happening in the country's inner circle. While Ri Tong Il, the North Korean deputy ambassador, declined to respond to questions about Kim's health on Tuesday, he gave some clues to what may be behind the country's rare willingness to take reporters' questions.  Events in North Korea have left the world wondering: Where's leader Kim Jong Un and is he still running perhaps the most isolated country on Earth? Some analysts speculate Kim may have been ousted by an old guard from the era of his late father, whose 2011 death put the son in power. First, Kim Jong Un gained a lot of weight. Then he developed a limp. The BBC reported that the Korean Central News Agency said people were convulsing with pain and despair at their loss, but would unite behind his successor Kim Jong-un. They said that all party members, military men, and the public should faithfully follow the leadership of comrade Jong-un and protect and further strengthen the unified front of the party, military, and the public.
