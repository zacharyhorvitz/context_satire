Stern began his WNBC program in September 1982, working from 4â€“8 pm. Concerned about its corporate image and his risque personality, management told Stern to avoid discussions of a sexual and religious nature. Within his first month at the station, Stern was suspended for several days for a controversial segment known as "Virgin Mary Kong." The skit featured a new video game by God in which a group of men chase the Virgin Mary around a singles bar in Jerusalem. The Tapes Team produces specials out of the archives of the Howard Stern Show, such as "Howard Stern: The Peacock Years", "The Gayest Week Ever", "The History of Howard Stern", as well as the daily and weekend editions of Sternthology. Members of this team do not appear on the air. IWHC attended the 1994 United Nations International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo where they asked for the inclusion for access to contraception, safe abortion, maternity care, better access to women's health services and comprehensive sex education. In preparation for the conference, Dunlop and 15 colleagues developed a set of guidelines called "Women's Declaration on Population Policies," which focused on women's rights in family planning. The "Women's Declaration" was eventually reviewed and finalized with the help of 100 different women's organizations around the world. The "Women's Declaration" was adopted by the conference in Cairo.
