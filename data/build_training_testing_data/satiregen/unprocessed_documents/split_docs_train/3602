In 2007, the Carlton University Art Gallery held a solo exhibition for Lapointe titled, La Perle. The exhibit engaged Lapointe’s interest of sound, optics, and museum history, with 23 individual works of painting, drawings, and found-objects. The installation of works, drawn from images of botany, medical, art-historical sources and encyclopedias, were intended to challenge practices of museology and methods of display. At the end of their 15-year relationship in 1995, Fleming and Lapointe had a retrospective, titled Studiolo, incorporating the bulk of research, processes, and discursive and creative projects that they shared. The show was exhibited at the Museum d’Art Contemporain in 1997, and later at the Art Gallery of Windsor 1998 invited by curator at the time, Helga Pakasaar. Accompanied with the exhibition was an associated book, also titled Studiolo. The book showcases the philosophical, historical, and aesthetic frameworks associated to the exhibition, and is located in Artextes Editions of 1997. In 2011, the Pierre-Francois Oulette Art Contemporain exhibited 7 selected paintings from Lapointe’s series La Pierre Patiente (The Patient Stone). Lapointe used acupuncture needles, formally intended to reestablish a human internal balance of energy, to address the tension between humans’ link to the environment and other species. These works were painted on glass with phosphorescent pigments (a technique seen in earlier works), to suggest the shift between light and darkness, and the fragility of memory and disembodiment.
