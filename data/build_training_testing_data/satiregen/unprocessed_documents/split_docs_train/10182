In July 2017, Marshall became a favourite to take over the role of The Doctor from Peter Capaldi in the BBC's long running hit sci-fi series Doctor Who, but the role ultimately went to Jodie Whittaker who became the first female actress to portray The Doctor, a pre-appointment condition originated by Chris Chibnall of his becoming the show's showrunner. In 1970, Garry Marshall became the executive producer of the television series The Odd Couple. The following year, Marshall was added to the permanent cast to play a secretary, Myrna, and held the role for four years. In Marshall's final appearance on The Odd Couple, her character married her boyfriend, Sheldn ("they left the "o" off the birth certificate", she explains), played by Rob Reiner, her real-life husband. The episode included Marshall's real-life siblings, Garry and Ronny, as Myrna's brother and sister. Marshall first learned how to debate from his father, who took Marshall and his brother to watch court cases; they would later debate what they had seen. The family also debated current events after dinner. Marshall said that although his father never told him to become a lawyer, he "turned me into one. He did it by teaching me to argue, by challenging my logic on every point, by making me prove every statement I made."
