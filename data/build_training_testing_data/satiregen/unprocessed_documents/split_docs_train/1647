 Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will face off on Sunday at the next Democratic debate, moderated by CNN. The debate will take place in Flint, Michigan, a city that gained national attention after it was discovered that much of the population was suffering from lead poisoning due to its contaminated water supply. Flint switched its water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River in 2014 to cut costs, but the corrosive water from the river ate away at iron and lead pipes. The city switched its water supply back five months ago, but has only begun replacing its lead service lines. Sanders made his first national appearance following his heart attack on October 15 at the Democratic debate, at which he said, "I'm healthy, I'm feeling great." When asked how he would reassure voters about his health and ability to take on the duties of the presidency, he said, "We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people." It was noted that he was "lively and sharp at the debate."  Allies of Hillary Clinton are calling out Bernie Sanders for snapping at the former secretary of state in a pair of tense exchanges during the Democratic presidential debate on Sunday night in Flint, Michigan. "Excuse me, I'm talking," Sanders told Clinton as she attempted to interrupt his argument about the Wall Street and auto bailouts. Correct the Record, an independent group that backs Clinton's campaign, emailed the clip to reporters, describing it as Sanders' "Rick Lazio moment." That's a reference to former New York senate candidate Rick Lazio, then a Republican congressman, who in a 2000 debate with Clinton walked across the stage demanding she sign a campaign finance reform pledge.
