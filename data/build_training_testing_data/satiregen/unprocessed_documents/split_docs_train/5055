The National Archives building holds the original copies of the three main formative documents of the United States and its government: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. These are displayed to the public in the main chamber of the National Archives, which is called the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom. The museum services of the National Archives, fully entitled as the "Legislative Archives, Presidential Libraries, and Museum Services" oversees the Presidential library system and also maintains the "Center for Legislative Archives" which is concerned solely with records of the United States Congress, including the original copies of all constitutional amendments. A special branch known as the "Charters of Freedom" is responsible for the upkeep and storage of the actual United States Constitution and other critical historical documents located in the National Archives Rotunda in Washington, DC. The Archivist of the United States is the chief official overseeing the operation of the National Archives and Records Administration. The Archivist not only maintains the official documentation of the passage of amendments to the U.S. Constitution by state legislatures, but has the authority to declare when the constitutional threshold for passage has been reached, and therefore when an act has become an amendment.
