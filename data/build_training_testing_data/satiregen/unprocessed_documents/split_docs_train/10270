A major benefactor to the Sisters of Mercy was the Connor (O’Connor) family. Daniel Connor, an Irish Catholic, had been a former convict who came to Toodyay as an itinerant peddler. When the new town of Newcastle was established in 1860 he set up a store, and built up a personal fortune through acquiring properties and businesses. He became one of the biggest landowners in central Perth. The first painting was by Eugeniusz Kazimirowski, under the supervision of Faustina and her confessor, Michał Sopoćko, in Vilnius. After completion in 1934, the painting hung in the Bernardine Sisters' convent near the church of St. Michael, where Sopoćko was a rector. In her diary, sister Faustina notes that Jesus told her to inform her confessor that the proper place for the painting was in a church, not in the hallway of a convent. The first public exposition of the Kazimierowski rendition was on 26–28 April 1935, at the church of the Gate of Dawn in Vilnius. In influenza epidemics, some churches suspend the giving of communion under the form of wine, for fear of spreading the disease. This is in full accord with Catholic Church belief that communion under the form of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. However, the same measure has also been taken by churches that normally insist on the importance of receiving communion under both forms. This was done in 2009 by the Church of England.
