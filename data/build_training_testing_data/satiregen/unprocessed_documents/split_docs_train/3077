Hans Meyer (born 21 July 1925) is a South African actor born to German parents. In Britain, he is known for his portrayal of Hauptmann Franz Ulmann in the television series Colditz (1972–74). Meyer was born in Paulpietersburg KwaZulu. He worked initially as a model where he posed for book covers until a friend in Germany working for an advertising agency lined up his first work as an actor, a television advert for Puschkin Vodka. In 1889 Meyer returned to Kilimanjaro with the celebrated Austrian mountaineer Ludwig Purtscheller for a third attempt. Their climbing team included two local headmen, nine porters, a cook, and a guide. After Meyer and Purtscheller pushed to near the crater rim on October 3 before retreating to the base of Kibo, they reached the summit on the southern rim of the crater on Purtscheller's 40th birthday, October 6, 1889. Meyer named this summit - now known as Uhuru Point- "Kaiser Wilhelm Spitze". Hans Meyer (1913–2009) was a German-born teacher at Bunce Court School in the County of Kent, England. He taught at the school from 1934 until it closed in 1948. In 1940, Meyer and several others from the school were forced to go to a British internment camp. Learning that several of his pupils were being deported to a camp in Australia, Meyer volunteered to accompany them, ending up on the HMT Dunera.
