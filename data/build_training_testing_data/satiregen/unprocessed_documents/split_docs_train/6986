In February 2018, Luner was accused of drugging and filming a sexual encounter with Anthony Oliver, who had been a 16-year-old boy at the time of the alleged conduct in 1998. The lawsuit alleged that Luner had offered him whiskey and methamphetamines. In addition to the television series tie-in, promotion consisted of live presentations and television advertisements which starred Brooke Theiss as the live model. Commercials would typically feature the Maxie doll at school or various other activities, then switch to Theiss as the "real life" Maxie, which Hasbro vice president of public relations and promotions, Wayne Charness, described at the time as "innovative advertising for a fashion doll". By October 1988, sales of Maxie were said to be strong, with Charness reporting, "She's right on target with our projections for the first year. We certainly look forward to Maxie to be around for a long time." He married Colleen Sterns, an interior decorator, in 1975 at The Church on the Way. They have two children, Cameron and Ashley. Reagan and his wife live in the Toluca Lake area of Los Angeles.
