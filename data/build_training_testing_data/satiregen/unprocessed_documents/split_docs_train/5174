 President Barack Obama has a message for Donald Trump â€” being president is tougher than being on a reality show and the American people are too "sensible" to elect him. "I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president," Obama said at a news conference in California after a meeting with southeast Asian leaders. "And the reason is that I have a lot of faith in the American people. Being president is a serious job.  The days of Hillary Clinton subtly separating herself from President Barack Obama on one policy or another are over: she won the debate in Milwaukee by lavishly and repeatedly praising Obama -- and delivered a sharp rebuke to Sen. Bernie Sanders for criticizing the President. "The kind of criticism we've heard from Senator Sanders about our President, I expect from Republicans," she said in the closing minutes of the debate. "I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama." Clinton's sudden bombshell was delivered so late in the proceedings that Sanders had no choice but to use part of his closing statement to respond.  President Barack Obama vowed on Tuesday to name an "indisputably" qualified Supreme Court nominee and lashed out at Republicans who he said demand a strict interpretation of the Constitution --  except regarding his right to propose a new justice. The President staked out a tough position after Republicans warned he would not get a vote on his eventual nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The GOP is arguing that filling the seat on the nation's highest bench should be left to the next president. "The Constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now," Obama said during his first press conference since Scalia's passing over the weekend.
