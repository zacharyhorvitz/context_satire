Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness (born Thelma Morgan, 23 August 1904 â€“ 29 January 1970) was a mistress of King Edward VIII while he was still the Prince of Wales; she preceded Wallis Simpson in his affections (for whose sake Edward abdicated and became the Duke of Windsor). She was the maternal aunt of the author, fashion designer and socialite Gloria Vanderbilt. During most of Furness's relationship with the prince, she was married to a British nobleman, Marmaduke Furness, 1st Viscount Furness. That marriage ended the year before her relationship with the Prince ended.
