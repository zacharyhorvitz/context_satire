 The Federal Reserve was back in the limelight Wednesday but there was little new news. The minutes from the Fed's June meeting showed many of the 12 Fed voting officials said they need to see further improvement in the job market before they'd be willing to gradually start winding down the stimulus program. U.S. stocks initially bounced but returned to the breakeven line soon after as investors realized the comments were closely in line with Fed chairman Ben Bernanke's announcement last month. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1%, the S&P 500 finished flat and the Nasdaq gained 0.5%.  Stocks look set to make gains Thursday on the back of dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, bringing record highs within reach. U.S. stock futures were all up by roughly 1% as markets around the world rallied. European markets also gained, by less than 1%, in midday trading and major Asian markets ended with big gains. The global rise in equities is being attributed to comments late Wednesday by Bernanke, who said monetary policy would remain "highly accommodative" for the foreseeable future.  The stock market's double-digit gains are here to stay, but don't expect another huge rally during the second half of the year. "The market's going to be taking a bit of a breather this half," said Gene Goldman, director of research at Cetera Financial. According to nearly 30 investment strategists and money managers surveyed by CNNMoney, the S&P 500 should end the year with a 14% gain at 1,620. That's a more optimistic target than what experts predicted at the start of 2013, or even in April, when the market was up 10% for the year.
