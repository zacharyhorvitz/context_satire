John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter said, "Throughout, gags are cartoonishly broad and afforded so little time for setup and delivery we seem to be watching less a story than a catalog of tossed-out material." Andrew Barker of Variety said, "Among the slackest, laziest, least movie-like movies released by a major studio in the last decade, "Grown Ups 2" is perhaps the closest Hollywood has yet come to making "Ow, My Balls!" seem like a plausible future project." Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film one out of four stars, saying, "The temptation arises to say something nice about "Grown Ups 2" just because it doesn't cause injury. In October 2009, UPS became the first small-package carrier to offer customers the chance to buy carbon offsets to neutralize the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transport of their packages. Although initially only available on ups.com and to high-volume shippers, they are now widely available through UPS shipping systems and UPS Ready third-party shipping systems. Prior to the buyout of Overnite, FedEx had recently purchased LTL companies American Freightways (on the east coast) and Viking Freight (on the west coast), creating FedEx Freight. UPS spokesman Norman Black told industry news outlet FleetOwner the LTL industry had become attractive due to the increasing economic and strategic attractiveness of the sector: “ attractive because of consolidations and watching the survivors grow and flourish as they’ve been improving operating ratios and developing new types of services customers respond to – especially in time-definite delivery options... That is what Overnite has been forefront of and that’s a huge trend in commerce now. Certainly we see it in the package world."
