 Attorney General Jeff Sessions says he plans to continue in his job despite President Donald Trump's comments that he'd have picked someone else had he known Sessions would recuse himself from the Justice Department's Russia investigation. "We love this job. We love this department, and I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate," he told reporters Thursday. In a New York Times interview published Wednesday, Trump second-guessed his decision to nominate Sessions, an Alabama Republican who was the first sitting senator to back the real estate mogul's presidential bid.  President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was "disappointed" with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but declined to say whether he would fire him or if he believed Sessions should resign. "I am disappointed in the attorney general. He should not have recused himself," Trump said during a joint news conference with the Lebanese prime minister, hours after firing off his latest missive targeting Sessions. "If he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office and I would have quite simply picked someone else."  If Jeff Sessions is fired or quits, could he get his old job back? In Alabama, they've already thinking about it. Before he was presidentially humiliated, Sessions, the US attorney general, was elected four times to the US Senate by the people of Alabama. The last time in 2014, Sessions was unopposed.
