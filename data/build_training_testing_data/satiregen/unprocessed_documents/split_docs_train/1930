Gordon also had problems with turnovers (4.46 per 48 minutes; sixth in the league in 2004â€“05), however, and an overall lack of stamina in his rookie season. He remarked, "More than anything, I just want to come back  in better shape. ... A lot of this game is about conditioning and how long you can give your best performance." Gordon also revealed that he was in the process of designing an energy drink called BG7, an allusion to his initials and jersey number. The following year, Gordon began competing full-time in the Winston Cup Series. He opened the season with a win in the Gatorade Twin 125's race, while also recording his first-career pole position at the fall Charlotte race, and concluded 1993 with a 14th-place points finish and the Rookie of the Year Award. Gordon's early success in the sport reshaped the paradigm and eventually gave younger drivers an opportunity to compete in NASCAR. However, during the season, many doubted Gordon's ability to compete at such a level at such a young age because of his tendency to push the cars too hard and crash. MacDougal's 2006 performance earned him a new three-year deal with the White Sox, but he was not able to carry his success from the end of the 2006 season into 2007. MacDougal finished 2007 with an ERA about 6.00, spent more time on the DL with right-shoulder inflammation, and was actually optioned to the team's Triple-A affiliate at one point.
