In Morocco, Keith Richards saw Jones assaulting Pallenberg, and pulled her away and then took her back to England, where she moved in with him. She and Richards began a relationship that lasted until 1980, although they never married. Richards' lifestyle was not conducive to fatherhood, Pallenberg later explained. She was trying to raise their two young children but Richards was up all night and slept all day. The popular press focused on the relationship between Jagger and Richards. Graham Smith in the Daily Mail said, "Unsurprisingly, The Rolling Stones guitarist isn't entirely complimentary towards his childhood friend. But nobody was expecting him to decimate Jagger's status as a legendary ladies' man by revealing the singer has a "tiny todger", before quoting Richards, "Because I love the man dearly; I'm still his mate. But he makes it very difficult to be his friend." In the mid-1960s Linda became well connected culturally in the early days of "Swinging London". She was photographed by David Bailey and, together with Shiela Klein, partner of the Rolling Stones' manager Andrew Oldham, was at the heart of a bohemian community in London's West Hampstead. She formed relationships with Keith Richards of the Stones and, later in New York, Jimi Hendrix, but drifted into drug dependency. Richards appears to have been instrumental in Alan Keith's going out to America to find his daughter.
