 John King is an avid traveler and is joining Gowalla, the location based mobile and web service, to share his experiences from the road. Last year, John visited all 50 states following President Barack Obama’s inauguration and sat down with residents in local diners to hear their stories and discuss the issues most important to them. Just like the people with whom John spoke, each diner had a story—from Bud’s Drive In in Idaho known for burgers and huckleberry milkshakes to Stacy’s Restaurant in Fort Riley, Kansas that serves active duty military members and veterans. So John, along with his field producers Laura Bernardini and Tasha Diakides, compiled their favorite diners and locations in all 50 states for you to visit, and along the way try some of their favorite dishes and learn a few fun political facts.

Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita, with its most populated county and largest employment center being Johnson County. Kansas is bordered by Nebraska on the north; Missouri on the east; Oklahoma on the south; and Colorado on the west. Kansas is named after the Kansas River, which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks.
