All songs are credited as "written and arranged by Ted Nugent", except "Hey Baby", which is credited as "written and arranged by Derek St. Holmes". In Martin Popoff's book, Epic Ted Nugent, Nugent admits that "Stranglehold", was co-written by Rob Grange, who never received a royalty share. Derek St. Holmes claims the album was co-written by the whole band, and that Nugent took sole credit as a way to not pay them royalties. "Stranglehold" – a guitar-driven track, over eight minutes long - set the stage for Nugent's career, its guitar solo having been recorded in a single take. “I used delays to create this really wild guitar duet with Ted," said producer Tom Werman. "It was like two guys were playing. I sent it off to Ted for his approval. Many of the initiatives that were successful at the Apple Stores, for instance the "thought that people would show up in stores because they were fun places to hang out, and that they would buy things listed at full-but-fair price" did not work for the J.C. Penney brand and ended up alienating its customers who were used to heavy discounting. By eliminating the thrill of pursuing markdowns, the “fair and square every day” pricing strategy disenfranchised JC Penney's traditional customer base. Johnson himself was said "to have a disdain for JC Penney’s traditional customer base." When shoppers weren't reacting positively to the disappearance of coupons and sales, Johnson didn't blame the new policies.
