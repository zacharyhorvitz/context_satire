Many fast food chains in the West Bank such as McDonald's have trouble getting franchises without going through the Israeli franchisee. KFC however did not feel this was needed and allowed the first Palestinian owned location to open in Ramallah in 2012. As of 2016, KFC has locations in four cities in the Palestinian Authority controlled area, Hebron, Bethlehem, Jenin, and three separate outlets in Ramallah: the Ersal Branch (Bacri), Plaza Mall Branch and Masyoun Branch. In 2013 the New York Times reported that KFC was being smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. KFC was one of the first fast-food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in England, Mexico and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, KFC experienced mixed success domestically, as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business. In the early 1970s, KFC was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein, which was taken over by the R.J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate, which later sold the chain to PepsiCo. The chain continued to expand overseas, and in 1987 KFC became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China. During the summer 2018, KFC announced interest in reopening franchises in Israel, and sent a delegation to meet with potential franchisees, stating that they have strong confidence in the Israeli market, especially the Anglo community. This would mark KFC's fourth attempt at entering the Israeli market. KFC announced their hopes at opening 100 branches in Israel. In February 2019, KFC began hiring for their re-opening in Israel.
