During the 2016 presidential campaign, Paul Ryan was reported to have considered a possible presidential bid for the 2020 election, if President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence do not seek re-election. This could make Ryan the first president from Wisconsin as well as the second House Speaker to later serve as president, the first being James K. Polk in 1845. Additionally Ryan would also be the first person since Bob Dole to be nominated for both president and vice president two different elections (Dole was the vice presidential nominee in 1976 and the presidential nominee in 1996).  Gov. Bob McDonnell (R-VA), the chair of Republican Governors Association and Romney campaign surrogate, was the one who introduced Mitt Romney on Saturday when he announced he chose Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) as his running mate. He tells Soledad on "Starting Point" why he thinks Ryan was a good choice for Romney. "I think the honesty of these two when it comes to addressing the problems that face the country," Gov.  The 2012 presidential campaign returned its focus to Iowa on Monday as President Barack Obama and Rep. Paul Ryan, the newly minted GOP vice presidential candidate, stumped in the electoral battleground. Elsewhere, Mitt Romney continued his campaign bus tour at events in Florida and Vice President Joe Biden was slated to rally in North Carolina, making Monday the first day all four candidates vying for president and vice president hit the trail. The focus for all four remained on Ryan, who was unveiled as Romney's running mate at a Saturday morning event in Virginia. A CNN/ORC poll taken at the beginning of August showed a majority of Americans were unfamiliar with Ryan, leaving an opening for both Democrats and Republicans to offer their own definitions of the seven-term Wisconsin congressman.
