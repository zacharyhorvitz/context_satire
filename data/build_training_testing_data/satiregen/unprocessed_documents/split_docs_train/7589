Etoile is an unincorporated community in  Barren County, Kentucky, United States. The Etoile Post Office  closed in 1988. Previously called Caney Fork, the post office opened in 1886 was named Etoile, Étoile being the French for star, for unknown reasons. Danseur Étoile (for men) or Danseuse Étoile (for women), literally "star dancer", is the highest rank a dancer can reach at the Paris Opera Ballet. It is equivalent to the title "Principal dancer" in Anglo-Saxon countries or to the title "Primo Ballerino" or "Prima Ballerina" in Italian. The term of "étoile" had been used to designate the best soloists of the Paris Opera Ballet since the 19th century, but it was only in 1940 that the ballet master, Serge Lifar, decided to officialize the title at the top of the company's hierarchy. Unlike all lower ranks in the Ballet (Quadrille, Coryphée, Sujet, Premier Danseur), promotion to Étoile does not depend on success in the annual competitive examinations. Étoile ("star") is a French naval schooner used as a training vessel. She was launched on 8 February 1932. She is a replica of a type of fishing vessel which was used until 1935 off Iceland. She has a sister ship, Belle Poule.
