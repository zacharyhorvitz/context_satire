LaHood announced his plans to step down as transportation secretary at the end of Obama's first term in 2013. He did not seek any public office after that, and instead entered the private sector. On January 29, 2013, LaHood announced he would resign as the Secretary of the Department of Transportation upon the confirmation of his successor by the United States Senate. President Obama nominated Anthony Foxx, the incumbent mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, to succeed LaHood. Brinegar was nominated to the post of United States Secretary of Transportation by Richard Nixon. Dr. Brinegar was the third person to take the post of Secretary of Transportation and followed John A. Volpe, a former governor in Massachusetts. Brinegar had never held political office before taking this post, but cited his education and experience as a consumer as credentials that made him suitable for the job. He was quoted “I ‘ve flown a million miles in the last seven years, and I’ve sat on the Harbor Freeway for hours in traffic jams”, implying that his firsthand knowledge of the issues regarding transportation would help him find effective solutions. In a statement to the Senate panel considering his nomination, Geithner called the tax issues "careless", "avoidable", and "unintentional" errors, and he said he wanted to "apologize to the committee for putting you in the position of having to spend so much time on these issues." Geithner testified that he used TurboTax to prepare his own return and that the tax errors are his own responsibility. The Washington Post quoted a tax expert who said that TurboTax has not been programmed to handle self-employment taxes when the user identifies himself as being employed. Geithner said at the hearing that he was always under the impression that he was an employee, not a self-employed contractor, while he served as director of the Policy Development and Review Department of IMF.
