On January 23, 2016, it was reported that Bloomberg was again considering a presidential run, as an independent candidate in the 2016 election, if Bernie Sanders got the Democratic party nomination. This was the first time he had officially confirmed he was considering a run. Bloomberg supporters believed that Bloomberg could run as a centrist and capture many voters who were dissatisfied with the likely Democratic and Republican nominees. However, on March 7, Bloomberg announced he would not be running for president. Bloomberg said that he is open to spending 1 billion dollars to support the Democratic candidate in the presidential election, even if it will be Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. He said that he will not run ads against his rivals in the Democratic primaries.  Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg kicked off his presidential campaign on Monday here in Virginia with a blunt case: Without me in the race, President Donald Trump is more likely to get reelected. It's the closest Bloomberg has come to directly saying that the candidates in the current Democratic field are unable to defeat Trump. But the subtext was obvious on Monday. "I think that there is a greater risk of having Donald Trump reelected than there was before," Bloomberg said, reflecting on his decision to mount a late entry bid to the presidency.
