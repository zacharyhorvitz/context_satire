In 1921, outside Winden, two men are building a passage into the cave that would later be used as the portal. One of them, a young Noah, kills the other with a pick-axe on suspicions that he "lost  faith". The younger Noah is guided by his older self, a member of a group of time travellers called Sic Mundus, led by the disfigured and mysterious Adam, who tells the older Noah to retrieve the missing pages of Claudia's diary in preparation for an "apocalypse" that will occur on 27 June 2020. Doodlebug was written, directed, shot and edited by Christopher Nolan. He had written the script while studying English literature at University College London (UCL). The three-minute short was filmed on a negligible budget in 1997 using black-and-white 16mm film. Nolan shot the film over a weekend, a technique he used the following year with his first full-length release Following, with two or three-minute excerpts being shot over the two days. The character Isaac Clarke received mostly positive reviews from critics. PlayStation Universe described him as a "corpse-slaying badass," saying: "starting off as the mute hero of the original Dead Space, Clarke was finally given a voice and personality in the sequel, becoming a standout character in his own right". They added: "his willingness to help others and strong morals makes him an ideal partner", and stated his best characteristic to survive is his adaptability. GamesRadar ranked Isaac, who has "a cool demeanor, and an even cooler suit of futuristic armor," as the 22nd "most memorable, influential, and badass" protagonist in games, also including him in other three "Top 7:" at the fourth place in their list of "The Top 7... Mentally damaged characters we love;" as the sixth most badass game character of the generation (as of 2012), and his romance with Nicole Brennan was ranked as the fifth most disastrous in video games.
