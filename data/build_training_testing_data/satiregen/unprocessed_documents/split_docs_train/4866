 This morning on "Starting Point," Soledad O'Brien talks with Mark Regev, spokesperson for the Israeli government and for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She asks him about the latest developments this morning, namely that Israel ground offensive plans against Gaza were put on hold to allow for cease-fire negotiations. "We would like to see a diplomatic solution, if that's possible," Regev says. "If it's possible to get the end of these incoming rockets on our people, if it's possible to do that peacefully, we're all in favor.  On Monday, the team of grave diggers at Shaikh Radwan Cemetery in Gaza City prepared 15 graves, their busiest morning yet. And they're preparing for more. One of the slots was for 5-year-old Yusif Al-Dalou. He and eight members of his family were killed Sunday in an Israeli airstrike on their home.  This morning on "Starting Point," Woodrow Wilson Center's Robin Wright weighs in on the ongoing Israel-Gaza crisis and challenges in negotiating a cease-fire. "The sequence of events will likely play out for two or three days," Wright says. "And then you have to deal with the core problem, and that's the chicken and egg argument. The Israelis are saying we want a ceasefire and then we'll talk about the political issues.
