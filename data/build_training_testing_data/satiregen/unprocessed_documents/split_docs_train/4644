 Nine students and a teacher were killed Friday morning in a shooting at Santa Fe High School in the southeastern Texas city of Santa Fe. It's the 22nd school shooting in the US in 2018. This is what we know:  CASUALTIES 10 people are dead, a law enforcement official said. Nine of those killed are students and one a teacher.  Kelly Clarkson declined to hold a moment of silence for the victims of the Santa Fe High School shooting Sunday while hosting the Billboard Music Awards Sunday, instead calling for a moment of action. "I'm a Texas girl and my home state has had so much heartbreak over this past year, and once again, y'all, we're grieving for kids who have died for just no reason at all," she said. Clarkson said the show wanted her to hold a moment of silence, but she didn't want one. "They wanted me to say that, obviously, we want to pray for all the victims, we want to pray for all their families," she said.  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called for action on Friday in the wake of a deadly school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas. "We need to do more than just pray for the victims and their families," said Abbott, a Republican, during a news conference in response to the shooting. "It's time in Texas that we take action to step up and make sure this tragedy is never repeated ever again in the history of the state of Texas."
