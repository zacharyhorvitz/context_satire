Morning is the period of time from sunrise to noon. There are no exact times for when morning begins (also true for evening and night) because it can vary according to one's lifestyle and the hours of daylight at each time of year. However, morning strictly ends at noon, which is when afternoon starts. Morning can be defined as starting from midnight to noon, or from sunrise (which varies throughout the year) to noon, or from when one wakes up to noon.Morning precedes afternoon, evening, and night in the sequence of a day. Early Christianity is a period in the history of Christianity, generally reckoned by church historians to begin with the ministry of Jesus (c. 27-30) and end with the First Council of Nicaea (325). It is typically divided into two periods: Christianity in the 1st century which is known as the Apostolic Age (c. 30–100) and the Ante-Nicene Period (c. 100–325). Christians in the Roman Empire were persecuted until Emperor Constantine I's toleration and promotion of Christianity. The earliest followers of Jesus were an apocalyptic, Second Temple Jewish sect of Jewish Christians in the Roman province of Judea.
