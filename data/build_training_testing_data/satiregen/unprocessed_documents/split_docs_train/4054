When the Federal Open Market Committee wishes to reduce interest rates they will increase the supply of money by buying government securities. When additional supply is added and everything else remains constant, the price of borrowed funds – the federal funds rate – falls. Conversely, when the Committee wishes to increase the federal funds rate, they will instruct the Desk Manager to sell government securities, thereby taking the money they earn on the proceeds of those sales out of circulation and reducing the money supply. When supply is taken away and everything else remains constant, the interest rate will normally rise. In her review for LA Weekly, Amy Nicholson praised the film by saying that "Fed Up is poised to be the Inconvenient Truth of the health movement.

Geoffrey Berkshire in his review for Variety said that "Stephanie Soechtig's documentary effectively gets the message out about America's addiction to unhealthy food." Robert Cameron Fowler from Indiewire in his review said that "'Fed Up' is a glossy package that gets its warnings across loud and clear: we need to change what we eat."
