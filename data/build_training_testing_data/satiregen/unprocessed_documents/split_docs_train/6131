At one time, District 109 contained as many as eight elementary schools. However, Maplewood, Woodland Park, Briarwood, and Cadwell, (the original Deerfield Grammar School located on Deerfield Road was torn down to build the District Offices) were all closed beginning in the 1970s through the 1980s and their students absorbed by the four larger, remaining elementary schools. A very small part of the far western side of the village is Lincolnshire District 103 and Stevenson High School's area. However there are no residents officially living there. When Kaufman was a young child, she wrote her one and only fan letter to Greg Brady (Barry Williams), which went unanswered. So, at Snapple, when she realized how many people were trying to connect with the company, she took it upon herself to answer all the letters, since she remembered how terrible she felt when Williams never replied. Kaufman is not an actress and she never vigorously pursued acting. However, she played a blackjack dealer in Vegas Vacation in 1997 and a bridal clerk in the 1998 film Enough Already. She was also featured in the film Funny Valentine with Anthony Michael Hall, as well as the short-lived series The Beat. In 2013, she  portrayed Minnie, a loan company employee, in the film College Debts.
