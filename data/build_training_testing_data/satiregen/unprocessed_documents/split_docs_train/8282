In November 2016, Rutgers released research findings that revealed "an untold history of some of the institution's founders as slave owners and the displacement of the Native Americans who once occupied land that was later transferred to the college." Despite being the "Birthplace of College Football" and sharing the 1869 national championship with Princeton University in the first year of intercollegiate play, Rutgers has not had an overly successful heritage in the sport through the years. Especially in the last three decades, Rutgers was regarded as one of the worst teams in what is now known as FBS (known as Division I-A before 2006), posting several losing seasons in a row and raising discussion of possibly reducing the team to I-AA/FCS competition. For most of its existence, the football team was not associated with any formal football conference and remained independent even when the first football leagues were forming. At present, Rutgers participates in Division I FBS and joined the Big Ten Conference in 2014, after more than two decades in the original Big East Conference and one season in its football-sponsoring offshoot, the American Athletic Conference.  A hot startup company is way more fascinating to Americans than the financial turmoil engulfing a country that's been around for thousands of years. At least that's the takeaway from U.S. search traffic on Google. Greece may be teetering on the edge of default, but that's not bothered too many Americans. U.S. users who turn to Google are twice as likely to search for "Uber" and 10 times as likely to search for "jobs," according to an analysis of U.S. Google Trends data by ConvergEx.
