Suotamo is mostly known for his role as Chewbacca in the Star Wars franchise, a role in which he started out being a body double for the original Chewbacca actor Peter Mayhew in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, as Mayhew's age and worsening health was making it more difficult for him to fill the role (Mayhew would later pass away on April 30, 2019). He went on to entirely replace Mayhew in Star Wars: The Last Jedi as Chewbacca, with Mayhew as a consultant. He then reprised his role as Chewbacca in Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.  Peter Mayhew, the original Chewbacca, has died, according to his agent. Mayhew, 74, died on April 30 with his family by his side in his North Texas home. He is survived by his wife, Angie, and three children. The Hollywood icon played Chewbacca in the original "Star Wars" trilogy, episode 3 of the prequels and the New Trilogy, according to a statement from his family. In his first six screen appearances, Chewbacca was played by Peter Mayhew, who was chosen for his height of 7'3" (2.2 m). Five similar costumes were created for Mayhew: in the three original films and a holiday special, the suits were made of yak hair and mohair. In Revenge of the Sith, the suit was made of more comfortable materials, though Mayhew's filming only lasted a day. Only Mayhew's blue eyes could be seen in his costume, but fans easily recognize him by his gestures, and his co-workers claimed the ability to tell when a stand-in was taking his place.
