 English-language broadcast networks won't carry President Obama's primetime address outlining his plans for executive action on deportations Thursday night,  but the speech is set to make a big splash among his target audience — Hispanic Americans — as it cuts into one of the Hispanic community's biggest television events of the year, the Latin Grammys. The four major networks —ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC — currently have no plans to broadcast it, most instead airing their fall finales — a choice one Hispanic advocate called a "double standard" aimed at President Obama.

Last year's show averaged around 4.6 million viewers, according to Univision, and was the number-two network that night- English or Spanish - among the coveted 18--34 demographic.  It's coming next week. Or next month. It'll protect 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation. Or 3 million. From the beginning of his presidency, Obama supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for many immigrants illegally residing in the United States. However, Congress did not pass a comprehensive immigration bill during Obama's tenure, and Obama turned to executive actions. In the 2010 lame-duck session, Obama supported passage of the DREAM Act, which passed the House but failed to overcome a Senate filibuster in a 55-41 vote in favor of the bill. In 2013, the Senate passed an immigration bill with a path to citizenship, but the House did not vote on the bill.
