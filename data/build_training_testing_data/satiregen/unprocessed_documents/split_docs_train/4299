Glick's views on the politicization of science in Spain came together in an article on the generalized absence of “civil discourse” and the tendency to enlist all ideas in the ongoing ideological warfare between left and right. Glick's notion of civil discourse has been picked up far afield—in Spanish business history and in the history of science in 20th century China, for example. His interest in civil discourse led him to Emilio Herrera, a politically conservative general who remained loyal to the Second Republic, and was, at the same time, the pioneer of modern aeronautics in Spain. Glick edited his memoirs and contributed a study of Herrera's role in aeronautical engineering. Glick's work falls within two broad areas. As a medievalist, he is best seen as a historian of technology but has also written interesting syntheses of medieval science, from a comparative perspective. As a historian of modern science he has concentrated on the reception of strong paradigms—Darwinism, psychoanalysis, and relativity—in the Iberian world. In both areas, he is a comparativist and has commented from time to time on methodological and historiographical approaches. Glick is a lifelong resident of New York City and has lived in Greenwich Village for over 40 years. A graduate of the City University of New York's Queens College, she received a Masters of Business Administration degree from Fordham University. Glick owned and managed a small printing business in TriBeCa before becoming Deputy Director of General Services at the New York City Department of Housing, Preservation, and Development, where she worked until May 1990.
