Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said that the company is "changing our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers' devices in these circumstances." On July 23, 2009, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos posted on Amazon's official Kindle forum an apology about the company's handling of the matter. Bezos said the action was "stupid", and that the executives at Amazon "deserve the criticism received". The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon is a 2013 book written by journalist Brad Stone. It documents the rise of Amazon.com. While a bestseller it received its first one-star review on Amazon from MacKenzie Bezos, then wife of Jeff Bezos, claiming many inaccuracies in her extensive review, while pointing out only one, the timing of Jeff Bezos reading the novel Remains of the Day. Stone was allowed access to many current and former Amazon executives, but not to anyone directly associated with Bezos himself.  The Brazilian government walked back its rejection of $20 million in foreign aid to help fight fires blazing in the Amazon rainforest on Tuesday, saying it would take international aid after all. Acceptance of the funds, however, would hinge on the Brazilian government being able to administrate the aid, clarified presidential spokesperson Otavio Rego Barros. Earlier this week, Brazil escalated its war of words with global powers over the Amazon fires, which now number 80,626 this year -- a 79% rise on last year. On Tuesday morning, the special communications office for President Jair Bolsonaro told CNN that Brazil would turn down the money that was pledged for the Amazon at the G7 summit in France the day before.
