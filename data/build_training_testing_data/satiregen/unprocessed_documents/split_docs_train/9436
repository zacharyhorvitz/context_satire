 Russia could be making moves to establish an air base in northeastern Syria on the border with Turkey, a development that could further complicate the overall situation in the region, two U.S. officials have told CNN. The United States has seen a "limited" number of Russian military personnel, more akin to an exploratory party, looking at an airfield in Qamishli, Syria, possibly to determine how they might use the site, the officials said Thursday. "We don't know what their intent is, but it is something we are watching closely," one official said, citing the already fraught relationship between Turkey and Russia after Turkey's shootdown last year of a Russian military jet that Ankara said had breached Turkish airspace. The move was first reported by Fox News. The Pentagon Papers, officially titled Report of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force, is a United States Department of Defense history of the United States' political and military involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967. The papers were released by Daniel Ellsberg, who had worked on the study; they were first brought to the attention of the public on the front page of The New York Times in 1971. A 1996 article in The New York Times said that the Pentagon Papers had demonstrated, among other things, that the Johnson Administration "systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress."  The Pentagon has now been granted new legal authority allowing the military go on the offensive against ISIS in Afghanistan. When the State Department announced the designation of ISIS in Afghanistan and Pakistan as a Foreign Terrorist Organization last week, it led to a change in the rules of engagement for U.S. forces, according to defense officials. The development was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The designation applies to what the U.S. now calls ISIS-K (ISIS-Khorasan), which is the ISIS branch in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
