The Quincunx Cycle is a series of novels written by Trinidadian-Canadian author André Alexis. Each novel is based on one of the themes of faith, place, love, power and hatred and all take place in and around Southern Ontario with Fifteen Dogs and The Hidden Keys both set in Toronto. Alexis began the series in 2014 with Pastoral. The second novel in the series, Fifteen Dogs, was the recipient of the 2015 Giller Prize. While labelled the third in the series, Quincunx 3 will be the last in order of publication. While promoting Days by Moonlight Alexis revealed that the final novel would be called Ring and also suggested that, while characters from each series have cameos in other books, Ring would more clearly link the works together. An Ottawa born priest, Father Christopher Pennant, is given a parish in Barrow in Lambton County. He accidentally becomes embroiled in the love affairs of two of his younger parishioners. Elizabeth Denny, an orphan, seeks guidance from Pennant when she discover her fiancé Robbie Myers is having an affair with his teenage sweetheart Jane Richardson. Upon being discovered he affirms that he loves them both equally, something that everyone he speaks to doubts.
