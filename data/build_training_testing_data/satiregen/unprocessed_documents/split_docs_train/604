At the next Democratic debate at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, on November 15, Clinton rebounded to previous form, aggressively combating Obama's and Edwards' attacks. Democratic strategist Garry South said, "To the degree she might have been stumbling in the last debate, she regained her footing tonight," while ABC News said, "After her roughest two weeks on the presidential campaign trail,  showed up on a debate stage in Las Vegas ... with a new aggressive game plan and appeared to successfully get her campaign ship back on course." Her answer to the previously troublesome question of supporting driver's licenses for illegal immigrants was now given in one word: "No."  Donald Trump on Tuesday denied trying to intimidate Hillary Clinton during their debate Sunday night by encroaching into her space on stage. Trump, in a humorous riff at a rally in Panama City, Florida, slammed the media for writing that he tried to get too close to the Democratic nominee. "Did you see what she said, that I entered her space? This is a liar.  It's happening: the final presidential debate. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are scheduled to cap off the last of three official presidential debates on Wednesday at 9:00 p.m. ET. CNN will air the event in its entirety on its networks as well as through a live stream on CNN.com.
