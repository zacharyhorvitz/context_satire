It is, as the title suggests, a collection of songs which would have been popular, or topical, at the date of publication. There is a considerable amount of additional material relating to biographies and very interesting articles on the lives of the authors, together with historical comments of the day which had influenced them in their choices of songs. In 1862 Thomas Allan published the first book in this series, which was called "Tyneside songs". The first edition was very small and covered mainly songs of Edward “Ned” Corvan and George "Geordie" Ridley. Over the years he developed the book, adding to it, until eventually it became an extremely large volume with almost 600 pages and contained 400 songs. The name was changed to Allan's Tyneside Songs, and the contents increased to cover not just the songs but details and histories of them, their writers and singers. As it developed the theme changed from one of solely popular songs to encompass many older traditional songs, aiming to spread the popularity of the book to a wider audience. It is now an invaluable source of historical reference providing wealth of information.
