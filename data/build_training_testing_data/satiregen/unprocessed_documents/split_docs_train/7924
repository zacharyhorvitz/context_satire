 House Speaker Paul Ryan appeared on several morning shows Wednesday -- just hours after the Senate voted to pass the tax bill -- to defend the legislation he's worked toward since 1993. "When (the bill) gets in place, when people see their paychecks getting bigger in February because withholding tables have adjusted to reflect their tax cuts, when businesses are keeping more of what they earn, when they can write off their spending and hire more people, that's going to change its popularity, I am convinced," he told CBS in an interview. "So I think there's just tons of confusion out there as to what this does or doesn't do. A lot of people think it's going to raise their taxes.  Somewhere, not that long ago, we've heard all these arguments before. Republicans finally have their longed-for tax reform, but now they have to sell it. And the rhetoric they are using to do so is raising comparisons to desperate Democratic efforts to mitigate the unpopularity of Obamacare seven years ago. In short: It will get more popular once people learn more about it and the other party stops criticizing it.  House Speaker Paul Ryan batted down rumors Tuesday that he is looking to end his time in his current position any time soon. "I'm not leaving this job," Ryan told his fellow Republicans at a conference meeting, a source in the room told CNN. The conference responded with a standing ovation. Asked about the reports he was planning to step down at his weekly news conference, Ryan said "I am not going anywhere anytime soon."
