 You know the scandals in the Catholic Church are bad when a leading American cardinal says his own mother is ashamed to show her faith in public. That's what Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday. "You don't think that did me in?" said Dolan, often one of the more cheery American churchmen.  Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the embattled archbishop of Washington, will travel to the Vatican "in the very near future" to ask Pope Francis to accept his resignation, a spokesman said. In a letter to priests in the diocese, Wuerl said he will meet with Francis about the resignation he presented nearly three years ago at age 75, the mandatory age for Catholic bishops to submit their retirement to the Pope. He said a decision about his future "is an essential aspect so that this archdiocesan church we all love can move forward." "Our discernment here, I believe, has indicated the way forward to bring healing and a new beginning at the service of this church," Wuerl said. The washing of the feet just mentioned angered many Catholic traditionalists. Pope Francis performed the Lenten washing of the feet, traditionally at Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, at a juvenile detention home and included two girls and two Muslims. He had stated that he wanted to bring the church closer to the poor and marginalized. so as to be in service of one another.
