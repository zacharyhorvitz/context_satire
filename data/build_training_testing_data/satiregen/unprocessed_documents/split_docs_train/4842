 When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot in Windsor's St. George's Chapel, there's one person whose absence will be keenly felt: Diana, Princess of Wales. But small details in the planning of the wedding make it clear that Harry wants his beloved mother's presence to be felt despite her early death in a road accident in Paris in 1997. In a BBC interview last November marking his engagement to Markle, he spoke of his conviction that his fiancée and his mother would have been firm friends. "They'd be thick as thieves, without question," Harry said. On 31 August 1997, Diana died in a car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris while the driver was fleeing the paparazzi. The crash also resulted in the deaths of her companion Dodi Fayed and the driver, Henri Paul, who was the acting security manager of the Hôtel Ritz Paris. Diana's bodyguard, Trevor Rees-Jones, survived the crash. The televised funeral, on 6 September, was watched by a British television audience that peaked at 32.10 million, which was one of the United Kingdom's highest viewing figures ever.  The presence of Prince Harry's mother, Princess Diana, was subtly felt at her son's wedding to the American actress Meghan Markle, more than two decades after she was killed in a car crash in Paris. Observers saw a clear nod to the mother-in-law whom Meghan will never meet in the choice of her wedding dress train. More transparent than the one worn by Diana when she married Prince Charles in 1981, but just as long. The bridal bouquet, hand-picked Friday evening by Prince Harry, contained white forget-me-nots, his mother's favorite flowers, according to Kensington Palace.
