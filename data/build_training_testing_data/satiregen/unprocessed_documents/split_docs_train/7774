In contemporary politics, presidential job approval is highly partisan. Obama in his last year as sitting president achieved a job approval rating of 80 to 90 percent among Democrats and 15 to 20 percent among Republicans, while President Donald Trump in 2018 has a job approval of 75 to 90 among Republicans and 5 to 10 among Democrats. Gallup polling has found that, as of 2019, 47% of Americans are either "Democrats or Democratic leaners" while 42% are either "Republicans or Republican leaners". By the beginning of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped to a low of just 19Â percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans. Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being "the worst president," Bush would say, "I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls." Gallup's most admired man and woman poll is an annual poll that Gallup has conducted at the end of most years since 1948. Americans are asked, without prompting, to say what man and woman "living today in any part of the world, do  admire most?" The result is published as a top ten list. Most years the most admired man is the sitting President of the United States and the most admired woman is or has been the First Lady of the United States.
