   The government of Kazakhstan in a statement Saturday distanced itself from Boston bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokar Tsarnaev, who allegedly lived in the country before coming to the United States. The Kazakh foreign ministry denied the two had been residents and condemned the Boston attacks. The family of Katherine Russell, wife of suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, issued a typed statement outside their North Kingstown, New Hampshire, house Friday, according to The North Kingstown Patch. It read: "Our daughter has lost her husband today, the father of her child. The speed with which a U.S. community could be transformed into what was essentially a police state. To recap, a few nights after the Boston marathon bombing in 2013, two men, Dzhokar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, were implicated in the bombing ... During the ensuing night chase, Tamerlan was shot and killed by police while Dzhokar evaded arrest. Within hours, there was a citywide manhunt and Boston authorities advised citizens to shelter in place ... The city basically shut down while armed police and military vehicles scoured the streets for the bad guy.  The FBI has flatly rejected an assertion by the mother of the two suspected Boston bombers that the bureau had been tracking her oldest son and had spoken with him last week after the deadly marathon bombing. The chief spokesman for the FBI, Mike Kortan, said he continues to stand by an FBI  statement issued Friday that said that the only communication the FBI ever had with Tamerlan Tsarnaev was an interview agents conducted with him in 2011 at the urging of a foreign government, since identified as Russia. Did one brother brainwash the other? Zubeidat Tsarnaev, the mother of the suspected bombers, told reporters the FBI had tracked her oldest son for as long as five years.
