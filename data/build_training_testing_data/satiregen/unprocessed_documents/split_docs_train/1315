Zabediel/Zabed:A scribe in the service of King Eliam. Zabed has lived for millennia. It was he who wrote on the scroll taken from Sil Arnoth the location of the Wyrm Lord, and the prophecies of Paragor's rise and that of the Three Witnesses. Zabediel is known to have lived, until the third book's beginning, in the secluded village of Balesparr. In the third book of the series, The Final Storm, the two worlds reunite into one, so that all separation and distinction between each Glimpse and the human to which it corresponds ceases to exist. Aidan Thomas:The main character: At first concerned only with his own convenience (or lack thereof), Aidan becomes brave, loyal, and self-sacrificing after he enters Alleble. Invited by King Eliam, he enters the Realm and becomes a knight, in which role he brings Mithegard, one of Alleble's neighbors, to become Alleble's ally in its war with Paragor. A favorite ruse of his, used in the first and third books, is to disguise himself in the livery of Paragor in order to infiltrate the latter's territory. Aidan is revealed in The Final Storm to be one of the 'Three Witnesses'; one of three prophesied heroes who bring about the final end of the said war.
