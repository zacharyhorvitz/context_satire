Danny Phantom centers on the life and adventures of Danny Fenton (voiced by David Kaufman), a fourteen-year-old boy living in the small town of Amity Park. He lives with his ghost-hunting parents, Jack and Maddie (Rob Paulsen and Kath Soucie), and his overprotective but caring sixteen-year-old sister, Jazz (Colleen Villard). Upon pressure from his two best friends, Sam Manson (Grey DeLisle) and Tucker Foley (Rickey D'Shon Collins), Danny decides to explore the Ghost Portal created by his parents in their attempt to bridge the real world and the Ghost Zone (the parallel universe in which ghosts reside), that when plugged in, failed to work. Once inside, he inadvertently presses the "On" button (which his parents naively failed to do), thus activating the Portal and infusing his DNA with ectoplasm, transforming him into a half-ghost. From the opening notes of the Danny Phantom theme song, you knew that was Danny Phantom. The end credit music is amazing; the music inside the show where Danny's fighting a ghost, or when a relationship gets really tender, and there's a tender moment, the music there is amazing, too. Plus, to top it all off, the amazing song by Ember, "Remember," was a great song. People just love that song and really responded to it really well. The title of "Best in Show" is given to the dog chosen as the winner of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show according to conformation show rules. It has its origins in the variety classes for champions that were introduced in 1905 which included prizes for best champion dog and best champion bitch. The title of Best in Show at Westminster has been awarded every year beginning in 1907 except for 1923 when changes in American Kennel Club rules prohibited mixed breed judging until a uniform process could be adopted; following further changes in rules it was awarded again in 1924. The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is an all-breeds conformation show.
