On 29 January 2010, during the News of the World phone hacking affair, Brown said that his landline may have been bugged in an "amateurish attempt" in 1998, around the time of his outing. He was also contacted by police in the West of England in 2003 who told him that they were pursuing a phone-tapping prosecution and he was one of those who may have been targeted. The case collapsed when it reached court and full details of the allegations were never disclosed. Brown said that: "Given that it was near  Highgrove, my assumption was that this might involve the Royal Family. On the evening of February 1, 2008, a week before his 16th birthday, Browning went into his house after other family members were in bed and shot each of them using a gun belonging to his father. According to police reports, he confessed to the killings of his family on the following Sunday and was charged with four counts of first-degree murder. He was denied bail at a hearing later that day. The earliest societies at Brown were devoted to oration and debate. The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of Solomon Drowne, class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771. It seems to have disappeared during the American Revolutionary War. We next hear of the Misokosmian Society, founded in 1794 and renamed the Philermenian Society in 1798.
