 He's prepped. His campaign's armed with spin. All that's left for Mitt Romney to do is to step into the proverbial ring and verbally duke it out with someone his own campaign called a "universally acclaimed public speaker." Romney enters Wednesday's debate in Denver down in swing state polls and trying to recover from his politically damaging comments about nearly half the nation being shoo-ins for President Barack Obama.  While both campaigns have been lowering expectations ahead of Wednesday's first presidential debate, two of Mitt Romney's more notable surrogates raised the bar on Sunday, with one predicting Romney will turn the race "upside down." Both New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. John McCain said they expect Romney to shine when he shares the Denver stage for the first time with President Barack Obama. "We have a candidate who is going to do extraordinarily well on Wednesday night," Chris Christie said on "Face the Nation" on CBS.  The Obama and Romney campaigns are seeking to manage -- and in some cases lower -- expectations for their candidate's performance in the first presidential debate. CNN obtained a memo on Thursday circulated by Beth Myers, an adviser to Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, that outlines several reasons why President Barack Obama may win the first of three scheduled encounters next Wednesday in Denver. Obama, Myers wrote, "is a universally acclaimed public speaker and has substantial debate experience under his belt," referencing the Democrat's 2008 campaign against John McCain. Myers also warned that Obama would likely go after Romney.
