A media report surfaced on July 11, 2018, claiming that Schnatter had used a racial epithet in a conference call the previous May, along with graphic descriptions of violence against racial minorities. Forbes magazine reported that a media agency working with Papa John's severed its relationship with the company following the report. Steve Ritchie, who had replaced Schnatter as CEO, responded with a memo stating that "racism has no place at Papa John's," and a company spokesman wrote in an email that Papa John's "condemns racism". The same day, Schnatter admitted to using the racial epithet during the conference call and resigned as chairman of the company's board of directors.  John Schnatter is Papa John. He's tied to Papa John's advertising as cheese is to pizza, but he resigned as chairman for using a racial slur. How can Papa John's move forward when the guy causing the company's problems is in the commercials and on all the signs, pizza boxes and even the logo? Schnatter remains on the board and he's still the company's largest shareholder, but Papa John's must now pivot to a marketing campaign not attached to his identity.  The face of Papa John's is being sliced out of its ads. The pizza chain is removing John Schnatter's face from its marketing materials, two days after he admitted to using the N-word during a company conference call. The Associated Press first reported the news and a Papa John's spokesperson confirmed it to CNNMoney. Top executives decided to remove Schnatter but details are still being worked out.
