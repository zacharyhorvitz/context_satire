 Donald Trump is escalating his attacks on Sen. Marco Rubio with a special delivery for his rival: "Trump Ice Natural Spring Water." Trump has previously trained his fire on Rubio, claiming he has the worst voting attendance record in the U.S. Senate and that he sweats a lot. But CNN learned that the Trump campaign sent a "care package" to Rubio's Washington campaign office that contained a 24-bottle case of "Trump Ice Natural Spring Water," with Trump's face on it, two "Make America Great Again" towels and bumper stickers and a note reading, "Since you're always sweating, we thought you could use some water. Enjoy!"  Comedian Jay Leno, who got to temporarily retake the reins of the "Tonight Show" on Tuesday, used his brief return to the spotlight to skewer 2016 presidential hopefuls. After likening Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley's 2% in the polls to "tying with two percent milk," Leno pivoted to the crowded Republican field. Leno noted that after the CNN Republican debate last month, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was dubbed "The best communicator in the Republican Party" by some, "which is kind of like being the smartest Kardashian." Leno got to sub in for a few minutes when host Jimmy Fallon got a fake injury in the middle of his opening monologue.  Carly Fiorina has officially made the short-list of 2016 favorites of the Koch Brothers' powerful political network, solidifying her standing in the Republican fundraising race. The Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce -- which funds the sprawling constellation of conservative groups -- confirmed Wednesday it is now blessing Fiorina as one of its five candidates. It previously also backed Scott Walker before he dropped out last month. "Governor Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina and Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio are leading a thoughtful and substantive discussion on the issues and we look forward to hearing more about their vision for the country," said James Davis, a Freedom Partners spokesman.
