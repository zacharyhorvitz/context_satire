 Rep. Gwen Moore's office is rallying members of Congress to join her in raising a pencil on Tuesday during President Barack Obama's State of the Union address to honor the victims of the terrorist attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. At least 50 Democratic House members have already told Moore's office they will join her during some of the speech's applause lines when Obama speaks about freedom of expression and the terror attacks in Paris. State of the Union: Obama's Robin Hood turn "We in no way want to disrupt the State of the Union. We appreciate the fact that all members of Congress will be here at one time to show support and solidarity," said Eric Harris, Moore's press secretary who hatched the idea.  The bear is loose -- this time on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. President Barack Obama focused on the economic gains that he hopes will become his presidential legacy during his State of the Union address on Tuesday, and he decided to have a little fun, too -- just another sign of a fourth-quarter presidency. "I have no more campaigns to run," Obama said, drawing loud applause from Republicans in the chamber. But Obama had a quick comeback: "I know, 'cause I won both of 'em," he said going off script and drawing applause from Democrats.  After disappointing Wall Street critics by signing into law bills that weakened his landmark financial regulatory overhaul law, President Barack Obama delivered an emphatic message Tuesday night: Dodd-Frank is here to stay. Financial reform groups breathed a sigh of relief as the president warned Congress against "unraveling the new rules on Wall Street" in his annual State of the Union address. As Obama touted the nation's economic recovery and rallied Congress to do more for the middle class, he also spoke sternly about possible attempts to chip away at his signature 2010 law. Any legislation that tries to weaken oversight of big banks, Obama added, "will earn my veto."
