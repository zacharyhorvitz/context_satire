 Republican presidential candidates clashed with each other and the moderators in some memorable ways during Wednesday's debate hosted by CNBC in Boulder, Colorado. From smiles to kisses, here are some of the night's biggest moments, in GIFs. When Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said he would pose a choice to the Chinese when it comes to dealing with him. When Graham admitted the reason he had an iPhone in the first place after being asked what his favorite apps were.  Marco Rubio shined on the debate stage Wednesday night â€” and the timing couldn't have been better. The Florida senator brought his A-game to the third Republican presidential debate of the campaign season, sharply attacking his rivals and the media, swatting away criticisms about his candidacy, and bringing a personal narrative to the prime-time event sponsored by CNBC. Rubio's strong performance could prove to be devastating for his one-time mentor, Jeb Bush. The former Florida governor and heir to a political dynasty came to Boulder badly in need of of a jolt to energize his stalled campaign.  Just hours before the third Republican debate, Jeb Bush's campaign released a hard-hitting video against one of his rivals, but it's not someone who will be on the stage Wednesday night. The highly-produced video goes after Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, portraying her as a "third-term Obama," with ominous music playing in the background. Video of trash on the ground, homelessness and smoke in the air are just some of the images that are seen while juxtaposed with footage from Clinton in the Democratic debate. The 1:45 minute video, "Failed Agenda," shows a clip of Clinton giving Obama the letter grade of "A" and praising the executive action he's taken on immigration, vowing, as she did in the debate, to go even "further" on the issue.
