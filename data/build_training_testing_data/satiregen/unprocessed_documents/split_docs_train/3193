The interviews of the two family friends revealed new allegations - they said that the children were forced to raise their hands before speaking, could not wish each other happy birthday, and could not laugh at the dinner table. Other reports were related to how the children were poorly fed and looked small for their ages, and how they acted "scared to death of Jen" and like "trained robots". The Hart family moved to Woodland in 2017, next to the DeKalb family. In August of that year, Hannah Hart jumped out of her bedroom window at around 1:30 to try and contact the DeKalbs, saying, “Don’t make me go back! They’re racists and they abuse us!”. Soon afterwards, Jen and Sarah found Hannah, and brought her back home. The women began their relationship at the university; on Facebook Jennifer stated that the women were initially in the closet and faced ostracism once they publicly outed themselves, prompting their moves. They moved to Alexandra, Minnesota in 2004, were subsequently residents of West Linn, Oregon, and Woodland, Washington; and had six adopted children during their lives. The couple was living in Woodland at the time of the crash. In 2005 Sarah asked the local court to have her family name altered to match her partner's.
