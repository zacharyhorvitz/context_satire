 Journalists responded to Steve Bannon's "shut up" comment with a word: "No." And with many other words. The anti-media sentiments from President Trump's chief strategist, which he discussed in an interview with the New York Times in which he also called the press "the opposition party," spurred hours of conversations and a swarm of tweets on Thursday. Groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists and the American Civil Liberties Union also weighed in.  During his inaugural address, President Donald Trump reiterated one of his key campaign themes, pledging to eradicate Islamic terrorism "from the face of the Earth." But President Trump's objective of destroying ISIS and other jihadi groups that sow terror in the region and beyond -- however desirable -- is also fantastically otherworldly. Back here on Earth, the reality is that the laws of gravity in the fight against terror will make eradicating ISIS and its ilk an elusive goal. Meanwhile, some of the steps the new administration has already taken, specifically on immigration restrictions, may make an already impossible job harder still.  President Donald Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority nations will be used by ISIS as a recruitment tool, giving the militant group a major propaganda boost, former jihadists have told CNN. The executive order, which blocks all immigrants and visa holders who are citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, reinforces ISIS' narrative, according to former jihadi Abu Abdullah. "It can play into their propaganda, to make it clear for anyone who could be in doubt, that it's a war on Islam and all Muslims," Abdullah told CNN over a messaging service. The names of the now-defected foreign fighters in this story have been changed to protect their identities.
