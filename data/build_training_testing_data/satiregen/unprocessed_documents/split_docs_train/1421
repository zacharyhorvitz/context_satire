The Paul Sauer Bridge, also known as the Storms River Bridge, is a deck arch bridge over the Storms River in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. The bridge is located on the Garden Route section of National Route 2, between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. At a maximum height of 120 metres (394 ft) above the Storms River, it was the highest concrete arch in Africa until the Bloukrans Bridge, 216 metres (709 ft), opened on the same road in 1984. It is named after Paul Sauer.
