At the age of 20, Aaron Smith played drums on The Temptations' megahit "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" (which was a #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and won three Grammy Awards in 1973), and recorded with Ray Charles as well. In the fall of 1974, Smith toured with Czechoslovakian bassist Miroslav Vitouš in support of Miroslav's Warner Bros. release Magical Shepherd. After this tour, he moved to Boston, where he studied for two years under jazz drummer Alan Dawson. From Boston, he moved to San Francisco where he was a co-founder of the power funk trio Peter Bilt. The Hollywood Reporter  named Cats one of the ten worst films of 2019, Travers said it "easily scores as the bottom of the 2019 barrel—and arguably of the decade," and Adam Graham of The Detroit News said "Cats is the biggest disaster of the decade, and possibly thus far in the millennium. It's Battlefield Earth with whiskers." Alex Cranz of io9 warned "I have seen sights no human should see" but said others "must witness" Hooper's, the actors', and Hollywood's hubris, citing a human being appearing in a group of cats, a cat-coloured woman without fur, and other examples of how "the shit's just not finished." Ty Burr of The Boston Globe's one half-star review said "there are moments in 'Cats' I would gladly pay to unsee" and warned small children to not watch the film. Smith played his 50th international test match in the final test against Wales, during the 2016 tour, alongside lock Brodie Retallick, with whom he debuted. Although Smith lost his place as the All Blacks' Haka leader later in the season due to off-field controversy, as well as strong competition for a starting place, from TJ Perenara, Smith was retained as a regular starter into the 2017 season, when he started in all three tests against the touring British and Irish Lions.
