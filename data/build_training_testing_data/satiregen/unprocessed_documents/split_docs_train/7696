"I think I appreciate it even more than my (college) teammates," Lanier reflected on the Final Four in 1985, "because I had a basis for comparison. It wasn't the money, or who got the 'numbers' like in the NBA. We weren't any big stars, it was a couple of guys from Buffalo and a guy from Troy all blending together." In the Season 8 episode "The Tiger in the Tale", Sweets and Daisy rent an apartment together, and both, especially Daisy, seem excited at the chance to live together. Later, though, Sweets starts to have doubts about moving in with her, especially after learning from Angela and Booth that, while he may not see moving in with Daisy to be a big deal, she likely does. After Daisy states that she believes living together will eventually lead to marriage, especially if she gets pregnant, Sweets realizes that he and Daisy want different things out of their relationship (since he is not sure that he wants them to get married), and breaks up with her. Sweets gives her the key to the apartment, allowing her to live there herself, while, after spending two weeks living in his office, he moves in with Brennan and Booth because Booth feels badly for him. Booth meets Hannah in Afghanistan after saving her from a situation with armed men. Since Booth had been rejected by Brennan in Season 5, the two form a bond and start a relationship. Booth tells Brennan that their relationship is as "serious as a heart attack" and that he is in love with her. Hannah transfers to D.C. and moves in with Booth, even meeting his son and becoming friends with Bones.
