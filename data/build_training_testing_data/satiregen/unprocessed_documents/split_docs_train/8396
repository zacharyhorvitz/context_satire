 Canada's Senate has passed a bill making the country's national anthem gender-neutral.

"We were scratching our toes for almost the duration of the trip," Eddie Zytner said. Zytner, 25, and his girlfriend, Katie Stephens, 22, of Windsor, Ontario, returned home January 18 with itchy feet. Four days later, that itch turned into painful swelling and blisters, he said.
