 Former American Idol contestant Antonella Maria Barba has been sentenced to 45 months in prison for possession of fentanyl with the intent to distribute 400 grams or more of the substance, the U.S. Attorney's Office Eastern District of Virginia announced. She had pleaded guilty to the charges in July. Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid which the CDC says has seen a sharp rise in the number of police seizures of the drug in recent years. Barba, 32, was sitting in a rental car in Norfolk, New Jersey when law enforcement approached her vehicle.  In terms of celebrity beefs, Jenna Dewan is insisting this one is a nothing burger. Some Camila Cabello fans thought Dewan was being critical of the singer during her performance at the American Music Awards Sunday night. It all started with a since deleted tweet which accused Dewan of mouthing to her date for the evening, friend and stylist Brad Goreski , that Cabello was being "extra" during her performance of "Se√±orita" with Cabello's reported boyfriend Shawn Mendes. Dewan, who is expecting her second child and first baby with boyfriend Steve Kazee, had posted video of Cabello's solo performance (she took to the stage a few times Sunday night) on her Instagram stories, writing "Yassss" with some fire emojis.  Where to even begin? Sunday night was the American Music Awards and there was a lot going on.
