The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's Counterterrorism Center (CTC) was established in 1986, and is a division of the CIA's National Clandestine Service. It is not to be confused with the National Counterterrorism Center, which is a separate entity. From 2006, the Director of the Counterterrorism Center was Michael D’Andrea, who was publicly referred to only as "Roger". The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, California—the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula—to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and the United States. It was initially designed by engineer Joseph Strauss in 1917. The operations of the FBI have significantly expanded and streamlined in the 21st century. The Intelligence Branch, as a distinct entity, came about in the wake of the September 11 terror attacks in 2001. Intelligence analysis became a critical focus for national security efforts, and the FBI Counterterrorism Division (CTD) soon evolved to include an Office of Intelligence (within CTD) in 2002. The 9/11 Commission recommended strengthening efforts to recognize the role intelligence played within the FBI's structure.
