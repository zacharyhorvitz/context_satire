Middleton High School is a public secondary school located in the city of Middleton, Wisconsin. It was established in 1879. Part of the Middleton-Cross Plains School District, the school serves more than 2,000 students in grades 9 to 12 from the Middleton and Cross Plains areas. Middleton High School's mascot is the cardinal. The school closed as it gave way to a more modern high school West Ashley High School. The former school was located West of the Ashley in Charleston, S.C. at 1776 William Kennerty Dr. just off SC Hwy 61. The school opened in 1970 and closed its doors as a high school in 2000. Daniel James Coury was Middleton's principal. An elementary school is responsible for the education of students from grade kindergarten (usually referred to in Nova Scotia as "grade primary") or grade 1 to grade 5 or 6. A number of Nova Scotian schools combine elementary or the later grades of elementary with junior high or the earlier grades of junior high to form what is referred to as a consolidated school. (Note: The term 'consolidated' is also confusingly used in the naming of a few elementary schools too in the province). Finally, a few schools have all grades from kindergarten to 12.
