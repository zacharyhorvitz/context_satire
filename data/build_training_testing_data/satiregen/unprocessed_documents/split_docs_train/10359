Alfred J. R. E. Zucker (January 23, 1852 – August 2, 1913) was a German-American architect, who worked in Galveston, Texas, Mississippi, New York City, and Buenos Aires. Alfred Zucker was born on January 23, 1852, in the town of Freiburg, Silesia, Prussia (since 1945 Świebodzice, Poland). He was educated at the Hannover Polytechnische Schule and the Bauakademie. He worked briefly for the government before immigrating to the United States in 1872, arriving at New York. The Olympia Brewing Company was a brewery in the northwest United States, located in Tumwater, Washington, near Olympia. Founded in 1896 by Leopold Friederich Schmidt, it was bought by G.

Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring is a 2002 American animated fantasy comedy film starring the seven-time Academy Award-winning cat-and-mouse duo Tom and Jerry. Produced by Warner Bros. Animation (making it the first Tom and Jerry production to be made by that company) and Turner Entertainment Co., it was the first made-for-video attempt to recapture the style of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's original film shorts from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as well as the final animated collaboration of both Hanna and Barbera and  Tom and Jerry production the two worked on, as Hanna died on March 22, 2001; the finished film was dedicated to him. The film was originally set for December 2001 release, but was instead released on March 12, 2002 on both VHS and DVD (nearly one year after Hanna's death) due to a preview of the film found on some Warner Home Video DVDs, including the DVD releases of the Scooby-Doo television specials and direct-to-video films.
