 Vice President Joe Biden landed in Iraq Thursday for an unannounced trip. While in Iraq, Biden will meet with political leaders and is "focused on encouraging Iraqi national unity and continued momentum in the fight against ISIL," according to a White House statement, using a different term for ISIS. "The Vice President will also be discussing steps the international community can take to promote Iraq's economic stability and further regional cooperation," the statement continued. "He will also have an opportunity to thank US diplomatic and military personnel for their tremendous service." The M4 carbine is a shorter and lighter variant of the M16A2 assault rifle. The M4 is a 5.56Ã—45mm NATO, air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed carbine. It has a 14.5 in (370 mm) barrel and a telescoping stock. The M4 carbine is extensively used by the United States Armed Forces and is largely replacing the M16 rifle in United States Army and United States Marine Corps combat units as the primary infantry weapon and service rifle. The meaning of the word American in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. American is derived from America, a term originally denoting all of the New World (also called the Americas). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the United States of America. In modern English, American generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification.
