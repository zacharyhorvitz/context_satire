 With the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza holding for a second straight day, the international community is beginning to debate what it means for the decades-old conflict. But violence erupted at the Israeli-Gaza border this morning, already disrupting the peace established less than 48-hours-ago. And with no long-term agreement yet in place between Israel and Hamas, the focus is on how long the delicate truce will last.

Did Yasser Arafat die eight years ago of natural causes or was the 75-year-old Palestinian leader poisoned, as his widow believes? That's the question forensic investigators from at least three nations are trying to answer by testing samples taken from Arafat's body, which was exhumed Tuesday and reburied a short time later. Tests are being performed on those samples for the presence of polonium -- a toxic, radioactive element found on some of his personal belongings earlier this year. For five decades, Arafat was the most prominent face of Palestinian opposition to Israel, first as the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which carried out attacks against Israeli targets, and later as the head of the Palestinian Authority.  The body of former Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat will be exhumed Tuesday and samples taken to be tested for poisoning as part of an inquiry into his 2004 death, an official said Saturday. Forensic experts from France, Switzerland and Russia will each take their own samples for independent analysis, said Tawfiq Tirawi, head of the Palestinian investigation committee. The tomb in the West Bank city of Ramallah will then be closed back up on the same day, Tirawi told a news conference in Ramallah. Arafat will be reburied with a military ceremony, he said.
