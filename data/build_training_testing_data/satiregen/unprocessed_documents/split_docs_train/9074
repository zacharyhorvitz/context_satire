The new theatre was opened by Helena Bonham Carter in 2007 and Grease was its first production in December that year. The Seniors' Window was added to the chapel as part of a refurbishment and rededication. The following year the eco-classroom, a totally self-sustaining building, opened in the Victorian Water Gardens. A new cafe was added to the dining room in 2010. Amazulu were scheduled to be the opening act on the Pyramid Stage on the Saturday, but did not arrive in time. They were subsequently given a slot before General Public, necessitating The Smiths to take the stage earlier than scheduled. Lessons at the school start at 9 am and carry on until 5:30 pm. There are six periods in the day; each lesson is one hour long. Sports practices take place during the lunch break as well as after lessons end. In addition there are two hours' worth of lessons on Saturday mornings.
