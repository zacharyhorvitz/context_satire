Shane's father, Wendell Ray, lettered at Missouri from 1978-1980 at the linebacker position and was a fifth-round draft pick in the 1981 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings, but never played a regular-season game in the NFL. In an interview with Bleacher Report, Shane states that he and his mother were "trying to make it off food stamps." He then goes on to state that his mother "did it all by herself." In March 2019, Peterson had his invitation of a visiting fellowship at Cambridge University rescinded. He had previously said that the fellowship would give him "the opportunity to talk to religious experts of all types for a couple of months", and that the new lectures would have been on Book of Exodus. A spokesperson for the University said that there was "no place" for anyone who could not uphold the "inclusive environment" of the university. After a week, the vice-chancellor Stephen Toope explained that it was due to a photograph with a man wearing an Islamophobic shirt. Peterson considers that the universities should be held as among the most responsible for the wave of political correctness which appeared in North America and Europe. According to Peterson, he watched the rise of political correctness on campuses since the early 1990s. In his view the humanities  have become corrupt and less reliant on science. Instead of "intelligent conversation, we are having an ideological  conversation".
