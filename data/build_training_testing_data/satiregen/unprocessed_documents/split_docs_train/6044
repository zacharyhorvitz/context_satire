 They are the images we can't unsee -- the torches on a college campus and the moment of a car's impact in Charlottesville, the crime scene tape and the vehicles of first responders in Pittsburgh and Thousand Oaks, the swastikas painted on community centers and the screenshots after the fact of dark threats lodged or warning signs missed on social media. But what happens when the image of hate is something else? It may not look so different from what we see in a World War II documentary or an educational curriculum about the Holocaust, wrote Jill Filipovic, but there it was in a photograph, gone viral this week, of Wisconsin high school students giving an apparent Nazi salute before their prom: "a terrifying sight," contended Filipovic, because "right-wing terrorism, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic terrorism, is the biggest domestic terror threat Americans now face." If a picture speaks a thousand words, then the numbers don't lie.  Rachel always thought it was best to hide her religion from her high school students. The trouble started a few years ago when she let slip to a student that she was Jewish. "I found swastikas scribbled in their textbooks, they drew penises around my name on the blackboard, and they'd yell like 'Hey, Jew' at me during class," said Rachel, a teacher in Berlin. "It became harder... to do my job."  The rise of the far right in Europe has brought back to the surface fears that many had hoped were gone forever. There is something chilling about the way in which some countries and politicians have treated people fleeing war and persecution. Emboldened by the justification that their racism and xenophobia is protected under the guise of free speech, hatred is being allowed to flourish -- and it is not being challenged. As with any time of upheaval and political uncertainty when the far right rises, Jews become an easy target.
