 President Donald Trump loves a good show, especially if he's the protagonist. He's the first POTUS to have starred in his own reality television series, and, with President Ronald Reagan (a former actor), arguably the American head of state who has best understood the relationship between visual spectacle and power. Yet Trump's need for that spectacle to revolve primarily around him and include displays of admiring attention puts him in a different category. We know he admires authoritarian leaders, but he seems intent on borrowing from their cults of personality as well.  The former chief of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the decision to cut 80% of its epidemic prevention activities overseas could pose a grave danger to the United States because it "would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world." The CDC informed personnel in the past two weeks that it was discontinuing its work in 39 out of 49 countries where its Center for Global Health helps prevent, detect and respond to dangerous infectious disease threats, such as Ebola and the Zika virus. The agency said it was forced to make the decision because it doesn't expect any new funding for the programs. The cuts were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.  The Winter Olympics start this week in Pyeongchang, South Korea. But don't expect to see hordes of Americans in the bleachers. High travel costs and a shortage of hotel rooms have put Americans off attending the marquee event. Tensions with North Korea haven't helped, either.
