Staunton (/ˈstæntən/ STAN-tən) is an independent city in the U.S. Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 23,746. In Virginia, independent cities are separate jurisdictions from the counties that surround them, so the government offices of Augusta County are in Verona, which is contiguous to Staunton. In August 1855, President Franklin Pierce visited Staunton. He gave a speech at the Virginia Hotel, in which he stated that his "feelings revolted from the idea of a dissolution of the union." He said that "t would be the Iliad of innumerable woes, from the contemplation of which he shrank." Both Jim Dwyer, columnist from The New York Times, and Op Ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote about Staunton's death and the medical errors that preceded it. His father and mother, Ciaran Staunton and Orlaith Staunton, appeared on NBC's Today and the Dr. Oz Show discussing his death, which they stated was due to hospital errors. An investigation by the New York State Department of Health into the death of Rory Staunton revealed that his treatment at NYU Langone Emergency Room in New York City did not meet the basic standards of care.
