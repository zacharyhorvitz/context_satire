Republicanism in Australia is a movement to change Australia's system of government from a constitutional monarchy to a republic. Republicanism was first espoused in Australia before Federation in 1901. After a period of decline after Federation, the movement again became prominent at the end of the 20th century after successive legal and socio-cultural changes loosened Australia's ties with the United Kingdom. Politically, republicanism is officially supported by the Labor Party and the Greens, and is also supported by some Liberal Party members of the Australian parliament. Republicanism in the United Kingdom is the political movement that seeks to replace the United Kingdom's monarchy with a republic. For those who want a non-hereditary head of state, the method by which one should be chosen is not agreed upon, with some favouring an elected president, some an appointed head of state with little power. Others support something akin to the Swiss model, with a directorate functioning as a collective head of state. Monarchy has been the form of government used in the countries that now make up the United Kingdom since the Middle Ages.  The Republican presidential field's Mr. Nice, Herman Cain, vowed to go on the attack early Wednesday morning, after an often sharp-tempered debate among the seven rivals. "They're getting on my last nerve," he told CNN's Carol Costello after opponents criticized his "9-9-9" tax reform plan. Their attacks on him suggest "they don't have a real convincing plan" and that they had not studied his thoroughly, he said after the debate. "Show me your analysis that shows it won't work," said Cain, who is running near the top of the field in several recent polls.
