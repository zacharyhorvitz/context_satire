The 2016 Democratic Party presidential debates occurred among candidates in the campaign for the party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates. In February 2016, Clinton's and Sanders's campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more, for a total of ten. Critics alleged that the small number of debates and the schedule, with four of the ten on Saturday or Sunday nights, were part of the DNC's deliberate attempt to protect the front-runner, Hillary Clinton. The 2016 Democratic Party presidential debates pitted candidates in the race for the Democratic Party's nomination for the President of the United States. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates. Critics alleged that the small number of debates and the schedule, with half of the debates on Saturday or Sunday nights, were part of the DNC's deliberate attempt to protect the front-runner, Hillary Clinton. In February 2016 Clinton's and Sanders's campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more debates for a total of ten.  Bernie Sanders apologized for his aides' breach of Hillary Clinton's proprietary voter data in the opening moments of Saturday's Democratic debate -- and Clinton dropped the issue. The two Democratic presidential hopefuls opted not to air out what has become a messy fight between their campaigns in front of the cameras as they met along with Martin O'Malley in Manchester, New Hampshire, for their third debate of the 2016 race. Instead, Sanders opened the two-and-a-half hour debate by looking at Clinton and saying: "Yes. I'm sorry."
