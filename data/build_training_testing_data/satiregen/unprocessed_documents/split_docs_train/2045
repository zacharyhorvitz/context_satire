 At what point in time was it ever appropriate to use your power over someone else to make them squirm? What circumstance justifies a company knowing about a pile of sexual harassment allegations against the same person, and not firing him? I thought of this Thursday when the allegations against Harvey Weinstein broke. A story in the New York Times laid out accusations against the Hollywood producer of decades of harassment of women -- in an industry in which he has long held considerable power to make and break careers.  Lisa Bloom raised a lot of eyebrows for supporting Harvey Weinstein when The New York Times exposed decades of sexual harassment allegations against him. Bloom spoke on his behalf for two days -- but now she says she's done. "I have resigned as an advisor to Harvey Weinstein," she tweeted on Saturday. "My understanding is that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement." Five days later, on October 10, longtime NBC News correspondent Ronan Farrow reported in The New Yorker further allegations that Weinstein had sexually assaulted or harassed thirteen women, and raped three. Farrow said he had wanted to break the story months earlier with NBC but implied the network was under pressure not to publish, which NBC denied. According to Farrow, sixteen former or current executives and assistants connected with Weinstein said they had witnessed or had been informed of Weinstein's non-consensual sexual advances to women. Four actresses relayed their suspicion that, after rejecting Weinstein's advances and complaining about him, he had them removed from projects or persuaded others to remove them.
