In 2010, Gerwig starred in Noah Baumbach's Greenberg with Ben Stiller, Rhys Ifans, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. In an appraisal of her work in this and other films, The New York Times critic A. O. Scott described Gerwig as an "ambassador of a cinematic style that often seems opposed to the very idea of style." "She seems to be embarked on a project," Scott wrote, "however piecemeal and modestly scaled, of redefining just what it is we talk about when we talk about acting." In 2010, Gerwig made her first talk show appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Wareing said in an interview released after her first episode was broadcast, that she loves playing Kirsty, saying "there are a lot of places she can go, I feel." She said that Kirsty has "a lot of sides to her", meaning there are a lot of directions in which the character could be taken. She said that as not much is known about the character, "there is potential for a lot to come out about her." At first she thought Kirsty was "a bitch", but felt that eventually people may need another side to her and sympathise with her.

Perkins' casting as Ava was officially confirmed on 4 September 2012, when it was announced that viewers would discover that Ava was still alive. Perkins said of her casting, "I am delighted to be joining the show but to be working alongside Ann Mitchell makes it a dream come true.
