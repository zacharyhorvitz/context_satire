The International was selected by Carnegie Museum of Art director John. W. Beatty, on his own in 1896, and after that, in consultation with a group of foreign advisory committees and a jury of award. The jury of award at this time was composed of artists. The exhibition selection system was two-tiered: some artists were invited to participate directly, shipping their work straight to Pittsburgh and bypassing the selection process, while some were invited to submit works to a selection committee, often at their own expense. The museum's origins can be traced to 1886 with Andrew Carnegie's initial concept: "I am thinking of incorporating with the plan for a library that of an art-gallery in which shall be preserved a record of the progress and development of pictorial art in America." Dedicated on November 5, 1895, the art gallery was initially housed in the Carnegie Libraries of Pittsburgh Main Branch in Oakland. Woman VI is placing in the Postwar Abstraction collection in the Carnegie Museum of Art. This painting along with the collection are considering an important part of American art history. The history of Abstract Expressionism is tied closely to the history of postâ€“World War II because it was an art movement that began in the 1940s. During and after World War II, as the center of international power moved to America, expressing itself most directly in New York city, a new art was born.
