In 1976 Card accepted a job as an assistant editor at the Ensign, a magazine published by the LDS Church, and moved to Salt Lake City. While working at Ensign, Card published his first piece of fiction, a short story "Gert Fram," which appeared in the July 1977 fine arts issue of the Ensign under the pseudonym Byron Walley. :157 Over the years Orson Scott Card used at least seven pseudonyms. According to Card he used a pseudonym for "Gert Fram" because he already had three other works appearing in the same issue. Since Ender's Game was published in 1985, author Orson Scott Card had been reluctant to license film rights and artistic control for the novel. Card explained that he had many opportunities through the 1980s and 1990s to sell the rights of Ender's Game to Hollywood studios, but refused when creative differences became an issue. With the formation of Fresco Pictures in 1996 (which Card co-founded), the author decided to write the screenplay himself. In a 1998 interview, Card discussed the process of adapting the novel into a screenplay.
