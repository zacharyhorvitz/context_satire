 Tic Tac wants nothing to do with Donald Trump's latest scandal. In a "hot mic" video from 2005 that was revealed Friday by The Washington Post, the Republican nominee is heard casually making numerous salacious and vulgar comments about women -- before saying he plans to pop a few Tic Tacs, just in case he decides to plant an unwanted kiss on a woman he's about to greet. That namedrop crossed the line, and Tic Tac called Trump out. "Tic Tac respects all women," the company tweeted Saturday.  Hillary Clinton laced into Donald Trump on Monday for living a billionaire's lifestyle while "contributing nothing to our nation," in her first public remarks about a New York Times report that revealed Trump might have avoided paying federal income taxes for close to two decades. Speaking at a campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio, the Democratic presidential nominee attacked her Republican opponent as representing "the same rigged system that he claims he's going to change." "While millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard and paying our fair share, it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation. Imagine that," Clinton said.  Republicans are acting as if they are in a state of shock about their nominee. From the moment that the tape of Donald Trump and Billy Bush discussing women in vulgar terms surfaced on Friday, Republicans have been coming out of the woodwork to denounce his words, trying to separate themselves from his campaign. The Republican National Committee sent out an email to vendors saying they should put a "hold on all projects" in a mailing program devoted to electing Trump. Sen. John McCain, who had backed Trump even though he had mocked his having been captured in war, has now withdrawn his support.
