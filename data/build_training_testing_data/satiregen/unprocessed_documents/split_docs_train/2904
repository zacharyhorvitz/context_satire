 Robert Mueller wants to talk to Donald Trump. The President wants to talk to the special counsel -- so it's a done deal right? Not quite. Trump appeared on Wednesday to make a significant gesture by telling reporters that he wanted to testify to Mueller -- and was ready to do so under oath. Hannity has promoted conspiracy theories, such as casting doubt on Barack Obama's birthplace and the murder of Seth Rich, and falsehoods, including untrue accounts about Hillary Clinton's health. He was an early supporter of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Since Trump's election, Hannity has often acted as a conduit for Trump's messaging, criticizing the media and attacking the special counsel inquiry. He reportedly speaks to the president on the phone most weeknights .  President Donald Trump's attorney, John Dowd, told CNN on Thursday that he is the one to decide if the President will sit down for an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller's team. "I will make the decision on whether the President talks to the special counsel," Dowd said. "I have not made any decision yet. " Sources previously told CNN that Mueller has indicated interest in interviewing the President, and Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to talk with Mueller under oath.
