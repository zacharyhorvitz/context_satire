The creation of Mickey Mouse and subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio which was renamed as The Walt Disney Studio at the Hyperion Studio in 1926. In 1929, it was renamed again to Walt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success. With the profits from Snow White, Walt relocated to a third studio in Burbank, California. This is a list of films produced and released by the U.S. film studio Walt Disney Studios, one of the Walt Disney Company's divisions and one of the "Big Five" major film studios. Here are the films the Walt Disney Studios released from May 19, 1937 to present. This list is only for films released by the Walt Disney Pictures (known as that since 1983, with Never Cry Wolf as its first release), Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (formerly known as Buena Vista Distribution Company  and Buena Vista Pictures Distribution ) and Disney+. The Walt Disney Company first ventured into the television industry as early as 1950, beginning with the one-hour Christmas special, One Hour in Wonderland. This was followed by the 1951 Christmas special, The Walt Disney Christmas Show, the long-running (1954â€“2008) anthology series, The Wonderful World of Disney (which was Disney's first regular series as a whole), the children's variety show The Mickey Mouse Club, and the  1957-1959 adventure series, Zorro. However, one element was missing from Disney's expansion into television: An original animated television series. Until the early 80's, the studio had never produced its own original animated shows in-house, because Walt Disney felt it was economically impossible.
