 Something didn't look right. David Henneberry had been cooped up for hours, stuck inside as police searched for a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. He ventured out for some fresh air after police lifted their order to stay indoors. He looked at the boat parked in his yard.  It was a boat owner's obsession with perfection, making sure his "baby" was stowed just right in his backyard, that led him to discover the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. Contrary to police reports, David Henneberry said the discovery of blood had nothing to do with the inspection of his boat, the Slip Away II, he told CNN affiliate WCVB. During the inspection, he found a bloodied Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, hiding in the boat, he said. Henneberry said he had been obsessing over how two pads had fallen out of the shrink-wrap protecting his boat for the winter.  As the world hunted him, the younger brother suspected in the Boston Marathon bombings acted like any other college sophomore. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was on the campus of University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth every day after the attack until late Thursday, a university official told CNN. Tsarnaev attended classes and dorm parties and went to the gym while the rest of Boston came to a tense standstill. A student at the school told The Boston Globe that she saw Tsarnaev at a party Wednesday night that was attended by some of his friends from intramural soccer.
