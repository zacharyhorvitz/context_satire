 Hillary Clinton clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, according to CNN's delegate and superdelegate count, and will become the first woman in the 240-year history of the United States to lead the presidential ticket of a major political party. A strong showing in Puerto Rico's Democratic primary on Sunday and additional support from superdelegates put Clinton, 68, over the top on Monday night to become the presumptive nominee. She has secured 1,812 pledged delegates and 572 superdelegates for a total of 2,384 delegates -- one more than needed for the nomination. Clinton's delegate count will grow Tuesday when six states, including delegate-rich California and New Jersey, hold contests.  Hillary Clinton made history Monday night -- a landmark achievement she marked in the most muted way possible. The news that she had clinched the Democratic nomination for president and would become the first female presumptive nominee of a major party in the life of the United States unfolded fitfully, not with a bang but with a couple of bumps. It was an anti-climactic climax, another odd moment in a campaign replete with them. The Associated Press surprised the world and its competitors at 8:20 p.m.  Hillary Clinton has won Puerto Rico's Democratic primary, putting her on the cusp of clinching the party's presidential nomination. Clinton is not expected to win all 60 delegates that were at stake Sunday, which would have put her over the top in the nomination battle against rival Bernie Sanders. She remains shy of the 2,383 she needs to win the Democratic nomination. Clinton is closing in on a historic nomination as the first female presidential nominee with one more round of states -- California, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Dakota and Montana -- set to vote Tuesday.
