 Boeing's new CEO says the company must improve its culture and repair its business. Dave Calhoun, who began his post as CEO of Boeing Monday, sent an email to all of Boeing's employees, vowing to listen to them, customers and regulators. "This is a crucial time for Boeing. We have work to do to uphold our values and to build on our strengths," he said.  Dave Calhoun might have the toughest job in corporate America: Fixing Boeing. As he steps into the CEO job on Monday, Calhoun is tasked with winning approval for the 737 Max to fly again, a first step in ending a 10-month crisis that has cost the company billions of dollars. He must also work to regain Boeing's reputation for safety and quality that was badly damaged by the plane's grounding in March following two crashes that killed 346 people. To succeed, Calhoun, a veteran of General Electric, private equity firm Blackstone and media measurement firm Nielsen, will have to win back the trust of a number of groups.  Investigators were scrambling Wednesday to determine the cause of a crash that killed all 176 people on a Ukrainian plane, shortly after it took off from Tehran's international airport. Iranian state media earlier blamed technical issues on the crash and Ukraine ruled out rocket attacks, but officials in both countries have since walked back their statements and are now refusing to speculate on the cause. Questions are swirling over the timing of the incident, which came just hours after Iran fired a number of missiles at two Iraqi bases housing US troops. Eighty-two Iranians, 63 Canadians, and 11 Ukrainians died onboard flight PS752, according to a tweet from Ukrainian foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko.
