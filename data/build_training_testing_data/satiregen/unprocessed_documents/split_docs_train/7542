In March 2016 KitchenAid announced that they will be offering a line of food mixes with a Michigan food company Franzese USA, Inc.. According to their press release KitchenAid is quoted saying “Considering that tens of millions of American kitchens are outfitted with our stand mixers we’re confident that these mixes will become a staple in many pantries.” The first machine to carry the KitchenAid name was the ten-quart C-10 model, introduced in 1918 and built at Hobart's Troy Metal Products subsidiary in Springfield, Ohio. Prototype models were given to the wives of factory executives, and the product was named when one stated "I don't care what you call it, but I know it's the best kitchen aid I've ever had!" They were initially marketed to the farmhouse kitchen and were available in hardware stores. But owing tothe difficulty in convincing retailers to take up the product, the company recruited a mostly female sales force, which sold the mixers door-to-door. In 1985, the company purchased the Chambers Company to incorporate its range of cookers into the KitchenAid brand. After being cleared by a Federal appeals court in January 1986, Whirlpool Corporation was cleared to purchase KitchenAid for $150 million, after initial complaints regarding competition from dishwasher manufacturers White Consolidated Industries and Magic Chef were dismissed. Refrigerators were added to the product line later in 1986. The company used the popularity of celebrity chefs during the late 1980s to seize the chance to expand its customer range.
