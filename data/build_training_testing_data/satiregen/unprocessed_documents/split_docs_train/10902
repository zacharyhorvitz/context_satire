Despite their extremely different personalities, Chip has been close friends with Vida ever since she stuck up for him when they were children. When she was turned into a vampire, he showed a far more serious and intense side of himself in his attempts to save her, including taking on Koragg and Necrolai by himself. He is extremely passionate about being a Ranger, taking it much harder than the others when they failed to save people from Gnatu and berating Nick/Bowen for betraying everything they stood for when he wanted to surrender to Oculous. In 2003, Integrated Health Services Inc., an operator of nursing homes, long-term acute care hospitals and other ancillary healthcare businesses, was acquired by Abe Briarwood Corp. with financial sponsorship from Cammeby's International Ltd., a real estate investment firm that Grunstein advised. Thereafter, in 2004, Grunstein was involved in a second nursing home company acquisition of Mariner Health Care, Inc. Several years later, a lawsuit sprang up involving parties in that transaction. Grunstein agreed that during his extensive civil depositions in the case, he made a false statement and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor perjury charge. The lawsuit was ultimately settled. The other Rangers attempt to deal with Hekatoid, but it proves useless when he steals their powers. During this time, Leelee, Clare, and Phineas sneak into the Underworld to rescue Udonna. While they can do nothing to help her at first, Leelee produces the Snow Staff (stolen from her mother) and the trio use it to revive Udonna. Udonna, now morphed and with magic once again, reappears in Briarwood and the six Rangers combine their powers to defeat Hekatoid once and for all.
