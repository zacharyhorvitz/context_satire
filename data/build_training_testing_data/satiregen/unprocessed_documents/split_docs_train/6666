Previously, Riggle's live comedy work was mostly improvisational and sketch based, but beginning in 2006 he wanted to try something different and decided to work on creating a stand-up comedy act.

Riggle credits John Oliver for first encouraging him to try stand-up while they shared an office together at The Daily Show.
