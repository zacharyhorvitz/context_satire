In addition to Crate & Barrel, Turf served on the boards of directors for Ann Taylor Stores Corp. and the Gucci Group. In 2000, simplehuman was founded by Frank Yang, who immigrated to the United States in 1982 and later started the company with the idea of making a better trash can. He showed his design and received his first orders at the International Home and Housewares Show from retailers such as The Container Store and Bed, Bath & Beyond. The company was originally called Canworks due to its focus on trash cans, but Yang changed the name to simplehuman in 2001 when the company began to broaden its product line into other kitchen and bath tools, such as touch-free sensor pumps and shower caddies, under the tagline “Tools for Efficient Living”. In 2003, simplehuman opened a UK subsidiary in Oxfordshire, England to serve the European market. The first store opened in response to a flourishing of world trade in home furnishings due to the early 1960s round of talks about the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Segals sought out small European companies that were not represented in America and negotiated direct purchases from these factories that could be sold to the consumer while avoiding a wholesaler's markup. To this day, a majority of Crate & Barrel's products are direct imports from Europe, though Thai, Mexican and Indian glass and textiles can also be found in their stores.
