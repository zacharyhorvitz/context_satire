 Republican opponents of White House-backed legislation that would rein in NSA surveillance programs narrowly blocked the Senate from taking up the bill Tuesday after warning it could help terrorists escape detection. On a tally of 58 to 42, a procedural vote failed to get the supermajority 60 votes it needed to advance. Supporters of the USA Freedom Act, a rare mix of liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans, hoped public outrage over the secret mass collection of phone and Internet records -- revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden -- would lead to passage of the reforms. But many opponents argued the changes would hamper the National Security Agency's ability to track nimble and elusive terrorists.  Triumphant Republicans return to Washington Wednesday to prepare for a new era of GOP dominance on both sides of the Capitol. But first, they have to get through a short, final Senate session under Democratic control. The post-election lame duck session should be fast-paced as lawmakers work to clear leftover business, including a must pass bill to fund the government, and other bills to arm Syrian rebels and extend expiring tax breaks. Republican leaders are anxious to start the new Congress in January with a clean slate when they could control as many as 54 seats.  The fate of the controversial Keystone pipeline isn't the only thing at stake during a crucial vote in the Senate on Tuesday. A vote to move forward on legislation approving the pipeline's construction would usher in a new era of animosity between resurgent Republicans in Congress and President Barack Obama. It could also determine the fate of embattled Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, who is pushing the legislation in an uphill battle to fend off a GOP challenger in a runoff election next month. Landrieu is very close to securing the support necessary to advance the legislation.
