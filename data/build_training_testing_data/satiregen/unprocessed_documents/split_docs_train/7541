 Global reaction to the attacks on U.S. diplomatic missions in Egypt and in Libya, where U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed amid Muslim outrage over a film mocking the Prophet Mohammed:  U.S. President Barack Obama:  "Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done."  Anti-American protests continued to flare up in countries around the world overnight, and U.S. embassies are bracing for more violence as the day progresses. Amb. Richard Williamson, Romney campaign senior foreign policy adviser, responds to how the Obama administration is handling the situation on Starting Point this morning. "I think what we're seeing in Yemen and Egypt and Libya is turmoil that's very disturbing, that crowds U.S. interests and, frankly, is part of a pattern where they see less resolve and strength of the United States," Williamson says.  CNN is following new riots in the streets of Cairo this morning, and new debate over whether the attack leading to the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other consulate workers in Libya was a coordinated effort by al Qaeda. House Democratic Whip and Congressman Steny Hoyer from Maryland talks to John Berman and Brooke Baldwin on “Starting Point” this morning to respond to the attacks in Middle East and the politics in the U.S. erupting from it. Congressman Hoyer says he’s sure that every embassy around the world has been put on high alert since the attacks. “I think all of us are dramatically reminded of the violent nature of the societies that are contending to establish democracies or to establish autocratic leaderships in their countries,” he says.
