Storm P took the girls on a boot camp to clean the pores before the other days physical recording. He also taught them how to dress and to adapt in the fashion industry. Both Alexandra and Claudia won a gift cheque for doing the best in the challenge. The day before the shoot the girls were surprised by a visit of their family and friends. The girls travelled to Dublin where they had another runway lesson by Storm P. followed by a casting for fashion designer Jennifer Rothwell. Claudia impressed the most and was booked to walk for Rothwell on the catwalk later the day. It was also revealed that the worst of them would get eliminated. Alexandra, Katarina and Eirin were named bottom three for the casting and a teary Eirin was eliminated. After the selected 15 girls met in Oslo they received their first mail which took them to a hair salon. There they met their new coach Storm P., who informed them that they would receive makeovers. Dasha, the older sister of Katarina was first to burst out in tears with Eirin following soon.
