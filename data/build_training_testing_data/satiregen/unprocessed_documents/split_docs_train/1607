 It took just seconds, but Jeb Bush was already running a mini victory lap at his first campaign event following his well-received debate performance the night before. Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger had just introduced the former Florida governor at a town hall here Friday afternoon, and Bush explained that Kinzinger typically appears on news shows for him the mornings after debates. "Today was a little easier for him than the previous debates," Bush said. The audience, which was packed into a small, lodge-type venue, broke out into laughter and applause. Bush was initially opposed to her son Jeb making a potential bid for the presidency; she believed that other families should have a try at the nation's highest office and that "we've had enough Bushes". However, she reversed her position and appeared in a campaign ad for him. Beginning in February 2016, she began campaigning for him in New Hampshire, an early voting state. Jeb Bush joked that a town hall meeting attended by his mother featured a larger gathering than town halls prior to her involvement.  Former first lady and family matriarch Barbara Bush plans to hit the campaign trail in New Hampshire for her son Jeb, sources close to his presidential campaign told CNN. The 90-year-old wife of President George H.W. Bush and mother of President George W. Bush and Jeb Bush has agreed to visit the Granite State late next week. The details of her schedule are still being finalized.
