On October 6, 2011 Guetta opened a solo exhibition at Opera Gallery in London. The previous night the street outside the gallery was sprayed with paint by RSH as a statement about the false nature of Mr. Brainwash's artwork. When asked about this, Mr. Brainwash declared that he actually really liked the street and thus spray painted and that as long as he stirred reactions from the public/other artists, he judged it a success. The exhibition sold out within two days, with one private collector buying 14 of the 36 artworks on display. Guetta continues to hear more about Banksy—a prominent and particularly secretive artist. His attempts to contact Banksy are unsuccessful, until one day Banksy visits LA without his usual accomplice, who is refused entry to the US. Stuck in LA without a guide, Banksy contacts Fairey, who calls Guetta. Guetta becomes Banksy's guide in LA, later following him back to England, winning the privilege to film Banksy on his home turf—a feat that confuses Banksy's crew. Despite all this, however, the show becomes a raging success with the crowd, and after the first week of the show, Guetta sells almost a million dollars' worth of art, with his pieces showing in galleries all around the world, to the utter confusion of both Fairey and Banksy. In an ending montage, Guetta insists that time will tell whether he is a real artist or not. Banksy states he will never again help someone make a documentary.
