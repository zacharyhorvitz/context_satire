 President Barack Obama railed Thursday against Republicans who have withdrawn their support for Donald Trump only after his vulgar boasts about grabbing women, saying the last year of insulting statements from the GOP nominee should have prompted them never to support Trump in the first place. "They don't get credit for at the very last minute when finally, the guy they nominated and supported is caught on tape saying things that no decent person would even think, much less say, much less brag about, much less act on," Obama said during remarks at a Democratic dinner in Columbus, Ohio. "You can't wait until that finally happens and then say that's too much and then think somehow you're showing any kind of leadership and deserve to be elected to the United States Senate." Obama was speaking as the GOP confronts widespread defections after Trump's lewd comments emerged last weekend.  President Barack Obama condemned Donald Trump's sexually aggressive and lewd comments caught on tape a decade ago calling them "disturbing" and remarking that he wouldn't repeat the language as there were children in the room. "One of the most disturbing things about this election is just the unbelievable rhetoric coming at the top of the Republican ticket," Obama said at a campaign event in Chicago for Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, who is running for the Senate. "I don't need to repeat it. There are children in the room."  Faced with two presidential candidates he considers unacceptable, Sen. John McCain is thinking of throwing his support behind one of his best pals. "I think I might write in Lindsey Graham," McCain said Monday at a debate against his challenger in the Arizona senate race, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick. "He's an old, good friend of mine and a lot of people like him. The fact is I can't, seriously, I cannot vote for either one."
