Many generations of campers have come and gone, but it wasn't until the 2005 season that the students had a name for their tent-city. In anticipation of the 2005 clash between #16 Penn State and #6 Ohio State, students began camping six days in advance of the game outside the gate so that they would get a first row seat for, arguably, the biggest game of the 2005 season for Penn State. On Tuesday of the week preceding the game, "Paternoville" first appeared. Credited with the naming, freshman Dan Clark and the other students camping with him created a banner reading "Paternoville." He served as the Principal and a Professor of Education at the Kendall Academy, a precursor to the University of Tulsa. He served as the President of Central State Teacher's College, later known as the University of Central Oklahoma, in Edmond for four years. He gave the graduation address at his alma mater, Austin College, in 1936. He served as the President of the Oklahoma State Council on Christian Education in 1939.
