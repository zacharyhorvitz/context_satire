On March 6, 2017, the Raiders revealed that Bank of America would be replacing Sheldon Adelson's portion of the funding for the new stadium in Las Vegas. On March 27, 2017, the National Football League officially approved the Raiders move from Oakland to Las Vegas in a 31–1 vote, with the Miami Dolphins being the only team to vote against the measure. However, even though the Raiders were approved to move to Las Vegas, the club still played the 2017, 2018 and 2019 NFL seasons at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum and will still be known as the Oakland Raiders as long as they play in the San Francisco Bay Area. The team expects the new stadium to open in 2020. The Raiders officially filed paperwork with the NFL on January 19, 2017, to relocate the club from Oakland to Las Vegas, Nevada by the 2020 season. The vote for the team's relocation took place on March 27, 2017, and the NFL officially approved the Raiders' relocation to Las Vegas by a 31–1 vote. Only the Miami Dolphins dissented the proposed move. Subsequently, the team announced that it would continue to be known as the Oakland Raiders for the 2017 and 2018 NFL seasons and play its games in Oakland for at least those two seasons. The Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas saw the Oakland Raiders, an American football club in the National Football League (NFL), move from its longtime home of Oakland, California, to Las Vegas, Nevada. The renamed Las Vegas Raiders are to play home games at Allegiant Stadium, which is to open in July 2020; if construction is delayed, the Raiders may elect to play in Oakland for the 2020 season before April 1, 2020.
