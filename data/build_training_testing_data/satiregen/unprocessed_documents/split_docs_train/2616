 Fresh off a blistering loss over health care, many lawmakers are cautiously optimistic their party can be more successful in overhauling the US tax code, a system they say is seriously lacking in popularity and in dire need of change. Fewer than 24 hours after Republicans were forced to pull the plug on their second effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, the party released a framework, held a bicameral news conference and discussed details about how they plan to revamp the tax code. "Have you seen what we're doing? There wasn't even a bathroom break between health care and taxes," said Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski.  By Monday afternoon, it was the worst-kept secret on Capitol Hill: the latest GOP health care bill was headed for failure. Even before Sen. Susan Collins of Maine officially opposed the bill, Republican aides spoke knowingly about its impending death. Senators talked openly of new ways and avenues to take another crack at repealing President Barack Obama's cornerstone domestic achievement. One Republican senator, speaking to CNN, repeatedly referred to the bill in the past tense.  The Senate will not vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill to repeal Obamacare, Republican leaders announced Tuesday, dealing a devastating blow to President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers who tried to make a last-ditch attempt to deliver on the party's years-long campaign promise. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the decision at a lunch with fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill, conceding what had become clear Monday night: They didn't have the votes. "We haven't given up on changing the American health care system. We are not going to be able to do that this week," McConnell told reporters Tuesday.
