Alister Cullen is the Vicar General of the Order of Saint Michael. Born in 858, the young Deryni trains for the life of a religious knight from childhood, eventually being ordained a priest in 877 and joining the Michaelines in 879. He is elected Vicar General of the order in 901, and he still holds the position at the time of his first appearance in Camber of Culdi. Cullen enjoys a close friendship with Grand Master Jebediah d'Alcara, and he serves as a mentor to Father Joram MacRorie. Rhys Malachy Thuryn is a highly talented Deryni Healer and the son-in-law of Earl Camber MacRorie of Culdi. Through his connection to the MacRorie family, he plays a central role in the Haldane Restoration, and he is later a founding member of the Camberian Council. In addition, he is the inventor of a Deryni meditation practice known as "the Thuryn technique." Murdoch is one of the primary antagonists in the various novels in which he appears. He successfully petitions King Cinhil Haldane for the restoration of his family lands, and he is created Baron of Carthane in 905, though he is later promoted to an earl in 907. Following Cinhil's death in 917, Murdoch becomes one of the Regents for young King Alroy and is appointed to the Royal Council. In addition, it is Murdoch's successful alteration to Cinhil's will that enables the human members of the council to force almost all Deryni from court.
