 San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz said that if the perfect "10" President Donald Trump gave his administration for its response to Hurricane Maria was right, it must be a 10 out of 100. "If it is a 10 out of a scale of 100, of course, it is still a failing grade," she said, speaking on CNN's "New Day" on Friday. Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico on September 20. The mayor, who has been an outspoken critic of the President, also accused him of living in his own world.  President Donald Trump said Thursday that Puerto Rico faced a situation "worse than Katrina" as he explained why he was rating his administration's response to the hurricane a 10 out of 10. "It was probably the most difficult when you talk about relief, when you talk about search, when you talk about all the different levels. Even when you talk about lives saved," Trump told the press during a White House meeting with Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell√≥.  Whitefish Energy, a little-known energy firm based in Montana, has been stirring up controversy ever since it announced last week that it landed a $300 million contract to help restore Puerto Rico's electrical power. The contract is the largest to be awarded since recovery efforts began over a month ago. And several lawmakers on Capitol Hill are calling for government reviews of how this small firm with only two employees at the time Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico was chosen over bigger, more established utilities. The seeds of the deal were first sown after Hurricane Irma, which tore through the Caribbean and Florida in early September.
