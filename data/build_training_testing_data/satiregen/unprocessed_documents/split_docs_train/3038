With its mixture of monologue-interspersed ballads and uptempo tracks with a Latin feel, The Right Night & Barry White did not stray far from White's familiar sound. Critical opinion suggested that this kind of R&B was simply not in vogue in 1987 and that while the album would sell to hardcore White fans, it was unlikely to reach a significant new audience. This indeed proved to be the case, as the album was another commercial disappointment for White, peaking at #28 on the R&B chart and failing to reach the top 100 on the pop chart. Lead single "Sho' You Right" made #17 on the R&B chart and gave White his first UK top 20 hit since 1978. In 1973, White created The Love Unlimited Orchestra, a 40-piece orchestral group to be used originally as a backing band for the girl-group Love Unlimited. However, White had other plans, and in 1973 he released a single with "Love's Theme" (written by him and played by the Orchestra). That same track reached #1 on the Billboard Pop charts. Later, in 1974, he made the first album of the Love Unlimited Orchestra, Rhapsody in White, containing "Love's Theme". "Practice What You Preach" is the title of a number-one R&B single by singer Barry White, written by Barry White, Gerald Levert, Edwin Nicholas, from White's 1994 album The Icon Is Love. The hit song spent three weeks at number-one on the US R&B chart and reached 18 on the pop chart. It became a gold record. The 1994 single also won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Song of the Year.
