Dean Foods products include milk, ice cream, dairy products, cheese, juice, and teas. It processes milk in the United States under a number of regional and national brands. Among the smallest of the dairy breeds, the average Jersey cow matures at approximately 410 kilograms (900 lb), with a typical weight range between 360 and 540 kilograms (800–1,200 lb). According to North Dakota State University, the fat content of the Jersey cow's milk is 4.9 percent. It is also the highest in protein, at 3.8 percent. This high fat content means the milk is often used for making ice cream and cheeses. Carvel introduced the Lil' Love ice cream cake on March 30, 1998.

A mother presents the new cake to celebrate. All ads carry the tag line Surprise someone special tonight.
