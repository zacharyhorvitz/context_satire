It is revealed that in her final year of law school, Novak was engaged to a man, Charlie, who suffered from schizophrenia. She ended the relationship when his symptoms became so severe she felt she was no longer safe with him. In 2002, Charlie attacked her in her home during a psychotic episode. She convinced the police not to press charges, but ended the relationship. Novak has a close friendship with Mindy Kaling, whom he met through writing for The Office. The two dated on and off while writing and acting on the show, sometimes mirroring the on-again, off-again nature of the relationship between their respective characters Ryan Howard and Kelly Kapoor. He served as a consulting producer for Season 1 of The Mindy Project, and has appeared on the show several times, though his formal producing role ended after the first season. Novak is the godfather of Kaling's daughter, Katherine. In the season 6 episode "Goliath", Novak states that she is a big supporter of the U.S military. She explains that her father was an M60 door gunner on a Huey during the Vietnam War. His helicopter crashed three times, and he received a Purple Heart.
