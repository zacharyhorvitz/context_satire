 As the strongest hurricane to make landfall in the US in more than a decade took aim at Texas, President Donald Trump's White House engaged in an age-old Washington tradition: the Friday news dump. Transgender individuals? Banned from joining the military. Convicted Sheriff Joe Arpaio?  Hurricane Harvey is destined to be the first major homeland security and emergency management crisis the Trump administration has faced. And, ironically, it is at this moment that President Donald Trump will be judged on how well he lets a bureaucracy he so often maligns or denigrates actually do its job. By all accounts, Hurricane Harvey will deliver a gut punch of rain, wind and storm surges in Texas. And though weather, like a teenager's mood, is unpredictable, this storm is not slowing down -- it is rapidly gaining strength, and forecasters say it's likely to be a Category 3 hurricane when it makes landfall.  The Coldplay concert schedule for Friday in Houston has been postponed due to Hurricane Harvey. The British band took to Twitter and their own website on Friday afternoon to make the announcement, saying, "We really wanted to play tonight, but sitting here all together watching the news about the storm we feel that we can't ask anyone to put their safety at risk." The concert was scheduled to take place at Houston's NRG Stadium. The band added that would give details regarding rescheduling and refunding as soon they could and that they are "really sorry for the inconveniences this will cause."
