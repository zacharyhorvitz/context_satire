 South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham thinks his party has gone "bats---" crazy, and joked Thursday that it's possible to get away with murdering Ted Cruz if it happened in the Senate. "If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you," the former presidential candidate said at the Washington Press Club Foundation's 72nd Congressional Dinner, referencing the Texas senator's unpopular reputation on Capitol Hill. CNN has reached out to Cruz's presidential campaign for comment. While Graham teased Democrats and other politicians in the room -- at one point turning to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and asking her not leave to leave for the sake of his own party -- he focused his roast on the 2016 election and the GOP field, in which he formerly participated.  The remaining five Republican candidates will gather in Houston on Thursday for the final presidential primary debate before a slew of states cast their ballots on Super Tuesday.

Here is everything you need to know to watch this event: When is it? The debate will take place on Thursday, February 25, at the University of Houston's Moores School of Music Opera House.  Everything's bigger in Texas -- and that's true of the stakes at CNN's Republican debate in Houston at 8:30 p.m. ET Thursday night, just days before Super Tuesday. Donald Trump will take center stage as the dominant front-runner, with three victories now under his belt. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are hoping to slow down the New Yorker's momentum and claim some wins of their own.
