 The Cincinnati Police Department said Wednesday it has finished investigating the fatal shooting of an apparently unarmed black man by a University of Cincinnati police officer. Officer Ray Tensing fatally shot Samuel Dubose, 43, on Sunday after a struggle at a traffic stop over a missing license tag, Cincinnati police said. Dubose was driving away when Tensing shot him in the head, police said. Investigators will present the evidence to Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters, who will decide if any criminal charges are warranted,  according to a press release issued Wednesday.  University of Cincinnati Police Officer Ray Tensing was indicted Wednesday on a murder charge in the shooting death of Samuel DuBose. If convicted, Tensing could go to prison for life, Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters said in a news conference. Deters played body camera footage of the traffic stop shooting that appeared to contradict Tensing's version of what happened. "I've been doing this for over 30 years.  After shooting dead an apparently unarmed man during a traffic stop, a University of Cincinnati police officer said he'd almost been run over and "had to fire his weapon," according to a police incident report released Thursday. In the report, another University of Cincinnati police officer, who said he responded to the scene after hearing screams of "shots fired" over the radio, describes what Officer Ray Tensing told him about the shooting. "Officer Tensing stated that he almost was run over by the driver of the Honda Accord and was forced to shoot the driver with his duty weapon (Sig Sauer P32). Officer Tensing stated that he fired a single shot.
