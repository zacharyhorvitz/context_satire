Mommy blogger Stephanie Ward is asked a favor by her best friend, Emily Nelson, one day to help pick up Emily's son after school. Emily never shows up to collect her son from Stephanie however, and after days of searching, she is believed to have been found dead. Stephanie starts digging deeper into Emily's secrets as she seeks to uncover the truth. Stephanie lures Emily into meeting her through cryptic messages on her vlog hinting when she would be at Emily's gravesite. Emily explains that she is Hope and that she and her sister started the fire to kill their abusive father. The two fled and planned to reunite later, but Faith never appeared. Emily worked hard building a career and a family when, 14 years later, Faith contacted her. Emily has a work crisis and asks Stephanie to babysit her son while Sean is in London attending to his injured mother. After two days with Emily not returning her calls, Stephanie calls Emily's employer, Dennis Nylon, and is told that Emily is in Miami. Stephanie then calls Sean, who contacts the police. Trying to solve her disappearance, Stephanie looks for answers by sneaking into Emily's office.
