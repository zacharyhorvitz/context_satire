Over the years Colorado State University has had a few different mascots. In 1919 there was a black bear cub that served as the mascot not much was known about the cub. It was unknown where the bear came from or even its name, just as he mysteriously appeared, he disappeared the same year. He was replaced by Peanuts the Bulldog in 1912.  In the next few days, every doctor in the United States will be receiving this letter (PDF) from the US surgeon general. It's the first time that America's top doctor has reached out to all physicians. But Dr. Vivek Murthy has an urgent reason: Americans are dying each year by the tens of thousands from overdoses of prescription painkillers such as Oxycontin and Vicodin. "I am asking for your help to solve an urgent health crisis facing America: the opioid epidemic," Murthy wrote. By 1892, the last two years of classes were taught in Denver because the larger population afforded more practical experience. This triggered a turf battle with the private medical school at the University of Denver, and the resulting legal battle went all the way to the Supreme Court of Colorado. In 1897, the Supreme Court found that the charter of the University of Colorado restricted it to teaching in Boulder.
