 In the wake of Democratic Sen. Al Franken's resignation, some of his accusers of sexual misconduct told CNN they are disappointed with his defense of the allegations, saying he shouldn't have continued to dismiss them. Leeann Tweeden, the California radio morning show anchor who accused Franken of forcibly kissing her and groping her, said she is not celebrating Franken's resignation. "I'm not celebrating his resignation. It's a lose-lose situation," she said in a phone call with CNN.  Two things were clear after Al Franken finished his speech on the Senate floor just after noon on Thursday: 1. He was resigning his seat by the end of the year. 2. He didn't believe he had done anything for which he should have been forced to resign. Looking back on the accusations and his subsequent resignation, Franken has said that he is deeply sorry that he made some women feel uncomfortable and that while he is still trying to understand what he did wrong, he feels that differentiating different kinds of behavior is important. "The idea that anybody who accuses someone of something is always right—that’s not the case. That isn’t reality”, he said.
