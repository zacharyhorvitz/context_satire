During part one of the Live Finale on May 21, 2018, she joined her coach, Clarkson, in a coach duet as they sang "Don't Dream It's Over" by Crowded House. She then performed the original song "Walk My Way" written by Julia Michaels, and she closed the night with "Skyfall" by Adele. The following night, she and Michaels performed a duet of "Issues" and "Jump." At the end of the night, Cartelli was named the winner of Season 14 of The Voice over Team Alicia member Britton Buchanan, becoming the youngest contestant to win The Voice. Cartelli was born and raised in Longmeadow, Massachusetts. She began playing piano when she was five and it was her parents who introduced her to classical, country and soul music. In middle school she started taking voice lessons and took up the guitar. In the summer of 2016, she was performing at a restaurant on Jetties Beach in Nantucket with a local islander when a bartender posted a video of her playing to Facebook. With Chevel Shepherd's victory, this marks Kelly Clarkson's second consecutive victory as a coach and makes her the only rotating coach who has won more than once, as well as the third coach overall to win more than once. In addition, Shepherd's victory marks the first victory by a country artist who was not, at any point in time, coached by Blake Shelton, meaning that Clarkson also became the first coach to defeat Shelton with a country artist, a goal that, strangely enough, Adam Levine had attempted, with no success, in several different seasons.
