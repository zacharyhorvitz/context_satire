U.S.U.R.A. was started by Time Records owner Giacomo Maiolini, producers Walter Cremonini and Alessandro Gilardi. The name is derived from that of Maiolini's mother, Ursula. The group is best known for the 1992-93 hit single (and later album) "Open Your Mind", featuring a dialog sample from the film Total Recall, as well as from "Solid" by Ashford & Simpson (that famous 'owh') and incorporating sampled elements from the Simple Minds song "New Gold Dream" from 1982. The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation. After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of d√©tente, he abandoned "containment" and initiated the more aggressive "rollback" strategy towards the USSR. After a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade, by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (IATA: DCA, ICAO: KDCA, FAA LID: DCA), also known as Reagan National Airport, or, more simply, Washington National, Reagan Airport or National Airport, is an airport in Arlington, Virginia, located adjacent to the border of Washington, D.C. It is the smaller of two commercial airports operated by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority that serve the National Capital Region (NCR) around Washington, D.C. (the larger airport being Washington Dulles International Airport approximately 30 miles (48 km) to the west in Virginia's Fairfax and Loudoun counties). The airport is just five miles from downtown Washington, D.C. and the border is visible from the airport, making it the nearest and most convenient commercial airport to the capital. The airport's original name was Washington National Airport.
