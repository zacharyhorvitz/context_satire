Hank Tate (Hugh Dane), also known as Hank the security guard, is head of security at the office park. Hank is quiet and stern, and unenthusiastically carries out his duties from his desk at the front door of the office park. Since Dwight purchased the building, Hank's duties have expanded to include running the ramshackle coffee counter that was installed in the lobby. He is first seen sitting at his desk as Michael exits the building at the end of "Halloween". William "Billy" Merchant (Marcus A. York) is the property manager of Scranton Business Park, the office park in which the Dunder-Mifflin Scranton branch office is located. Billy is physically disabled, and has used a wheelchair since the age of four. Throughout his appearances, he is seen as a calm and professional man, and seems to disregard Michael's immaturity and rudeness, while still extending generosity to him. He first appears in "The Injury", where, after Michael burns his foot on a George Foreman Grill, he invites Billy to the office to speak about being disabled, only for Michael to offend him with his remarks, causing Billy to leave. Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) was a sales representative at the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the Dunder Mifflin paper and office-supply company. She originally worked at the company's branch in Stamford, Connecticut, but transferred to the Scranton branch after her boss, Josh Porter, left (in order to take an upper-management job at Staples) and the branch shut down to merge with the Scranton branch. During her time in Stamford, she became romantically interested in Jim, and upon their arrival to the Scranton branch following Stamford's closing, they began dating. Shortly after, however, Jim's recurring affections for Pam led to their breakup, and Karen's immediate departure from Scranton.
