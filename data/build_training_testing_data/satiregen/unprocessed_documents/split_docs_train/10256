The new owners of Toys "R" Us want to bring the brand back to the United States. But they can't say when it will happen.

Congressional districts are apportioned to states by population using the United States Census results, provided that each state has at least one congressional representative. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators. Currently, there are 100 senators representing the 50 states.
