 I am a black man, but the next time I fly, I don't plan to avoid American Airlines, despite the travel advisory the NAACP released this week about possible discrimination against black people by that airline. It's hard to be alarmed by the advisory, given the paucity of evidence the revered civil rights organization has so far presented -- and because we are living in volatile times during which profound questions about racial and other forms of inequality are popping up everywhere. The advisory seems trivial by comparison. During times like these, there's only so much moral bandwidth available to highlight and combat wrongs where we can prove them. The meaning of the word American in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. American is derived from America, a term originally denoting all of the New World (also called the Americas). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the United States of America. In modern English, American generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification. The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country comprising 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe. Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million, the U.S. is the third most populous country.
