Jebediah Townhouse (voiced by William Salyers) is a minor character in the show. He makes his debut in the episode "Terror Tales of the Park III". It is said that he lived in the house 200 years ago and was ahead of his time. More so than most others who are considered ahead of their time, since he acted and spoke like it was the 1980s. Aside from being a rich businessman, Richard (voiced by J. G. Quintel) had a main purpose in life: to have Thanksgiving all by himself. In The Thanksgiving Special, Richard wanted to win the prized turducken from the Thanksgiving Song Contest, so he entered the contest with a song he paid a lot of musicians to sing (although most of them weren't even musicians): Chewing On Freedom. Just as he was about to win the turducken, to his dismay, Mordecai and Rigby came in with their own Thanksgiving song: "What Are You Thankful For?". Richard was so disappointed that their song was better than his own, so he decided to steal the turducken from them since Farmer Jimmy wouldn't let him buy it. Barbara (voiced by Courtenay Taylor in the first two appearances, Ali Hillis in later appearances) and Sherm (voiced by William Salyers in the first appearance, Eddie Pepitone in later appearances) are Rigby's parents. They first appeared on The Thanksgiving Special. Not much is known about Rigby's parents, but they seem very proud of Rigby, even though he is lazy and rarely gets things done. When Rigby was in high school, he was expelled and his mother had to come pick him up.
