In 2009, marketing staffer Peter Costanzo suggested to Trump that he could use social media to draw attention to his book, Think Like a Champion, which was due to be released later that year. He was unable to use the username @DonaldTrump, as it was already being used by a parody account. He and his marketing team decided to use the username @realDonaldTrump. Trump joined Twitter in March 2009 and sent out his first tweet on May 4, 2009, advertising his upcoming appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, which was due to air a couple of days later.  One simple tweet can help push the start button for action, thanks in part to the viral nature of social media. Luke Crane, who says he works at Kickstarter and describes himself as a self-publisher of role-playing games, floated out a question on Monday evening: "Why are there so few lady game creators?" His inquiry touched on a controversy that's been brewing for a long time. Women's role in the gaming industry is part of a greater conversation about gender roles and stereotypes in the scientific, techie and geek spheres. Twitter was an important political communication tool of Trump's presidential election campaign in 2016, and has been credited as contributing to his victory. Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci recalled that Trump “felt that there was no separation between his brand and the media, that there was an intersection of value for himself personally between his brand and saturating it in the media”. Dan Pfeiffer, Obama's former digital and social media guru, commented that Donald Trump is "way better at the internet than anyone else in the GOP which is partly why he is winning". Other presidential aides have described Trump “as a sophisticated version of a parrot, given his penchant for repeating information almost unfiltered, as soon as he had processed it.”
