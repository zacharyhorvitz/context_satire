Showgirl Clara Phillips has a happy marriage with husband Armor, but when a neighbor tells Clara about Armor talking to a recently-widowed woman named Alberta Meadows, it causes her to snap even though there is no evidence they are having an affair. On July 10, 1922, Clara and friend Peggy Caffee hitch a ride with Alberta to a secluded location where Clara bashes Alberta with a hammer. She was sentenced to 10 years to life and was released after 12 years. She is dubbed "Tiger Lady" because of how brutal the crime was. Cornetts were used to reinforce the human voice in choirs, and many commentators suggested that the sound of a well-played cornett, heard at a distance, could be mistaken for a "choice castrato". The place of the cornett was never really filled by any other instrument and it was not until the second half of the 20th century that the cornett revival gave music lovers a chance to hear the sound of this instrument again in its proper context.
