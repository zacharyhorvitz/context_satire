On May 5, 2014 during the show "Way Too Early", a segment was done about the historical background of Cinco De Mayo and featured Louis Burgdorf dancing around the set in a sombrero, shaking maracas and drinking tequila, which host Thomas Roberts referred to as "go-go juice". The segment came under quick criticism for its mocking of Mexican heritage and use of false stereotypes. MSNBC apologized the next day, saying there was no intention to be disrespectful and that while the props were planned, Roberts and Burgdorf acted the way they did on their own. The two hosts also apologized, although they partially deflected the blame back at their producers for allowing the segment to begin with. "Live" is the flagship daytime news platform of NBC News, airing for at least six hours each day on MSNBC. Focusing on live news coverage, the program consists of guest analysis and interviews around the stories of the day, in addition to feature-like stories, in-depth special reports and forecasts from The Weather Channel. When a story is deemed as breaking news or a special event, MSNBC producers have the discretion to replace any anchor with MSNBC Chief Anchor Brian Williams. Others have argued that MSNBC has a bias against progressive politics. Phil Donahue's show was canceled in 2003 due to his opposition to the Iraq War, and Donahue later commented that the management of MSNBC required that "we have two conservative (guests) for every liberal. I was counted as two liberals." Cenk Uygur, after his departure from MSNBC in 2011, said that MSNBC management had told him "people in Washington" were "concerned about  tone," and that he "didn't want to work in a place that didn't challenge power."
