Lucile Garner, later Lucile Garner Grant, (1910â€“2013) was Canada's first flight attendant. In this capacity she was the first woman to be employed by Trans-Canada Air Lines (later renamed Air Canada), where she worked from 1938 to 1943. She also designed TCA's first inflight uniform in 1938. At first it was beige to match the airplane interior, and she was asked not to make it navy blue because pilots wore navy blue, but the beige was disliked by many and so by 1939 it was navy blue, although that created controversy with the pilots.She was a trained nurse, which was part of her qualifications as a flight attendant.
