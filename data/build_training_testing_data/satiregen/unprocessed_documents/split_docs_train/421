On August 27, 2018, one day after Jacksonville Landing shooting, Washington Post published a profile of the perpetrator. After this article was published, Nicole Dahmen, a journalism professor at the University of Oregon criticizes it, saying “The article reads like a glorified celebrity profile,” “Why does it give us eight paragraphs of what a celebrity, high-profile gamer he is?”. The paper refused to make a reporter or editor available for comment. Molly Gannon Conway, a communications manager with it, emailed the following statement: “As is true in all cases, reporting on the alleged killer is only one aspect of our coverage. During a town hall event in August 2019, Vermont senator and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders criticized the Washington Post's perceived negative coverage of his campaign tying it to Jeff Bezos purchase of the newspaper, stating “I talk about that all of the time. And then I wonder why The Washington Post—which is owned by Jeff Bezos who owns Amazon—doesn’t write particularly good articles about me.” In response on CNN, Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron claimed that Sanders' criticism was "baseless and conspiratorial". In addition to the Sanders campaign, both the leftist magazine Jacobin and the progressive journalist watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting issued similar criticism of the Washington Post. According to historian T.H. Breen, Washington "enhanced the legitimacy" of the U.S. Constitution. Breen said Washington "brought immense political capital to the presidency. He may have been the most charismatic person ever to hold the office.
