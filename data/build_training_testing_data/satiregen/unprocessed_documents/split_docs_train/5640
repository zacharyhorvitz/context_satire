After discovering that Wes is the Red Time Force Ranger, Eric attempts to find his own powers. He becomes aware that the Time Force Power Rangers are looking for the Quantum Ranger power and he gets to it first, registering his voice on the Quantum Morpher so only he can use it. When Wes attempts to retrieve the Quantum Morpher from him out of general distrust by the Time Force team, he and Eric fight; the latter wins. As a result, the Rangers have no choice but to accept his control of the Morpher. Eric becomes a reluctant ally to the regular Rangers, remaining separate and occasionally aiding them at certain times. His peers often find his methods intimidating, but deep down they know he is almost always taking the best approach. Unlike Wes, Eric works alone and does not let someone like Jen push him around. Eric acts more like lone wolf leader. Trip looks up to the other Rangers, but is a good Ranger in his own right. He is also a technological genius, having created the Electro Booster weapon and other arsenal. He can be considered the brains of the team. He is also rumored to have created the robotic owl Circuit, but this has never been confirmed.
