 If you've been holding out for a giant iPad, you're going to have to wait a little longer. Apple has been rumored to be working on a 12.9-inch iPad for ages, and there were grumblings that the company might finally unveil its bigger tablet at the Apple Watch event on Monday. But multiple news reports suggest that the big iPad now won't be available until the fall. On the surface, a giant iPad seems like a head-scratching move for Apple.  The Apple Watch, Apple's first major consumer device in years, is finally here. Apple CEO Tim Cook teased it in September. And on Monday, he revealed the last remaining details during an event in San Francisco Monday. "I've been wanting to do this since I was 5 years old, the day is finally here," Cook said about the watch's ability to make and receive phone calls.  Apple CEO Tim Cook has released the much-anticipated Apple watch -- his company's first new product since the iPad. Cook said the new watch, in addition to telling the time, was a "comprehensive health and fitness companion." But we're unlikely to hear much about how people will actually use this new product for some time. Our research has found that smartwatches certainly do have some benefits for users.
