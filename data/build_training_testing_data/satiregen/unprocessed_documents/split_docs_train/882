Now it has made that rare apology to Chinese-Americans for discriminatory laws adopted 130 years ago.

In 2010, 36% of new immigrants were Asians compared to 31% for Hispanics, according to a report released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center. That's a significant change from a decade ago, when 19% of immigrants were Asians and 59% were Hispanics.
