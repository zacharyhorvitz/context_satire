Recent studies show that the surface epithelial layer of the cornea heals faster if the epithelial sheet is removed at the end of surgery. This means that the original rationale for carefully cleaving the epithelium with the aim of replacing it at the end of surgery is flawed. It is better in fact to discard the epithelial layer at the end of surgery, thus making epi-LASIK no different from traditional photorefractive keratectomy surgery. After the laser has reshaped the stromal layer, the LASIK flap is carefully repositioned over the treatment area by the surgeon and checked for the presence of air bubbles, debris, and proper fit on the eye. The flap remains in position by natural adhesion until healing is completed. Large Pupils: These can cause symptoms such as glare, halos, starbursts, and ghost images (double vision) after surgery. Because the laser can only work a section of the eye, the outer ring of the eye is left uncorrected. At night or when dark, a patient's eyes dilate and thus the uncorrected outer section of the eye and the inner corrected section, create the problems.
