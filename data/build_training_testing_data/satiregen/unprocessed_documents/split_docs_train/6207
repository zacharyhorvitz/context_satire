In October 2017, The New York Times and The New Yorker reported that dozens of women accused American film producer Harvey Weinstein, formerly of Miramax Films and The Weinstein Company (TWC), of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse over a period of at least thirty years. Over eighty women in the film industry have since accused Weinstein of such acts. Weinstein denied "any non-consensual sex." Shortly after, he was dismissed from TWC, expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other professional associations, and retired from public view.  The British Film Institute has stripped disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of a prestigious fellowship. "The serious and widespread allegations about Harvey Weinstein's appalling conduct are in direct opposition to the BFI's values," the organization said in a statement. It's the first time the association has ever revoked its highest award. Weinstein has been publicly rebuked by numerous industry organizations following a wave of sexual harassment allegations against the Hollywood titan.  The entertainment industry is turning its back on Harvey Weinstein. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) has suspended Weinstein's membership following a wave of sexual harassment allegations against the Hollywood titan. "Whilst BAFTA has previously been a beneficiary of Mr. Weinstein's support for its charitable work, it considers the reported alleged behavior completely unacceptable and incompatible with BAFTA's values," the organization said in a statement on Wednesday. BAFTA, which hosts an annual awards show, is the British equivalent of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
