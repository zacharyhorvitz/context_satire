 Americans' confidence in the economy is turning south even though things are looking up. More Americans are finding jobs, wages are starting to grow faster and people are spending selectively. But American confidence has declined. What gives?  The middle class has been shrinking in nearly every state in the nation, but in most places, more people have moved up the ladder than down, according to a new Stateline analysis. The upward movement, however, comes with a huge caveat: Families that have risen above the middle class may still be doing worse than they were in 2000 because median income has declined in all but four states, after adjusting for inflation. "People are shifting out of that middle category to a higher category, but whether they're better off or not is not as clear," said Harry Holzer, a Georgetown University professor and the chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor during the Clinton administration. The "middle class" includes people making between two-thirds and twice a state's median household income, based on a definition developed by the Pew Research Center.  The lanes of Dharavi are long and winding. Spread over roughly 500 acres in the heart of Mumbai, they connect the shanties of this informal settlement, home to about one million people. But Dharavi is much more than one of Asia's largest slums. It is a hive of small-scale industries.
