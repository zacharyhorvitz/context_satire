 Brexit might never happen if lawmakers vote down the deal the British government has negotiated with the European Union, British Prime Minister Theresa May warned on Monday. Making a last-minute plea to save her beleaguered deal, May warned that a rejection in parliament on Tuesday could destroy people's trust in politics, lead to the reversal of Brexit and even the breakup of the United Kingdom. May urged lawmakers to take a "second look" at her deal, and warned that historians would judge them harshly if they didn't support it. The Prime Minister said that while her deal was "not perfect" and "a compromise," it was the only one that would deliver the Brexit the British people voted for in the 2016 referendum.  So, that's cleared that up. One Brexit option down, only four (by my conservative count) possible scenarios left. Tuesday's historic defeat for Theresa May and her European Union withdrawal plan leaves the British people and their government with 72 days to come up with a Plan B before the March 29 deadline. Will there be fresh elections?  Theresa May has embarked on many crucial weeks in her two-and-a-half-year premiership, thanks to Brexit, but these coming days look set to be the most decisive yet. "We are going to live through an extraordinary week, writing an extraordinary page of our history, and not one of us knows the words on that page, what we will be reading on that page, in seven days' time," British constitutional expert Peter Hennessy said Sunday. The focus will be the vote in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening on the Prime Minister's Brexit deal -- nearly two months after the withdrawal agreement was struck with the European Union. But May's actions in the hours after the vote will be just as pivotal -- and that is the source of the uncertainty alluded to by Lord Hennessy in a BBC radio interview.
