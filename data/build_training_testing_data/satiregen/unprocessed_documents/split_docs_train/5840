When a burned Eddie with the brain dead symbiote arrived to his father, Carl didn't attempt to help his son and ordered Dylan to go inside their home as the agents of Maker's Project Oversight recaptured Eddie. Eddie came back and again tried to seek amends with his father, but Carl angrily told Eddie to leave them as he didn't consider Eddie as his son. Dylan thought that Eddie was his older brother and went to Eddie in order to get to know him, but when Eddie got "sick", Dylan sent Eddie to the hospital. However, Carl arrived and forced Dylan to get in the car. Carl was a businessman who lacked any form of emotion, until he met his love, Jamie. They soon married and decided to have a family, however, she died when giving birth to their son Eddie. This caused Carl to be cold and unloving towards his son, generally ignoring and only giving Eddie half-hearted complimations. Eddie tried everything to gain his father's affection, but it was never enough. Fillion was the 'face' of Complete Hero. The artist explained the choice of Fillion as follows: "I wanted to make a piece of work that looked at all kinds of heroism, not just the usual derring-do of white square-jawed men. But I thought it would be interesting to start with a white, square-jawed man and Nathan Fillion agreed to take part."
