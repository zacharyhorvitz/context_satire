 Fox News host Sean Hannity allegedly received help from the US Department for Housing and Urban Development to carry out multimillion dollar real estate deals, according to a report by The Guardian. The Guardian reported Sunday that Hannity is linked to a web of shell companies that spent at least $90 million buying more than 870 homes across seven states over the past 10 years. The newspaper said it reviewed thousands of pages of public records to piece together Hannity's alleged property portfolio. The Fox News host bought two apartment complexes in Georgia in 2014 for $22.7 million, according to The Guardian.  Fox News host Sean Hannity probably wouldn't like this guy Sean Hannity. On camera, Hannity rails against "elite" media types who have inappropriately cozy connections with the rich and powerful. Off camera, that's who Hannity is. A pair of stories in the past week have highlighted this on-air, off-air contradiction.  Moments before Sean Hannity's radio show started on Monday, an astonishing story broke: Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, revealed that Hannity was the third mystery client he had provided legal services to over the past year. The news jolted through the media industry, prompting reporters to send a flood of emails and texts to Hannity requesting comment. Hannity remarked that "everyone" was "going insane" and briefly teased journalists who had tuned into his radio program waiting for his reaction: "I'll just keep the media listening because they might learn something," he joked. Finally, the Fox News host, who is one of Trump's top defenders on cable news, addressed the elephant in the room, himself appearing a bit in the dark on what had just happened.
