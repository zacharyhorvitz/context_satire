On January 31, 2007, Michael Dell returned to the company as CEO. As chairman of the board, Michael Dell had  significant input into the company's operations during Rollins' years as CEO. However, with the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw immediate changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company. Michael Dell founded Dell Computer Corporation, dba PC's Unlimited,  in 1984 while a student at the University of Texas at Austin. Operating from Michael Dell's off-campus dormitory room at Dobie Center, the startup aimed to sell IBM PC-compatible computers built from stock components. Michael Dell started trading in the belief that by selling personal computer systems directly to customers, PC's Limited could better understand customers' needs and provide the most effective computing solutions to meet those needs. Michael Dell dropped out of college upon completion of his freshman year at the University of Texas at Austin in order to focus full-time on his fledgling business, after getting about $1,000 in expansion-capital from his family. In 1987, the company dropped the PC’s Limited dba to be Dell Computer Corporation and began expanding globally. The company name better reflected its presence in the business market, as well as resolved issues with the use of “Limited” in a company name in certain countries. The company set up its first international operations in Britain; eleven more followed within the next four years. In June 1988, Dell Computer's market capitalization grew by $30 million to $80 million from its June 22 initial public offering of 3.5 million shares at $8.50 a share.
