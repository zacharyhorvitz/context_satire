Allegations have surfaced of Sweden throwing the game against Slovakia so the Swedes would face Switzerland in the quarterfinals instead of Canada or the Czech Republic. Shortly before the game, Sweden coach Bengt-Åke Gustafsson was reported to have publicly contemplated tanking in order to avoid those teams, saying about Canada and the Czechs, "One is cholera, the other the plague." During the game itself, one reportedly suspect sequence came when Sweden had an extended five-on-three powerplay with five NHL stars on the ice—Peter Forsberg, Mats Sundin, Daniel Alfredsson, Nicklas Lidström and Fredrik Modin—and failed to put a shot on net. Sports Illustrated writer Michael Farber would say about this particular powerplay, "If the Swedes had passed the puck any more, their next opponent would have been the Washington Generals." In season two of Beyblade Burst, Valt Aoi, who hails from Japan was a top competitor in the Japanese Championship. In Season Two, Evolution, Valt is scouted for the prestigious Spanish team "BC Sol" and heads out to Spain. When he arrives in Spain, he runs into some old friends and meets some new ones who end up accompanying him along his journey. Valt’s first battle in Spain leaves his bey, Valtryek, with an opportunity to evolve, making it stronger. The story revolves around Valt Aoi and Shu Kurenai as well as his classmates at the Beigoma Academy school in Japan. When not studying, the close friends are obsessed with their Bey tops, creating a school bey club and challenging each other to battles at their Bey Stadium. The friends eventually become friendly rivals as they compete against each other in a professional competition to claim the title of Japan’s top Blader and to beat the undefeated Lui Shirosago/Lui Shirosagi.
