Abe visits his old friend, Asher Friedman, a playwright blacklisted for Communist Party connections. Abe writes an article about Asher's unfair treatment that is published in The New York Times which leads to his being offered a job as a theater critic for The Village Voice. As a young child, she lived in an Italianate/Mansard-style home in the Ashmont Hill section of Dorchester, Massachusetts and attended the local Girls' Latin School. The home later burned down, but a plaque at Welles Avenue and Harley Street proclaims "Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Square". The plaque was dedicated by her son, Senator Ted Kennedy, on her 102nd birthday in 1992. Joel and Midge's divorce is finalized before Midge leaves for Las Vegas. After a lackluster opening night, Midge adapts to performing on the road. Sophie's desire to play the lead in Strindberg's play, Miss Julie, leads Susie to secure producers, a Broadway theater, and a notable male co-star. Joel visits Midge in Las Vegas while Susie is in New York.
