 Historically, graffiti artists have not been shy in operating outside the realm of legality to get their work shown. In some cases, "tagging" a forbidden wall or other public space is even seen as a rite of passage. Our newest 'Next Lister,' Tristan Eaton, was no exception. In his early days as a tagger, Eaton took many risks to get his graffiti art up on prime urban real estate.  Jenny’s come a long way from her block in the Bronx -- maybe too long? Singer and actor Jennifer Lopez, who once told fans not to be “fooled by the rocks that I got,” found herself in the middle of a controversy recently: Can she still be Jenny from the block if she can't even come home to film an advertisement? After she sealed an endorsement deal with Italian carmaker Fiat, one of her commercials featured her in the Bronx, where she grew up. The commercial shows Lopez driving through streets lined with bodegas, beauty shops, bucket drummers and dancing children.  Our 'Next Lister' for this week is Tristan Eaton, a former troubled teen who is now one of New York City's most successful artists. A self-described “skateboarding punk,” Eaton was arrested as a youth for shoplifting and “tagging” city walls with graffiti. He says throughout these hard times, art was his saving grace. Many times, it got him off the hook with judges and school principals who were impressed with his artistic talents.
