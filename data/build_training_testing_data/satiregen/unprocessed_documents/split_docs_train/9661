 Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross apologized Thursday to two black men who were arrested while waiting for a business meeting at Starbucks, saying he made the situation worse by initially defending his officers' actions. Ross' apology came at a news conference on the same day the men -- Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson -- told ABC's "Good Morning America" they were handcuffed within minutes of arriving at the store April 12 for a business meeting. Ross said he was not aware that Starbucks allows people to sit in stores without making a purchase. "I can appreciate, in light of the Starbucks policy and how well known it is to many, why these two men were appalled when asked to leave and for this reason, me, I apologize to them," Ross told reporters.  Starbucks says it will close its 8,000 company-owned stores in the United States for one afternoon to educate employees about racial bias. The announcement follows an uproar over the arrest of two black men who were waiting for a friend at a Philadelphia Starbucks last week. The store manager called the police. The racial bias training will be provided on May 29 to about 175,000 workers.  Outrage over the arrests of two black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks wounded the reputation of one of the most progressive companies in America. Now Starbucks has a bold plan to make things right: It will close 8,000 stores for one afternoon in May to teach employees about racial bias. Communications experts praised it as a blueprint for how companies can handle public firestorms.
