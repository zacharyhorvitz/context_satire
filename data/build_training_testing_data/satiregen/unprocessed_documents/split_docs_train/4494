On June 5, 2018, police were called to the Parkland, Florida home of Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor and gun-control activist David Hogg. The caller claimed that there was a "hostage situation," prompting an emergency response that included a SWAT team. Hogg was not at home at the time, as he was in Washington, D.C., with his family to receive the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award as one of the organizers of the March for Our Lives. As had been made clear several times before and during the trial, Lamb's court victory did not make him a free man. He was escorted by police back to Penetanguishene and placed in the hospital's maximum security unit at Oak Ridge, where he was to remain indefinitely pending an order from the Ontario Executive Council. Seventeen days after his release from jail in June 1966, Lamb took a shotgun from his uncle's house and went on a shooting spree around his East Windsor neighbourhood, killing two strangers and wounding two others. He was charged with capital murder, which under the era's Criminal Code called for a mandatory death penalty, but he avoided this fate when the court found, in January 1967, that he had not been sane at the time of the incident. He was committed for an indefinite time in a psychiatric unit. Over the course of six years in care at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre's Oak Ridge facility he displayed a profound recovery, prompting an independent five-man committee to recommend to the Executive Council of Ontario that he be released, saying that he was no longer a danger to society.
