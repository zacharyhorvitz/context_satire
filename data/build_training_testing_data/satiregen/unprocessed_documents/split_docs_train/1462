On September 13, 2018, during the 20th season, Julie Chen closed out the show, saying, "From outside the Big Brother house...I'm Julie Chen Moonves, good night." It was the first time in her entire television career that she used her married name. It is believed that she was standing in solidarity with her husband, Les Moonves, who had just been ousted as President of CBS the week before over sexual misconduct allegations. While Chen was initially confirmed to return to the ninth season of her other CBS show The Talk, she was absent from the season premiere that aired on September 10, 2018. Chen issued a statement where she was taking a few days off, but would continue with Big Brother. Chen's first television appearance since Moonves' departure was the live eviction on September 13, 2018, where she closed out the episode with "From outside the Big Brother house...I'm Julie Chen Moonves, good night." The new sign-off broke with an established pattern that Chen has used in the past on Big Brother and showcased her support for her husband, while it received a mixed response from fans and viewers on Twitter. In September 2018, following allegations of sexual assault against him, it was reported that CBS was negotiating a $100-million exit package for Moonves and that CBS Chief Operating Officer Joe Ianniello would serve as his interim replacement. On September 9, 2018, CBS Corporation announced he had resigned and Joe Iannello would become interim CEO. Moonves and CBS will donate $20 million to the #MeToo movement, money that will be deducted from any severance benefits Moonves may be owed, the company said. The donation to charities promoting womenâ€™s equality in the workplace will come upon the conclusion of an independent investigation into the allegations, according to the statement.
