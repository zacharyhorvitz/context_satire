From the late 1950s, the Schwinn Bicycle Company made use of children's television programming to expand its dominance of the child and youth bicycle markets. The company was an early sponsor (from 1958) of Captain Kangaroo. The Captain himself was enlisted to sell Schwinn-brand bicycles to the show's audience, typically six years old and under. At the end of each live Schwinn marketing promotion, Bob Keeshan would intone, "Schwinn bikes—the quality bikes—are best!" East Richmond Heights is an unincorporated and census-designated place (CDP) in western Contra Costa County, California, United States. Its population was 3,280 at the 2010 census. The community is locally referred to as Richmond View, especially in the context of real estate advertisements. The area also includes Tewksbury Heights, a subdivision created in 1909 and located within the East Richmond Heights CDP. Schwinn registered the trademark "Schwinn Cruiser"® with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in November 1979, at or near the end of the bike boom.
