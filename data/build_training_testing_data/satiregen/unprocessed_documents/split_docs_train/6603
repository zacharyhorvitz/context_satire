Wade was born the second of two children to JoLinda and Dwayne Wade Sr. in Chicago, Illinois, on January 17, 1982. A spelling mistake on his birth certificate listed his first name as "Dwyane", which his parents kept." JoLinda already had two children when she married Wade's father, and with him she had Dwyane and his older sister Tragil. The pair separated when Wade was four months old. When his parents divorced, JoLinda was given custody of the two children. JoLinda struggled with drug addiction, and she was in and out of prison. At eight years old, Tragil tricked her brother into thinking they were going to the movies, only to leave him to live with his father and stepmother. Wade visited his mother on occasion until his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois, after which Wade would not see her for two years. After Dennis's death, she was identified as bisexual by Hollywood historians. According to Dennis's biographer, Peter Shelley, Eric Roberts, upon being asked if Dennis was bisexual, spoke of her telling him about her many lesbian relationships and said that she "appreciated the beauty of women. But Sandy also liked and appreciated what a very, very young man could do to a woman, I suppose." This was published more than twenty years after her death.
