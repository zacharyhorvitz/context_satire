 US President Donald Trump's first State of the Union touched on a number of international issues, including North Korea and the battle to defeat ISIS, but he didn't offer any specifics and barely mentioned Russia or China. The President's decision to stay clear of comment on Russia was notable, coming just one day after the US Treasury Department released a list of Russian oligarchs and prominent political figures which infuriated the Kremlin. In his address, Trump referred to Russia and China as "rivals" who "challenge (US) interests, our economy, and our values." Direct reference to Pakistan, a key partner in the war on terror, which Trump recently said would be subject to a reduction in US aid, was also omitted from the speech.  President Donald Trump signed a new executive order Tuesday to keep open the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and opened the door to sending new prisoners there. The decision is a major reversal of his predecessor President Barack Obama's policy. During his Tuesday night State of the Union speech, Trump said he had just signed the order directing Secretary of Defense James Mattis to "re-examine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay." In his speech and order Trump raised the prospect of additional ISIS prisoners being sent to Guantánamo Bay. Guantánamo Bay (Spanish: Bahía de Guantánamo) is a bay located in Guantánamo Province at the southeastern end of Cuba. It is the largest harbor on the south side of the island and it is surrounded by steep hills which create an enclave that is cut off from its immediate hinterland. The United States assumed territorial control over the southern portion of Guantánamo Bay under the 1903 Lease agreement. The United States exercises jurisdiction and control over this territory, while recognizing that Cuba retains ultimate sovereignty.
