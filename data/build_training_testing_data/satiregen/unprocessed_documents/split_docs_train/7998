In a 1992 interview with Soap Opera Digest, Genie Francis revealed that she initially considered leaving the role of Laura behind in 1979. A then 17-year-old Francis longed for the chance finish to out her last year of high school and graduate with her friends. However, her agent convinced her to stick around and finally make some money off of playing such a popular character because she did not make much from her first contract. Francis agreed and re-signed with the series for another two years. In 1983, Francis reflected on her early years with the series in an interview with Soap Opera Digest. Francis said, "The first year was a tremendous learning process, but then I got hold of it and took it on my own." The actress said "I was very nervous at the beginning, but when I learned to relax, I got better." She further explained her inexperience. In February 1994, Francis announced that she was pregnant with her first child. The pregnancy was written into the series and Laura is revealed to be pregnant with her second child. Soap Opera Digest said "It's not often that an actress's pregnancy works as beautifully into her storyline" as Francis's did. Much like when Laura's early stories guided Francis through adolescence, Francis would learn about motherhood through her portrayal of Laura.
