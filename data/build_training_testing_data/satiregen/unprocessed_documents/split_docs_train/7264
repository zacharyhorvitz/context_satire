A limited amount of Dumas's work was published during his lifetime in several small magazines and journals in the 1960s. It was mainly through the efforts of Eugene B. Redmond, the executor of Dumas's literary estate, that various collections of his work have been published. Poetry for My People was first published in 1970 by Southern Illinois University Press, where Dumas worked before his death. Toni Morrison, then working as an editor at Random House, read Poetry for My People and used her influence to have Random House publish two collections of Dumas's published and unpublished writings in 1974, Play Ebony, Play Ivory, which was a reprint of Poetry for my People, and Ark of Bones. The Order of St. Dumas appears in the second season of Gotham. In this show, the Dumas family were one of the founders of Gotham City until Caleb Dumas had an affair with Celestine Wayne. After cutting off Caleb's hand with a knife, the Wayne Family forced the Dumas into exile where some of them took refuge with a religious extension of the family while others remained behind and their last names were changed to Galavan. Years later, Theo Galavan and his sister Tabitha began their family's plans for revenge on the Wayne Family by targeting Bruce Wayne. Ten years later, Liz receives a letter from Ted and visits him, taking a photograph given to her by a detective. She demands the truth, but Ted continues to deny having anything to do with the murders. She then shows Ted the photograph â€” a crime scene image of one of his decapitated victims. Ted finally admits that he sawed her head off by writing the word "hacksaw" on the dew-misted window of the visiting room with his fingers, before erasing it with his hand.
