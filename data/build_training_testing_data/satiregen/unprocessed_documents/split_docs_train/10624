Pope Benedict's main arena for pastoral activity was the Vatican itself, his Christmas and Easter homilies and Urbi et Orbi are delivered from St Peter's Basilica. The Vatican is also the only regular place where Benedict XVI traveled via motor without the protective bulletproof case common to most popemobiles. Despite the more secure setting, Pope Benedict was victim to security risks several times inside Vatican City. On Wednesday, 6 June 2007 during his General Audience a man leapt across a barrier, evaded guards and nearly mounted the Pope's vehicle, although he was stopped and Benedict seemed to be unaware of the event. In recent centuries, when a pope was judged to have died, it was reportedly traditional for the Cardinal Camerlengo to confirm the death ceremonially by gently tapping the pope's head thrice with a silver hammer, calling his birth name each time. This was not done on the deaths of popes John Paul I and John Paul II. The Cardinal Camerlengo retrieves the Ring of the Fisherman and cuts it in two in the presence of the Cardinals. The pope's seals are defaced, to keep them from ever being used again, and his personal apartment is sealed.  Australia's High Court has agreed to consider an appeal against Cardinal George Pell's conviction on five counts of child sex abuse. The decision handed down Wednesday in the Australian capital, Canberra, is the former Vatican treasurer's last chance to overturn his conviction and six-year sentence. The appeal is expected to be heard by a panel of Australia's most senior judges sometime after March next year. A former close adviser to Pope Francis, Pell was found guilty in a unanimous jury verdict last December of five charges of assaulting two 13-year-old choirboys in the mid-1990s.
