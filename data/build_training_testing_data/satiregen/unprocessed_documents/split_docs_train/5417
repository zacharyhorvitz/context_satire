 With a healthy lead in final polls the day before the Florida primary, Mitt Romney depicted chief rival Newt Gingrich on Monday as increasingly desperate in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Romney and Gingrich continued to clash over the negative turn in the campaign between the two front-runners, with Gingrich accusing Romney of dishonesty.

Nor did he make the traditional congratulatory phone call to Romney after it became clear he wouldn't be able to follow his win in South Carolina with another in Florida.
