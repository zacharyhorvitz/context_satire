Chapman was born in Eccles, near Salford in England and began his advanced studies at a technical institute, now the University of Salford, in 1902. In 1904 at age 16, Chapman entered the University of Manchester. He competed for a scholarship to the university offered by his home county, and was the last student selected. Chapman later reflected, "I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I'd hit one place lower." In October 2008 it was announced that compulsory redundancies were likely at the university, as part of a plan to save £12.5 million over three years. A notice by the university registrar said that Salford needed to invest £300 million in university estate and £40 million in moving the arts and media faculty to the "MediaCityUK" site at Salford Quays, where the BBC is to establish its northern headquarters. The notice went on to say that these additional costs came in the context of a number of pressures: salary bills that had "exceeded the university's expectations"; a "serious problem" with student retention; the "credit crunch"; and three "seriously underperforming" schools. Affected schools include the School of Nursing, Salford Business School and the School of Community Health Sciences and Social Care. During the Spring Semester of 2019, student protests over the film school's display of two The Birth of a Nation posters received national attention. The posters were part of a larger donation from Cecilia DeMille Presley, granddaughter of American filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, and had been displayed on the first floor of Marion Knott Studios since they were gifted to the school in 2007. During the 2018-2019 school year, Chapman's black student population became more vocal about their discomfort with the display of posters for a film that has been widely criticized for its racist tones, celebration of white supremacy, and use of blackface. The film also is often credited by scholars with reviving the Ku Klux Klan.
