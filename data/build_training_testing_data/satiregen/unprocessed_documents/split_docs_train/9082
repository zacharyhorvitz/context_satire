 When House Speaker Paul Ryan slams down the gavel to send a huge Republican tax bill to President Donald Trump on Wednesday, he will fulfill a lifetime's ambition of steering a generational economic reform into law. "This is a promise made, this is a promise kept," Ryan said Tuesday, after an initial House vote on a measure that he has been working towards since signing on as an aide to his mentor, conservative fiscal guru Jack Kemp, in 1993. Never mind that Ryan's Democratic critics have castigated him for repudiating a reputation as a policy wonk and years of warnings about the perils of bloating deficits and swelling government debt, by embracing a bill that does exactly that. Ryan is simply savoring the taste of victory.  After 11 months, Republicans have finally got their act together. The question, as President Donald Trump and GOP leaders celebrate their generational overhaul of the tax code, is how long it will last. In unseasonable sunshine on the White House South Portico on Wednesday, Trump and the GOP savored a moment of togetherness and triumph, at last validating their monopoly on Washington power. "We just got together and we would work very hard ... it was a lot of fun.  We offer here the very different reactions we've seen from House Speaker Paul Ryan in his future over the last few days. The signals are decidedly mixed from Ryan, triumphant over his first big legislative victory as speaker and arguably the biggest Republican policy victory in a generation. On the one hand, his camp forcefully rejected the notion that he would leave his powerful role as Speaker. But then during a television victory lap, Ryan wouldn't say if he's running for reelection.
