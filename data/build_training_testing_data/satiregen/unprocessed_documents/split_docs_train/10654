 It is official. He's with Her. On Monday night, Bernie Sanders finally did what all runners-up for a presidential nomination are tasked with doing. It is not easy and it certainly is humbling (ask Hillary Clinton, circa 2008).  Traditionally, the spouses of major-party nominees get a speaking slot at the national convention to humanize the candidate. Former presidents speak to remind the faithful of their history. Bill Clinton falls into both categories, but he had a far more difficult task in closing out the second night of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia on Tuesday night; he needed to find a way to knit the party back together again. That's a tall order, and not just because the evening started with a walkout involving hundreds of Bernie Sanders delegates, according to one estimate.  Bernie Sanders says the release of Democratic National Committee emails that show its staffers working against him underscore the position he's held for months: Party Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz needs to go. "I don't think she is qualified to be the chair of the DNC not only for these awful emails, which revealed the prejudice of the DNC, but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people and young people, and I don't think her leadership style is doing that," Sanders told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday on "State of the Union," on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. As a result of the leaks, Wasserman Schultz has been removed as a speaker at the DNC this week, a decision reached by party officials Saturday, a top Democrat said. She is expected to gavel the convention in and out but that's it.
