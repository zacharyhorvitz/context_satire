Johnson started rapping at the age of 12, after his older brother introduced him to hip-hop. In high school, he and his brother put together a rap group that consisted of four artists who went by the name of Black Out Boiz aka B.O.B., where his original stage name ATL came from. Though the group had been receiving positive feedback, ATL would eventually leave B.O.B. (Black Out Boiz) & get started in his pursuit of a solo career. Travis Porter consists of Lakeem "Ali" Grant, Donquez "Quez" Woods and Harold "Strap" Duncan. During the early years, they started out as a group called The Hard Hitters, but later changed their name to Travis Porter to increase marketability. With their new name, the group toured across the United States before expanding their shows internationally. In 2008, the trio played in between cities, states, and even countries, including Kaiserslautern, Bamberg and Germany. After Travis Porter heard a song Roscoe had recorded called "All the Way Turnt Up", the group automatically wanted to be a part of it. Since Travis Porter was already an established local group, he handed the song over to them and was featured on the track. It was featured on Porter’s next mixtape, I’m a Differenter 2. The hit became very popular, but most people labeled the song as being Porter's.
