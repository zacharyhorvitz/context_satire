 Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette and the Flint water investigation team are expected to announce the first criminal charges Wednesday in the tainted water case, according to a source briefed on the investigation. Schuette and other officials had said that they will make a "significant announcement"  regarding their investigation into the Flint water crisis. A statement provided no other details on what they would say. In January, Schuette said he was appointing an ex-prosecutor and Detroit's former FBI chief to join the investigation into Flint's water crisis, creating a "conflict wall" between the state's inquiry and lawsuits targeting the state.  An administrative complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency alleges negligence and demands more than $220 million in damages for its role in the Flint, Michigan, water crisis. The discovery of high levels of lead in Flint's tap water has unleashed a floodgate of lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved residents in the two years since officials switched the city water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River to save money. The highly polluted river corroded old pipes and leached lead into tap water, according to experts. Filed on the second anniversary of the water switch, Monday's notice of class action administrative complaint was brought on behalf of hundreds of residents under the Federal Tort Claims Act.  Criminal charges against three men in Michigan on Wednesday marked a milestone in a crisis that's been years in the making, potentially harmed tens of thousands of people and cast a harsh spotlight on infrastructure issues across the country. Mike Glasgow, Stephen Busch and Mike Prysby could face years of prison time if they're convicted. They're the first government employees to face charges tied to the Flint water crisis. But they shouldn't be the last, according to residents of the city who had water contaminated with lead pumped into their homes.
