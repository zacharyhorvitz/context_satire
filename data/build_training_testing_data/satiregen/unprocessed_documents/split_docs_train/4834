At school, Erin intercepts a racist drawing by one of her Latino students and utilizes it to teach the class about the Holocaust, which everyone, except Caucasian student Ben Samuels (Hunter Parrish), has no knowledge of. She gradually begins to earn their trust and buys composition books for them to use as diaries, in which they talk about their experiences of being abused, seeing their friends die, and being evicted. Determined to reform her students, Erin takes on two part-time jobs to pay for more books and activities, and spends a lot more time at school, much to the disappointment of her husband (Patrick Dempsey). A transformation is specifically visible in one student, Marcus (Jason Finn). In 1992, the Middle School was opened, serving male and female day students in Grades 6 to 8. In 1999, boys were accepted as day students into the Upper School. In 2007, Stuart Hall School merged with Hunter McGuire School in Verona, VA and again became a K-12 independent school. A prekindergarten class was added in 2008. During the American Civil War, the school's building was used to house the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind while the latter's building was being used as a hospital. Students then attended classes in a nearby home in Staunton.
