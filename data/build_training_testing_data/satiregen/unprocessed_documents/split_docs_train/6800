Visa made a statement on January 12, 2018 that the signature requirement would become optional for all EMV contact or contactless chip-enabled merchants in North America starting in April 2018. It was noted that the signatures are no longer necessary to fight fraud and the fraud capabilities have advanced allowing this elimination leading to a faster in-store purchase experience. Visa was the last of the major credit card issuers to relax the signature requirements. The first to eliminate the signature was MasterCard Inc. followed by Discover Financial Services and American Express Co. Though officially listed as Chairman/CEO by the team, Dolan is sometimes referred to as an owner of the Indians, as the team is considered to be a family asset due to being purchased through various Dolan Family trusts. Dolan also has a partial ownership stake in the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball alongside his father/principal owner Larry, and older brother/Chairman & CEO Paul. Prior to his election victory in 2016, Matt was part of the team's front office, overseeing the budget and also running the team's charity program.
