Vatican City ( (listen)), officially Vatican City State (Italian: Stato della Citt√† del Vaticano; Latin: Status Civitatis Vaticanae), is an independent city-state enclaved within Rome, Italy. Established with the Lateran Treaty (1929), it is distinct from, yet under "full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction" of the Holy See (Latin: Sancta Sedes). With an area of 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of about 1,000, it is the smallest sovereign state in the world by both area and population.The Vatican City is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state (a type of theocracy) ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church. The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins.  Shortly after Pope Francis called Donald Trump's plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border "not Christian," the GOP front-runner's campaign was ready with a response:  Isn't Vatican City, the Catholic Church's 110-acre sovereign state, surrounded by walls? "Amazing comments from the Pope -- considering Vatican City is 100% surrounded by massive walls," tweeted  Dan Scavino, the Trump campaign's director of social media and a senior adviser. That's not quite true, though, said several Catholics familiar with the layout at Vatican City. Yes, the Vatican does have walls, and some are quite large.  For much of his five-day trip in Mexico, Pope Francis played the role of friendly pastor, smiling for selfies, kissing babies and encouraging the youth not to fall prey to the drug trade. On Wednesday, Francis unleashed another aspect of his complex public persona: The disappointed prophet who excoriates world powers for mistreating the poor and marginalized. Celebrating Mass in Ciudad Juarez, a city just across the border from the United States, Francis delivered a stinging critique of leaders on both sides of the fence, calling the "forced migration" of thousands of Central Americans a "human tragedy" and "humanitarian crisis." "Being faced with so many legal vacuums," the Pope said during his homily before a congregation of more than 200,000 people, "they get caught up in a web that ensnares and always destroys the poorest."
