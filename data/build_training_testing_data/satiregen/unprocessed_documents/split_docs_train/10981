When Bill and Dean brought this song to me, I instantly felt connected to its message of shining a little light into the lives of people who need it most", said Warwick. "I admire the work of Starlight Children's Foundation and know that if the song brings hope to even just one sick child, we have succeeded. In 1985, Warwick recorded the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR) benefit single "That's What Friends Are For" alongside Gladys Knight, Elton John and Stevie Wonder. The single, credited to "Dionne and Friends", was released in October and eventually raised over three million dollars for that cause. The tune was a triple #1 — R&B, Adult Contemporary, and four weeks at the summit on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1986 — selling close to two million 45s in the United States alone. "Working against AIDS, especially after years of raising money for work on many blood-related diseases such as sickle-cell anemia, seemed the right thing to do. In 2007, after being honored by U.S. Navy SEALs, Wane and her husband created a poster that featured her wearing authentic Navy Seal combat gear. Autographed copies of the poster were sold with the proceeds going to the Disabled American Veterans foundation (DAV). The combat gear was auctioned off as well for an additional donation. Wane stated in 2008, "I support a lot of charities, and DAV is very close to my heart."
