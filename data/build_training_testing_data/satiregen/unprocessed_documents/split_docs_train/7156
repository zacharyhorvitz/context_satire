 Sean Spicer isn't taking your questions. For two days in a row, since returning from President Trump's trip abroad, the White House press secretary has held uncharacteristically short press briefings in which he claimed not to know the answer to questions, outsourced questions to other officials or dismissed the premise of questions entirely. Both briefings included less than 20 minutes for questions -- far less than most prior briefings -- and ended with Spicer abruptly exiting the room to the consternation of reporters. At Wednesday's briefing, which was off-camera, one reporter could be heard shouting after the departing press secretary, "How short are these gonna be!?"  President Donald Trump isn't speaking much to the media these days, but his ability to drive any given news cycle remains nearly unparalleled. The pattern played out once again this week, with the president's return to the country marked by few engagements with the press but ample hype on social media. Trump completed his nine-day, five-country trip abroad last month without taking a single question from reporters. His last press conference came during a joint appearance on May 18 with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos that featured a brief Q&A session. On July 21, 2017, Spicer announced his intention to resign as White House Press Secretary. He made his decision known immediately after President Trump appointed financier Anthony Scaramucci as White House communications director. In the weeks leading up to the resignation announcement, Spicer had sought "a more strategic communications role" in the White House. Trump had reportedly been dissatisfied for some time with Spicer's performance as White House Press Secretary.
