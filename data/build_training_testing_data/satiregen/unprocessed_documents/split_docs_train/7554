 A "smoking object" was thrown over the White House fence late Tuesday, and authorities have closed the north gate of the residence while the object is investigated, U.S. Secret Service spokesman George Ogilvie said. The president and his wife were not at home; they were celebrating the first lady's birthday at a restaurant a few blocks away. The unidentified object was thrown during a protest, Ogilvie said. Occupy protesters in Washington rallied at the White House, on Capitol Hill and at the Supreme Court on Tuesday, railing against corporate control at the nation's most powerful political institutions. At some time during the first two months of each session, the president customarily delivers the State of the Union address, a speech in which an assessment is made of the state of the country, and the president's legislative agenda is outlined. The speech is modeled on the Speech from the Throne, given by the British monarch. There is a major difference, in that the president is the principal author of his own State of the Union address, while the Speech from the Throne is customarily written by the prime minister. As a geographic feature, Capitol Hill rises near the center of the District of Columbia and extends eastward. Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, as he began to develop his plan for the new federal capital city in 1791, chose to locate the "Congress House" (the Capitol building) on the crest of the hill at a site that he characterized as a "pedestal waiting for a monument". The Capitol building has been the home of the Congress of the United States and the workplace of many residents of the Capitol Hill neighborhood since 1800.
