The Los Angeles Police Department is world-renowned for its training. Officers on the Department receive the best academic, tactical and physical conditioning in the field. However, as with almost any profession, there are still some hazards associated with the job. On February 7, 2008, when LAPD responded to a call that an emotionally disturbed man killed three of his family members, the man shot two SWAT officers, one of whom was killed. At least six attempts have been made to merge the Los Angeles Airport Police into the Los Angeles Police Department since the early 1970s. A number of outside studies have been commissioned resulting in recommendations that the forces not be merged. The latest study was in 2004 â€“ 2005 and contained almost identical recommendations as put forth in a 1984 study. In 1999, a new City Charter clause stipulated that the Airport Police would be under the autonomous control of Los Angeles World Airports. The Los Angeles Police Department was formed in 1869, and has since become the third-largest law enforcement agency in the United States. They have been involved in various events in history, such as the Black Dahlia murder case, and the infamous Rampart scandal.
