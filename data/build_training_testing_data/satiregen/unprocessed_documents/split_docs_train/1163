The sixth series started on 9 January 2011 and ended on 27 March 2011 with the following 16 celebrities taking part. Although 16 celebrities are confirmed to take part, in a shocking twist, the first two episodes were qualifying rounds, in each of which eight couples skated and two were eliminated, so that only 12 couples reached the competition proper. For the first time, viewers in the Republic of Ireland were able to vote via the TV3 Ireland website. Christopher Dean and Jayne Torvill returned to mentor the contestants, with Karen Barber moving from The Ice Panel to the role of head coach. On February 1, 1960, four black students sat down at a segregated lunch counter in a Greensboro, North Carolina, Woolworth's store.

In 1993, an eight-foot section of the lunch counter was moved to the Smithsonian Institution and the store site now contains a civil rights museum,which had its grand opening on Monday, February 1, 2010,the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the sit-ins.
