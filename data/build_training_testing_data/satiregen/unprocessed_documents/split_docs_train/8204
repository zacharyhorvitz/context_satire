Kaminsky was born in Argentina to a Jewish family from Russia. In 1932, when Kaminsky was seven years old, he moved with his family to Paris, where his father worked as a tailor. From Paris, the family moved in 1938 to Vire, Calvados, where his uncle was established. Adolfo worked in a dye shop and became fascinated by the chemistry of colourants. He used to say: "Keep awake. The longer possible. Struggle against sleep. The calculation is easy. In 1940, after the German invasion of France, the family house in Vire was taken by the Germans and Kaminsky temporarily lived in another house, in which Michel Drucker's father was also hosted. His mother was killed by the Nazis in 1941. Aged 17, Adolfo Kaminsky entered the Resistance. At first he watched the railway station at Vire from where railcars of the Todt Organization, loaded with material for the Atlantic Wall, transited.
