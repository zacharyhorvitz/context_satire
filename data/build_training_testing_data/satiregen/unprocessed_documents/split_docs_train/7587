In "Rassvet," Liz tracks down her grandfather Dominic Wilkinson with the help of Ressler and finally learns much of the truth about Reddington and her mother from him. Liz learns that the man she shot as a child, as remembered in "Tom Connolly," was in fact the real Reddington and she killed him. Dom tells Liz about her mother and her history with Ilya Koslov, the man who became Reddington to protect Katarina. Dom states that twenty-eight years before, her mother had promised to send him a letter to a post office box when she was safe, but he has never gotten one despite checking every week. At the end of "Ian Garvey: Conclusion", Garvey is shot several times by Liz and Dembe when he attempts to kill Red, leaving him severely wounded. Wanting to know what Garvey knows about the bones, Liz attempts to save his life and he is rushed to the hospital where the doctors announce they are losing his pulse. At the beginning of "Nicholas T. Moore", it's confirmed in a conversation between Red and Liz that Garvey died of his wounds. However, Liz is not happy as the answers he possessed died along with him. In "Ian Garvey: Conclusion", despite taking Garvey hostage and en route to collecting the skeletal remains of Katarina, Ian rams his sedan into another car, leaving Red and Dembe there as he escapes. Red later confronts Garvey after learning that the latter now knows that Liz is his daughter. Only then, Jennifer confronts Red for what he's done and the fact that Ian saved her and Naomi's life from their disappointment when they learned of his criminal career. Red then recognizes her from all the years.
