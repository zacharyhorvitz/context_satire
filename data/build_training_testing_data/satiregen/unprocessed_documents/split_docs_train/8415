As a writer and narrator, Attenborough continued to collaborate with the BBC Natural History Unit in the new millennium. Alastair Fothergill, a senior producer with whom Attenborough had worked on The Trials of Life and Life in the Freezer, was making The Blue Planet (2001), the Unit's first comprehensive series on marine life. He decided not to use an on-screen presenter due to difficulties in speaking to a camera through diving apparatus, but asked Attenborough to narrate the films. The same team reunited for Planet Earth (2006), the biggest nature documentary ever made for television and the first BBC wildlife series to be shot in high definition.  The burgeoning wave of nature documentaries increasingly contains a concerted environmental message: If you enjoy watching these remarkable animals in their native habitats, start thinking seriously about the planet and what humanity is doing to it. That theme comes across most overtly in "Our Planet," a Netflix series hosted by the great patriarch of the genre, Sir David Attenborough. Produced in conjunction with World Wildlife Fund, the series pushes viewers toward a website "to discover what we need to do now to protect our jungles." at a moment when it has "never been more urgent and important to recognize the fragility of our world." Prompted by an enthusiastic ornithologist at the BBC Natural History Unit, Attenborough then turned his attention to the animal kingdom and in particular, birds. As he was neither an obsessive twitcher nor a bird expert, he decided he was better qualified to make The Life of Birds (1998) on the theme of behaviour. The documentary series won a second Peabody Award the following year. The order of the remaining "Life" series was dictated by developments in camera technology.
