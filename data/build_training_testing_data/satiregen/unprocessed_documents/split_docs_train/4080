Ben Daniels lives in south London with actor Ian Gelder. They met during a 1993 production of Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane. Daniels was already sure of his orientation in his teens (He once remarked: "Out? I've never been in.") After auditioning for the role of C-3PO, Daniels only became fully interested in it after seeing a concept design by Ralph McQuarrie. Daniels did not see the final costume until after donning it for the shoot and being shown a Polaroid photograph. He struggled with delivering the character's lines until Lucas informed him that they would redub the dialogue in post-production. Daniels also portrayed a protocol droid with a "white pointy face" in one shot in the original film. Daniels said in an interview in 2001: "Homophobia is still shockingly prevalent in film and TV. I know I've lost work because of being gay, and it is always an issue. Even on a serious BBC Two drama, there will be some suit in some office going, "Hmmm, isn't he a poof?" I don't consider myself politically gay, but whenever I catch a whiff of that now, I'm on it like a ton of bricks."
