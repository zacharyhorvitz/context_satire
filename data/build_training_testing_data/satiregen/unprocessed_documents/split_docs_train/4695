In March 2018, Dan Balan released a new single  called "Allegro Ventigo", featuring Matteo. Successful in the likes of Romania, Ukraine, Russia, and Bulgaria, there was much talk around the language the lyrics are written in. Balan joked in an interview that this is "Old Moldavian", but the settled view is that the lyrics are written in a fictional language that combines elements of Spanish, Italian, Greek and Romanian. On September 12 2018, Dan Balan released a new single called "Numa Numa 2" in association with Marley Waters. Lin has been in a relationship with Xie Xingfang, herself a former world champion, since 2003. They were quietly engaged on December 13, 2010 in Haizhu, Guangzhou. Xie initially denied but later acknowledged romantic involvement with Lin, who reacted angrily at the public exposure of their relationship, citing reasons of personal privacy. The two were married on September 23, 2012 and the wedding ceremony was held at the Beijing University of Technology. He released his second Russian single, "Lish do Utra," on September 26, 2011. The song was recorded in studios in several countries, including Romania, the U.K., Russia and the U.S. In an interview, Balan explained that upon thinking the concept of the song, he had an immediate notion that the song would be best presented in the Russian language. The single reached number one position on the Russian digital sales chart.
