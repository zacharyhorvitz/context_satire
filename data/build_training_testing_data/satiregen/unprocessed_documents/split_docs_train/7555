 The sudden resignation of CIA chief David Petraeus over the revelation of an extramarital affair means that he will not be testifying before Congress this Thursday on the deaths of four Americans at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. On Starting Point this morning, Rep. Jason Chaffetz insists thatÂ Petraeus should still testify, saying that he doesn't want to "let a salacious story distract from the fact that the General should put his duty and his honor front and foremost." Chaffetz also responds to the latest reports about Gen. John Allen's involvement in the scandal and weighs in on the timeline of the FBI's revelations. "I want to make sure the president is fully engaged," Rep. Chaffetz says. The Petraeus scandal is a series of events that garnered strong media attention when an extramarital affair between retired four-star general David Petraeus, then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),  and Paula Broadwell became public information. Petraeus had chosen Broadwell to be his official biographer. She co-authored All In: The Education of General David Petraeus, his biography, when Petraeus was the International Security Assistance Force commander. On November 9, 2012, she was reported to have been involved in the extramarital affair with Petraeus that triggered his resignation as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency when it was discovered by the FBI.  About four years ago, Paula Broadwell began her Ph.D. dissertation on Gen. David Petraeus' innovative leadership skills. Some of the interviews were done via e-mail. Others were conducted as Broadwell occasionally ran with the physically fit four-star, including one time with Petraeus and his team along the Potomac River in Washington. Broadwell decided to turn that research into a book and go to Afghanistan after Petraeus was tapped in June 2010 to replace Gen. Stanley McChrystal as the top commander in the country.
