 Three titans of industry want to fix health care. The question is, how should they go about doing it? On Monday, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon announced that their three companies -- Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase -- would create a new company to develop a better health care solution for their U.S. employees. Details of the plan are sparse.  Jamie Dimon isn't planning on going anywhere. The JPMorgan Chase boss revealed Monday that he'll stay at the helm of America's largest bank for about five more years. He said he and the board agreed on the time frame. Dimon, already Wall Street's longest-serving CEO, is credited with steering JPMorgan through the financial crisis.  First books. Then groceries. Now health care? Amazon shook up the health care world on Tuesday, announcing it was partnering with fellow heavy hitters Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to address soaring costs.
