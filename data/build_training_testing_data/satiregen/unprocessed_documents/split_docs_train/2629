As the Trump presidency unfolded, numerous prominent conservative Republicans expressed similar concerns that Trump's perceived disregard for the rule of law betrayed conservative principles. The Times reported in November 2018 that more than a dozen members of the conservative-libertarian Federalist Society—which had been instrumental in selecting Trump's appointments to federal courts—"are urging their fellow conservatives to speak up about what they say are the Trump administration's betrayals of bedrock legal norms".  Donald Trump on Sunday warned his supporters in this border state that Hillary Clinton "wants to let people just pour in," saying without evidence that hundreds of millions of people could enter the US under a Clinton presidency. And speaking just nine days before Election Day, the Republican nominee also bemoaned criticism of waterboarding and appeared to once again call for bringing back the since-banned technique for use in the fight against ISIS. "These savages are chopping off heads, drowning people. This is medieval times and then we can't do waterboarding? In the weeks before the election, Trump urged his supporters to volunteer as poll watchers on Election Day, saying they were needed to guard against "voter fraud" and a "rigged" outcome. The rhetoric was seen as a call to intimidate minority voters or challenge their credentials to prevent them from voting.
