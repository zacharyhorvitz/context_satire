Pepperidge Farm products include Goldfish crackers, varieties of bread, and several lines of cookies. Their cookies are separated into two lines, the Distinctive line and the Old Fashioned line. Each type of cookie from the "Distinctive" line is named for a European city such as the Milano cookie or the Brussels cookie. The Distinctives cannot be readily replicated by home bakers. The Campbell Soup Company, also known as just Campbell's, is an American processed food and snack company. As the name implies, the company is most closely associated with its flagship canned soup products, however it has through mergers and acquisitions grown to become one of the largest processed food companies in the U.S., with a wide variety of products under its flagship Campbell's brand as well as such well-known brands as Pepperidge Farm, Snyder's of Hanover, V8, and Swanson. Under these brands and many others, Campbell's produces not only soups and broths, but other canned meals such as SpaghettiOs, baked goods such as cookies and crackers, beverages, and salty snacks such as pretzels and potato chips. It is headquartered in Camden, New Jersey. The company announced in January 2018 that their only Canadian factory, in Toronto, would close. Production would shift to three existing facilities within the U.S. It was reported that the expected loss of jobs, as a result of the closing, would be 380.
