On November 8, 2008, a Dallas 30th anniversary reunion was held at Southfork Ranch in Parker, Texas, reuniting original cast members Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, Ken Kercheval, Steve Kanaly and Charlene Tilton; other cast members in attendance were Susan Howard, Audrey Landers, Mary Crosby and Sheree J. Wilson. The front and back lawn of the fictional Ewing family home played host to a massive barbecue filled with people from the Dallas area, across the U.S. and around the world (who paid as much as $1,000) to reminisce and celebrate the series, as well as meeting with cast members. During the festivities, Kercheval said he was shocked to see the continued support for the show 17 years after it last aired: "I don't understand it. The staying power. The new series is a continuation of the old series, with the story continuing after a 20-year break. It does not take the events of the 1990s TV movies Dallas: J.R. Returns or Dallas: War of the Ewings as canon. Instead we find the characters 20 years after the events of the Season 14 cliffhanger. In an interview with UltimateDallas.com, writer/producer Cynthia Cidre was asked to describe the new Dallas. Kristin visited Southfork with her mother upon learning that Sue Ellen was pregnant with her first child, and were warmly welcomed by the Ewing family. Kristin returned later, now studying architecture at university and in need of a job to make ends meet. J.R. took her on as a secretary, having just lost latest secretary Louella Caraway Lee (Meg Gallagher) to her honeymoon, and also got her a condo to live in. In time, the two began an affair, and J.R. used Kristin to find out valuable insider information by getting her to seduce potential business partners.
