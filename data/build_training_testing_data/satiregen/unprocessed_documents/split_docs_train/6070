Just three weeks later, Fitzsimmons announced that Bold Ruler was being retired because of an ankle injury. "He may have injured the ankle in the Brooklyn, or in training," he said. "I know that something happened to him, but I don't know when it happened or exactly what he's got." Although a return to racing later in the year might have been possible, Fitzsimmons felt Bold Ruler was too valuable to risk. The official premise of the show was: "After saving the universe, Steven is still at it, tying up every loose end. But as he runs out of other people’s problems to solve, he’ll finally have to face his own." Patekar went through a tough childhood. He married Neelkanti at the age of 27. He is an atheist but continues to celebrate the Ganesh festival due to tradition. His father died of a heart attack when Nana Patekar was 28 and later Patekar also lost his first son.
