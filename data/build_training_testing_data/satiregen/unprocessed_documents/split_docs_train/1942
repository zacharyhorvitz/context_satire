The Department of Transportation (DOT) is the most common name for a government agency in Canada or the United States devoted to transportation. The largest is the United States Department of Transportation, which oversees interstate travel and is a federal agency. All U.S. states, Canadian provinces, and many local agencies also have similar organizations and provide enforcement through DOT officers within their respective jurisdictions. The DOT's mission statement claims that an "efficient and modern transportation system " to "improve the quality of life for all Americans" is their goal.  A new permanent span over Washington state's Skagit River reopened Sunday, some four months after a bridge collapse on Interstate 5. The bridge's failure in late May sent cars tumbling into the river and severed the state's main artery to Canada, on which trucks carry an estimated $13.9 billion annually in cargo. A temporary span went up within a few weeks. NTSB: 'Boom,' then shudder, first sign of problem on bridge Roughly 70,000 vehicles a day travel on Interstate 5 over the bridge, said the state Department of Transportation, which announced the reopening on its Facebook page. The State Road Department, predecessor of today's Department of Transportation, was authorized in 1915 by the Florida legislature. For the first two years of its existence, the department acted as an advisory body to the 52 counties in the state, helping to assemble maps and other information on roads.
