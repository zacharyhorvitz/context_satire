The fictional St. Donovan's High School was inspired by the Catholic high schools of writers Tim Calpin and Kevin Jakubowski. Calpin attended Scranton Preparatory School in Scranton, Pennsylvania, while Jakubowski attended Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois. The look of the school and style of dress were drawn from these high schools. The school mascot (Friar) and the school emblem (cross of the Dominican Order) was derived from Fenwick. Between 1880 and 1915, more than 50 high school secret societies were formed within Chicago. Hyde Park Academy, alone, had 18 groups, and battles with secret societies within the village of Oak Park, Illinois, were taken to the Appellate courts. By 1929, Oak Park had one of Illinois's top-ranking preparatory schools within its village, Fenwick High School, and the village ruled in favor of each school within Oak Park to individually oversee all of their students' secret societies, rather than implement a general regulatory system across the board. Bishop Fenwick High School was founded in 1959 by the late Richard Cardinal Cushing and was named for the second Bishop of Boston, Benedict Joseph Fenwick, S.J. The school was the first coeducational Catholic high school on Boston's North Shore and was staffed by the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur. In 2003, the Archdiocese of Boston relinquished control of its "Central High Schools", including Fenwick, in response to financial difficulties. The Archdiocese still owns the property and is involved in school governance, making appointments to the board of trustees; for that reason it is not considered truly independent.
