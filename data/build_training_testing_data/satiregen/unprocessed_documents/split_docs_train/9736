 A reshaped Republican presidential race shifted to New Hampshire on Wednesday as Mitt Romney won the endorsement of an old rival and Michele Bachmann dropped out after a disappointing Iowa showing. Sen. John McCain, the New Hampshire primary winner in 2000 and 2008, told supporters of Romney,  that their votes "will catapult him on to victory in a very short period of time." "Mitt Romney and I and you believe that America's greatest days are still ahead of us," said the Arizona senator, who beat Romney for the 2008 GOP presidential nomination. "It  just requires the kind of leadership to put us back in the position that made America the greatest and noblest experiment in the history of the world -- and the person who will do that is right here with you today."  Hours before the first primary vote of 2012, Republican front-runner Mitt Romney tried to recover from a potential stumble Monday as his presidential rivals intensified their attacks against him. Voters in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary begin choosing their GOP candidates as early as 12 a.m. Tuesday in two small towns -- Dixville Notch and Hart's Location -- while polling stations in the rest of the state open at 6 a.m. and close as late as 8 p.m. ET. The final day of campaigning saw Romney under fire for a comment about health insurance that quickly became fodder for criticism.  As people head to the polls in New Hampshire, the campaigns will learn whether all the funds used for direct marketing to voters was money well-spent. Mailings, robocalls, phone surveys, doorknob hangers, mass e-mails, texts -- it's next to impossible to find a registered Republican or independent voter in the Granite State who hasn't received several of each. A group of voters in the Manchester area told CNN some left an impression but most wound up in the trash or had no impact on their decision. While every candidate sent out something to voters, the group said one politician in particular went beyond the others.
