In June 2008, the University of Michigan Press ended its relationship with Pluto Press. McCraken stated in an interview with Inside Higher Ed that the relationship ended because Pluto Press does not use the same peer review process as The University of Michigan. She also stated in response to a question that postulated a link with criticism of Overcoming Zionism that "the initial decision of the executive board of the press was that it would not make a decision based on a particular book" and that "certainly the free and open exchange of ideas is the foundation of everything we do at the university." Roger van Zwanenberg, chairman of Pluto Press responded to the decision by linking it to the criticism of Overcoming Zionism. The thought of establishing a part of the University of Michigan in the city of Flint started in the year 1837 when Sarah Miles wrote a letter to her family stating, "A branch of the Michigan University at Ann Arbor is to be established in Flint at some future day." In May 1944 the Flint Board of Education requested that the University of Michigan open a satellite campus in Flint. In June 1944, Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the G.I. Bill into law. The University of Michigan was involved with the building of the Philippine education system during the era of the American colonization of the Philippines. Early on, colonial government officials highlighted the importance of increasing the number of teachers and primary schools in the country. President McKinley appointed teachers from various universities, tasking them with building the foundations of the Philippine education system under American control. The first wave of these men sailed from San Francisco to Manila on the Thomas, also  known as the “Thomasites.” Of the nearly 500 who came to the Philippines in this group, the delegation from the University of Michigan was the second largest group of teachers who arrived.
