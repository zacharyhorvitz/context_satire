In a conversation conducted via email as part of the trio's #INTERVIEW piece the following November, LaBeouf said that he was "heartbroken" and "genuinely remorseful and full of shame and guilt" at the start of #IAMSORRY, but that "in the end I felt cared for however it came—it was beautiful, it blew me away." He revealed, however, that one woman had proceeded to sexually assault him during the February performance, while Rönkkö and Turner later clarified that they had prevented the assault by intervening as soon as they were aware of the incident starting to occur. In November 2015, the trio invited the public to join LaBeouf in person at New York's Angelika Film Center as he watched all his movies consecutively, in reverse chronological order, over the course of three days. At the same time, a camera focused on LaBeouf's face was live streamed online throughout the performance. Rolling Stone's David Ehrlich called the piece "a work of genius," and noted that "sitting a few feet behind  and watching him stare up at his own gargantuan reflection, his method finally began to make sense of his madness." Tasha Robinson of The Verge noted that "over the course of three days, the initial bafflement was largely replaced with enthusiasm," with the appeal of the work being the "sense of voyeurism, that ability to see people in a vulnerable state," adding that "no matter how abnormal the installation itself was, the normalcy of his presence, largely unchanging from hour to hour, was lulling." Zak, a 22-year-old with Down syndrome, lives in a retirement home in North Carolina where he is cared for by Eleanor. He dreams of becoming a professional wrestler and attending the wrestling school of his hero, the Salt Water Redneck, whose videos he watches obsessively. After a failed escape attempt, Zak sneaks out of the home late at night with the assistance of his elderly roommate, Carl. He stows away on a small fishing boat for the night.
