"Ultralight Beam" was released on February 14, 2016, as the first track on West's seventh studio album The Life of Pablo. The day before, West performed the song on Saturday Night Live with Chance the Rapper, Kirk Franklin, The-Dream, Kelly Price and a gospel choir. The performance received positive reviews from critics, with many commenting on Chance the Rapper's verse. Matt Wilstein of The Daily Beast said that he "ended up stealing the show with his fire verse." The song has appeared on year-end lists of multiple publications. Pitchfork listed "Ultralight Beam" as the best song of 2016 on their ranking of the year's 100 best songs, writing: " is an exalted space, a promise of redemption and healing that felt more fragile and unlikely as the year wore on. It is a song of Godlike perspective from a man who spent most of the year appearing to have none." Similarly, Rolling Stone listed it as the fifth best song of 2016 on their list of the year's 50 best songs, writing " help  plant a foot on the devil's neck." The song, heavily influenced by soul and gospel music, is about West's faith in God. Its recording process, as described by producer Derek Watkins, took place over multiple jam sessions, where some of West's regular collaborators, including Mike Dean, were involved. Other individuals who participated included Watkins, producer Swizz Beatz and singer Justin Bieber, whose contributions were omitted from the final recording. In an interview, Watkins describes the "ultralight beam" as "the connection that goes straight to heaven."
