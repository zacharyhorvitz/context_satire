Illuminations was founded by Wally Arnold, who launched the first retail store in 1996. In 2006, the brand was acquired by Yankee Candle. Faced with recession pressures, Yankee shuttered the Illuminations  stores, and in 2009, the final Illuminations candles were sold. In 2019, one of Illumination's former customers, Mitch Davis, acquired rights to the Illuminations trademark and liaised with product expert Pamela Donnellan to re-launch the brand with "Illuminations Candles, Inc." as its new registered name. Yankee Candle's flagship store, which opened in 1982, is located in South Deerfield, Massachusetts. It features all available Yankee Candles as well as kitchen and home accessories, New England crafts, gifts and collectibles, a toy shop, picnic grounds and a "Bavarian Christmas Village" filled with decorated Christmas trees and a toy train that runs through to Santa's Workshop, where animated elves and an 'assembly line' for wooden vehicles surround Santa Claus's desk. Visitors can dip their own candles in a specially equipped area, make wax molds of their hands, or create their own unique candle. There is also a candle making museum and a Hillside Pizza cafe on site.
