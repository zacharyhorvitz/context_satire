 President Donald Trump is set to deliver his first address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night -- where he's expected to make the case for a budget that boosts defense spending and slashes funding for agencies. The speech -- a "State of the Union" address in all but the name -- will be Trump's biggest national audience since his swearing-in ceremony, a chance to try to bring the nation together and sell his agenda on Capitol Hill. Here's what to watch for Tuesday night:  Trump's tone Dark and dystopian has been this President's style. His Republican National Convention speech painted a picture of a struggling nation in need of rescue.  President Donald Trump is set to give an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday -- but it technically won't be his first State of the Union address. Trump isn't shaking up any traditions -- as he is known to do -- but instead following what past presidents have done before him. His speech will be known as an "address to a joint session." Traditionally, a president of the United States should be in office for a year before they give their first State of the Union address.  They're supposed to be pillars of unity and peace, where both Jews and non-Jews can enjoy classes, sports and other communal activities. But more than 80 Jewish community centers and schools have turned into targets of hate and been subjected to bomb threats as fears of heightened anti-Semitism spread across the country. The threats have reached such a crescendo that President Donald Trump used his speech to Congress on Tuesday night to address the issue. "Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms," the President said.
