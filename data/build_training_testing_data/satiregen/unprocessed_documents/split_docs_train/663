The Skyraider, meanwhile, had succumbed to stone-sickness, and was slowly dropping over the Edge. Rook and Cowlquape mourn the end of Twig, who had been struck by the crossbow-bolt of the chief guardian of night, Orbix Xaxis and had decided to go down with his ship. However, at the last minute, Twig's caterbird, who had sworn to watch over him for always, catches him and flies towards the rejuvenating waters of Riverrise. Whether they make it in time is left as a cliffhanger. They successfully fly the ship back to Undertown, and with the help of the Professor of Darkness deposit the stormphrax in the treasury, saving the city. Though Vilnix attempts to assert his authority with force, the academics quickly turn against him, and he flees to the hanging-baskets leading to Undertown, only to fall to his death when his basket is sabotaged on orders of the leagues, in revenge for stopping their supply of phraxdust. The story concludes with Twig getting a ship of his own, the "Edgedancer" and a new crew, financed by Mother Horsefeather in exchange for the secret of phraxdust production. However, as Twig sets off, he enacts a scheme arranged with the Professor of Darkness; the crew throw envelopes containing stormphrax shards and instructions of phraxdust production overboard, ensuring the secret is known by all. The novel begins by showing the state of play in Undertown. The usurper Vox Verlix is now trapped in the Palace of Statues having lost control over all his grand projects. The Guardians of Night took over the Tower of Night when they drove him out, the Shrykes seized the Great Mire Road, and the goblins Vox hired to enslave Undertowners and build the Sanctaphrax Forest cut the Most High Academe out of the loop. Vox was left as nothing more than a puppet used by General Tytugg of Undertown to keep the Shrykes at bay.
