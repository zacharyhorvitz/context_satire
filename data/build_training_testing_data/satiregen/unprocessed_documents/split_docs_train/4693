On October 24, 2019, Reinhart announced that she partnered with American Express for the relaunch of its AmexGreen Card. Also in October 2019, Reinhart became a spokesperson and ambassador for CoverGirl. Erika Woods, CoverGirl's vice president of marketing, stated "We're excited for Lili to join our family as she embodies a woman who is unapologetically herself â€“ she is authentic, talented, and truly lives by what she believes in." She has also appeared on a few game and reality shows. In 2004, she appeared in Celebrity Mole: Yucatan, in which she was the "mole", the rogue agent sabotaging the group. She was one of the "Gingers" on the second season of The Real Gilligan's Island (the other was Erika Eleniak), but left the show when she accidentally cut her finger severely enough to sever tendons and require surgery. Everhart was also a panelist on To Tell The Truth from 2000 until 2001 and on Hollywood Squares from 2002 until 2004. On October 8, 2019, it was announced that Reinhart will publish a book of poems called Swimming Lessons: Poems. Reinhart stated she decided she wanted to share her poetry with the world despite her fear of doing so and that her own experiences inspired the collection. The book explores young love and anxiety and depression in the face of fame. Swimming Lessons is scheduled to be released May 5, 2020.
