The first location was built in 1983 in Atlanta and was Marriott's first sister brand. The brand was always meant to target business travelers. However, over the years, it has come to cater to the leisure traveler, too. Most now have a swimming pool or fitness center, microwaves and mini-fridges for rent, and family rates. On August 5, 2003, the JW Marriott Jakarta was the site of a massive terrorist car bombing. The bomb exploded in a car in the hotel's entrance directly off the lobby, destroying the entryway, sending marble panels off the lobby walls (along with the near-annihilation of the lobby), and knocking off a large amount of glass panes on the exterior. Several guests inside their hotel rooms mentioned that the force of the blast knocked them over as a result of the entire building shaking. One guest also said that his window imploded into his bedroom and the force of the blast sent him flying from one end of his room to the other. In 2007, Marriott started its Refreshing Business Initiative to renovate the Courtyard properties to better target business travelers based on consumers needs. Renovations included a redesigned lobby, a bar with longer service hours allowing guests to be more social, and an increased revenue.
