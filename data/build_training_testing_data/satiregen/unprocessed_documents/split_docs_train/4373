Across the street from the University of Minnesota Medical Center Fairview is an area known as the "Superblock," a four-city-block space comprising four residence halls (Pioneer, Frontier, Centennial and Territorial Halls). The Superblock is one of the most popular locations for on-campus housing because it has the largest concentration of students living on campus and has a multitude of social activities between the residence halls. There are four freshman residence halls on campus. Three—Bodien Hall, Getsch Hall, and Edgren Hall—encircle a cul-de-sac just south of the academic buildings, informally known as Freshman Hill. The fourth, Nelson Hall, is the largest of the freshman residences, and located nearby on the north side of the academic buildings. It is the oldest building on Bethel University's current campus in Arden Hills. Minnesota State was the traditional location of the summer training camp for the Minnesota Vikings National Football League team for 52 years from 1966 to 2017. Each year over 60,000 fans traveled to Blakeslee Stadium on the Minnesota State University campus athletics grounds to watch the team practice, fireworks, signing events, fan meet and greet and other events. In 2017, the Vikings ownership announced they would end the annual tradition as they built a new facility in Eagan, Minnesota to be completed in 2018. A single scholarship was named by the Vikings at the school after the end of the 2017 camp.
