 By Moni Basu, CNN (CNN) -- In the next few days, the Boy Scouts of America is expected to announce whether it plans to change its longstanding national policy against openly gay members. Many parents of Scouts have voiced their concerns, saying homosexuality goes against the teachings of their faith. But many others find the ban on gays out of sync with the ideals of scouting -- and of the nation as a whole. The Boy Scouts controversy perhaps illustrates where America stands on gay rights.  A fresh debate over the Boy Scouts of America's ban on gays sprang to life after word that the organization's leaders could be on the verge of a landmark change this week. Word of the possible move -- announced last week and up for consideration at a three-day meeting that begins Monday in Irving, Texas -- has sparked strong reactions from supporters and opponents. "Hopefully the BSA will make the decision to be more inclusive! I enjoyed my time as a scout, but would not want my future children to join an organization that doesn't promote equality," said Cole Fuller, one of thousands of readers who have shared their views in the comments sections of CNN's recent stories on the issue.  By Casey Wian and Michael Pearson, CNN Irving, Texas (CNN) -- Boy Scout executives won't vote this week on a proposal that would allow local troops to decide whether to welcome gay members and leaders. The national organization's executive board had been expected to vote on the proposal Wednesday, but said instead that it needs more time to get comment on the issue from its members. The decision will now be made at the organization's annual meeting in May. About 1,400 members of the group's national council will take part during that gathering, the board said.
