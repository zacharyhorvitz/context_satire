In 1881, facing dire financial circumstances, the university turned to William Bucknell, a charter member of the board of trustees, for help. His donation of $50,000 ($1,320,000 today) saved the university from ruin. In 1886, in recognition of Bucknell's support of the school, the trustees voted unanimously to change the name of the University at Lewisburg to Bucknell University. Bucknell Hall, the first of several buildings given to the university by Bucknell, was initially a chapel and for more than a half century the site of student theatrical and musical performances. From 1954 until 2004, the Press published the Bucknell Review , a biannual scholarly journal of letters, arts and sciences, which ceased publication after 47 volumes. The Bucknell Review  was published in hardback and paper cover and included work from some of the leading scholars in the humanities of the time. It was under the long editorship of Harry Garvin that the journal came to prominence. Bucknell Review  evolved out of Bucknell University Studies  (1949â€“1954). The 40 years from 1890 until 1930 saw a steady increase in the number of faculty members and students. When the Depression brought a drop in enrollment in 1933, several members of the faculty were "loaned" to found a new institution: Bucknell Junior College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Today, that institution is a four-year university, Wilkes University, independent of Bucknell since 1947.
