 The second Democratic presidential debate in as many days in Detroit is over. I watched, tweeted and took a whole lot of notes. Below are the best and the worst of the night that was -- in no particular order. (My winners and losers from Tuesday's Democratic debate are here.)  Democratic presidential candidate Tim Ryan's campaign said Wednesday the Ohio congressman was not protesting when he didn't put his hand over his heart during the national anthem at Tuesday's CNN debate in Detroit, chalking up the decision to a "moment of absentmindedness." Ryan was the only candidate of the 10 on stage to not place his right hand over his heart while the anthem was being played, as is customary. Instead, Ryan kept his hands clasped in front of him for the duration of the song. "Congressman Ryan wasn't protesting and didn't mean to make any statement last night in Detroit, it was a moment of absentmindedness while on a debate stage that won't happen again," the campaign said in a statement released Wednesday morning.  Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Thursday downplayed the notion that there was too much friendly fire exchanged during Wednesday's debate hosted in Detroit by CNN, saying the crossfire is a natural part of the primary process. Gillibrand was one of several candidates who on Thursday brushed off the idea that there was too much Democrat-on-Democrat criticism at Wednesday's debate, which featured 10 candidates openly sparring over hot-button issues, including health care and immigration. "On the stage last night, was there too much friendly fire?" CNN's Alisyn Camerota asked Gillibrand on "New Day."
