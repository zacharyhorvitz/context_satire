The music video (directed by Walter A. Stern) is a homage to the single continuous shot docu-fiction music video for Massive Attack's "Unfinished Sympathy". It focuses on Ashcroft singing while walking down a busy London pavement, without changing his stride or direction throughout, except for one instance where he is forced to stop for a moving car and a reflection is seen of him standing stationary in the car's tinted window. He narrowly avoids being hit by a car as he starts his walk, repeatedly bumping into passers-by (causing one young woman to lose balance and fall), and he also jumps on top of the bonnet of another vehicle stopped in his path (the driver gets out of her car and proceeds to confront him, while he continues unflinchingly). At the end of the video, the rest of the Verve join Ashcroft, and the final shot sees them walking down the street into the distance. "Bitter Sweet Symphony" is a song by English alternative rock band the Verve. It is the lead track on their third studio album, Urban Hymns (1997). It is based on a sample it uses from the Andrew Loog Oldham orchestral cover of the Rolling Stones' song "The Last Time", and involved some legal controversy surrounding a plagiarism charge. As a result, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were added to the songwriting credits, and all royalties from the song went to former Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein. "Home Sweet Home / Bittersweet Symphony", also known as "Bittersweet Home" is a song by American rap rock group Limp Bizkit. It was released in December 2005 as the only single from the compilation album Greatest Hitz. The song is a medley of "Home Sweet Home" by Mötley Crüe and "Bitter Sweet Symphony" by The Verve. It is, along with the songs "Why" and "Lean On Me", the only new content on the Greatest Hitz compilation, and is the third cover song Limp Bizkit has released on an album (the others being The Who's "Behind Blue Eyes", and George Michael's "Faith").
