The South Side is an area of the city of Chicago. It is the largest of the three Sides of the city that radiate from downtownâ€”the others being the North Side and the West Side. (While there is no East Side, because Lake Michigan runs along the city's eastern border, there is an East Side community area on the South Side, in the far southeastern section of the city.) The South Side is sometimes referred to as South Chicago, although that name can also refer to a specific community area on the South Side.
