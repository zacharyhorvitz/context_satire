On the other hand, Andrea is a central figure on the season 8 episode "Reunion", which marks the gang's fifth-year high school reunion. She comes back to Beverly Hills for the reunion, everyone assuming that this "Super Woman", voted most likely to succeed in high school, managed to have it all: career, baby, and happy marriage. When we first see Andrea again she is on the phone with Jesse, having an argument about their life in CT, yelling that she didn't "want to be changing diapers for the rest of her life". She quickly wipes away her obvious tears, and begins to pretend that her life indeed is perfect, and that all is well. From that point on much of the romantic tension between the characters subsides, with Brandon dating a fellow student named Nikki, and Andrea continuing to date Jay in an offscreen, long distance relationship. Both happened to get dumped on the same day, and while watching "It's a Wonderful Life" together, they begin to passionately kiss. Andrea stops the kiss, accusing him of thinking of Nikki; he in turn accuses her of thinking of Jay, and things spiral quickly into a heated argument. They, once again, reconcile by the end of the show. The last romantic tease between the characters happens at the Senior Prom. Andrea's then boyfriend, and Brandon's friend from another high school, Jordon Bonner, supposedly gets sick right before he was due to take Andrea to the prom. Brandon, who had no plans to attend, is encouraged by friend Steve Sanders to ask Andrea. They go to prom together, with him breaking his "no dancing" rule for her, telling her that there was no one else in the world he'd rather be there with than her, and generally having a wonderful time.
