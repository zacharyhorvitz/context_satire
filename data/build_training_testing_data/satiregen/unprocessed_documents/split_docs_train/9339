In June 2016, it was announced that Gibson had begun work on a sequel to The Passion of the Christ focused on the resurrection of Jesus. Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay for Braveheart (1995) was also penned as screenwriter. In September, Gibson expressed his interest in directing it. He estimated that the film would be released in a few years, as it is a big project. Although Mel Gibson wanted to call his film The Passion, on October 16, 2003, his spokesman announced that the title used in the United States would be The Passion of Christ because Miramax Films had already registered the title The Passion with the MPAA for the 1987 novel by Jeanette Winterson. Later, the title was changed again to The Passion of the Christ for all markets. In June 2016, Gibson announced that he will reunite with Braveheart screenwriter Randall Wallace to make a sequel for The Passion of the Christ, focusing on the resurrection of Jesus. In early November 2016, Gibson revealed on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that the sequel's title will be Resurrection. He also stated that the project could "probably be three years off" because "it's a big subject".
