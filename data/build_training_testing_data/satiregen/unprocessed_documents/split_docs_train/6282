 Former New York Gov. George Pataki said Tuesday that Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is sucking all the oxygen from the 2016 Republican field with a divisive message. "There is so much attention being paid to one candidate, as we constantly hear in the news," Pataki told CNN's "New Day." "The angry candidate, the one who is looking to divide is the one getting the attention right now."  A top aide to Donald Trump is saying he will show CNN's Chris Cuomo how much Trump pays the women in his organization if other candidates -- from both parties -- do the same. "The thing about Mr. Trump's leadership is really about proof of performance," Trump Executive Vice President Michael Cohen told CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day" Monday. "Unlike the others -- like Hillary (Clinton) ... said that she's the only one that can really understand women's rights and so on -- Donald Trump's been living this for more than 30 years. He's not a gender-based payer.  Rep. Steve King, an influential conservative Republican from Iowa, said Monday he believes Donald Trump is leading the Republican presidential field when it comes to immigration. "I think today he is the leader on immigration," King told CNN in an interview at the Iowa State Fair. "There's no question about that." King said he was "very happy" to see Trump release his policy paper outlining his position on immigration and border security on Sunday and said many of the positions are based on bills and amendments he's introduced in Congress.
