 Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, delivered the following prepared statement prior to Robert Mueller's testimony on Wednesday. Read the remarks below. For two years leading up to the release of the Mueller report and in the three months since, Americans were told first what to expect, and then what to believe. Collusion, we were told, was in plain sight, even if the special counsel's team didn't find it.  Expectations were high among Democrats that former special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday would be the spark they needed to persuade a skeptical American public that President Donald Trump had obstructed justice -- and, perhaps, that impeachment was the right recourse for the President's actions surrounding the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It didn't turn out that way. That's not to say that Mueller's testimony in front of the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees was filled with great news for Trump. Like Mueller's eponymous 448-page report detailing the findings of his nearly-two-year-long investigation into Russian interference and possible obstruction of justice, the former special counsel's testimony confirmed that Trump was not cleared on the charge of obstruction nor was Mueller's report a total exoneration of the President.  A Republican congressman who used much of his allotted questioning time during former special counsel Robert Mueller's congressional hearing on Wednesday to defend President Donald Trump has been under consideration for a job within the administration, sources tell CNN. "I agree with the chairman, this morning, when he said Donald Trump is not above the law. He's not. But he damn sure shouldn't be below the law, which is where volume two of this report puts him," Rep. John Ratcliffe said of Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
