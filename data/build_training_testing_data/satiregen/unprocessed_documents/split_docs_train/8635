In some countries, they are also known as Raisinets, which is the earliest and one of the most popular brands of the product, currently made by Ferrara, a subsidiary of Ferrero SpA. Raisinets were introduced in the United States in 1927 by the Blumenthal Chocolate Company. Ferrero acquired the brand in 2018 from Nestl√©, who had briefly expanded the brand to include milk chocolate-covered dried cranberries and dried cherries from late 2009 through 2013. A large number of other brands also exist, including: Chocolate-covered raisins are a popular bulk vending product. They consist (as the name suggests) of raisins coated in a shell of milk, dark or white chocolate. They are an item typically found at concession counters. Supermarket chains also sell them in bags and they were traditionally sold by weight, from jars, in candy stores. The company was founded in 1909 and existed under Blumenthal family management until 1969 when it was sold to Ward Foods, a New York-based conglomerate best known for making Tip Top bread. The principal reason for the sale, reportedly, was that few of the third generation of Blumenthals were interested in managing the company. After the sale, a new company, Ward Candy, was formed with Bernhard S. Blumenthal as its president. Following the death of Al Ehrlich, one of the managers of the company, the company experienced financial difficulties, prompting the sale of the company's brand names to Nestle in early 1984.
