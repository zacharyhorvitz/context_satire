Born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Morse lived with his siblings and grandparents in Jamaica until the age of six when he moved back to his birthplace. Morse, raised by his single mother, attended Nova High School in Davie, Florida, the alma mater of fellow major leaguer Anthony Swarzak. At Nova High, Morse was also a quarterback for the football team, following in the footsteps of his older brother, T.K. Morse and his siblings began their education in a one-room school near Verona. However, the Morse parents, particularly Jessie, shared the Progressive belief that improvement of self and society came through good education, and they admired the schools in Madison. After Morse finished second grade, his parents enrolled him in Longfellow School in Madison, to which Morse commuted 22 miles (35Â km) round-trip daily by riding relay on three of the family's smaller horses. After eighth grade, Morse attended Madison High School, where he became class president and debating club president, and placed academically among the top 10 in his graduating class. On March 2, 2012, the students returned to school. A student from West Geauga High School, her mother, and a neighbor organized a "Line Up At Chardon" event via Facebook to welcome students back to Chardon High School. They had a sign saying "I'll Stand By You" (referring to the song by The Pretenders). More than 100 youths and children from surrounding school districts, including West Geauga, came to show support.
