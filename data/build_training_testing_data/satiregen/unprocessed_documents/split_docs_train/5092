Chouinard is most known for founding the clothing and gear company, Patagonia. In 1970 on a trip to Scotland, he purchased some rugby shirts and sold them with great success. From this small start, the Patagonia company developed a wide selection of rugged technical clothing. Around 1970, he became aware that the use of steel pitons made by his company was causing significant damage to the cracks of Yosemite. These pitons comprised 70 percent of his income. In 1971 and 1972, Chouinard and Frost introduced new aluminum chockstones, called Hexentrics and Stoppers, along with the less successful steel Crack-n-Ups, and committed the company to the advocacy of the new tools and a new style of climbing called "clean climbing." This concept revolutionized rock climbing and led to further success of the company, despite destroying the sales of pitons, formerly his most important product.  Outdoor retailer Patagonia and the Interior Department continued their public spat over US national monuments Tuesday on Twitter, trading barbs over each others' ties to "special interests." The company announced Tuesday that it plans to take legal action over President Donald Trump's move to dramatically shrink two national monuments in Utah, a move that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommended. Following that announcement, Zinke took aim at the retailer on a press phone call Tuesday, saying, "You mean Patagonia made in China? This is an example of a special interest."
