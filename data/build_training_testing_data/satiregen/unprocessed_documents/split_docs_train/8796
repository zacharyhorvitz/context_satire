 A federal judge in Maryland said Thursday that Christopher Hasson, a Coast Guard lieutenant accused of plotting a domestic terror attack, will be released from detention. Hasson had been indicted on weapons and drug charges, but did not face any charges related to terrorism or attempted murder -- a point his public defender made as she argued that the government's continued detention of him was unlawful. He pleaded not guilty last month on the weapons and drug charges. Judge Charles Day agreed that the government had not met a standard for continued detention but said he still had "grave concerns" about Hasson's alleged actions, which included amassing an arsenal of guns and tactical gear and searching online for the home addresses of two Supreme Court justices.  On Thursday, a federal judge in Maryland ruled that a Coast Guard lieutenant accused of plotting a domestic terror attack should be released from detention. The suspected white supremacist allegedly gathered numerous guns and tactical gear -- and reportedly planned to target Democratic politicians, Supreme Court justices and journalists. Despite the ruling, the judge said he had "grave concerns" about the suspect's actions. To get a better sense of what happens next and how the US legal system handles domestic terror threats, I reached out to CNN law enforcement analyst and former FBI special agent Josh Campbell. In February 2019, the FBI arrested United States Coast Guard Lieutenant Christopher Hasson, who was allegedly plotting to assassinate various journalists and political figures in the United States, including Omar. According to prosecutors, Hasson is a self-described "long time White Nationalist" and former skinhead who wanted to use violence to "establish a white homeland." Prosecutors also alleged that Hasson was in contact with an American neo-Nazi leader, stockpiled weapons, and compiled a hit list.
