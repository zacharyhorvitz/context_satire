 North Korean monitoring service 38 North said Wednesday the country's Punggye-ri nuclear site is "primed and ready" for a sixth nuclear test. "The activity during the past six weeks is suggestive of the final preparations for a test," 38 North analyst Joseph Bermudez told CNN. Their prediction comes as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday that North Korea may have the capability to deliver missiles equipped with sarin nerve gas. He and other analysts pore over commercial satellite imagery of the testing site, looking for signs of activity similar to that prior to other tests.  An attempted missile launch by North Korea on Sunday failed, US and South Korean defense officials told CNN. The attempted launch occurred a day after the regime of Kim Jong Un showed off a bevy of new missiles and launchers at a large-scale military parade on its most important holiday. A South Korean defense official said the action took place in Sinpo, a port city in eastern North Korea. That was the site of a ballistic missile test earlier this month in which the projectile fell into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.  Aggressive rhetoric on the Korean Peninsula continues to ratchet up. US Vice President Mike Pence reiterated this week that the "era of strategic patience" was over, days after Pyongyang attempted another missile launch and analysts warned a sixth nuclear test could be imminent. Through all the rhetoric and saber-rattling however, it can be difficult to answer what should be a simple question: North Korea is a nuclear-armed state with a wide-ranging missile program capable of medium to long-range strikes. It also possesses a large arsenal of conventional, chemical and biological weapons.
