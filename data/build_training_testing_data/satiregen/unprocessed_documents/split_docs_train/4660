 With a presidential election looming, politicians on both sides of the aisle are sparring over immigration in a battle that shows no sign of stopping. Some are pointing to a recent case -- a woman in San Francisco who was killed, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant who'd already been deported five times -- as another sign that the U.S. system is in serious need of an overhaul. But what are the numbers behind the rhetoric? Here's a look at some of the statistics, where they come from and what people on different sides of the debate say about them. In March 2014, the Pew Research Center issued a report about how "millennials in adulthood" are "detached from institutions and networked with friends." The report said millennials are somewhat more upbeat than older adults about America's future, with 49% of millennials saying the country's best years are ahead, though they're the first in the modern era to have higher levels of student loan debt and unemployment. Indeed, by analyzing U.S. Census data, demographer William H. Frey at the Brookings Institution found that, following the Great Recession, American suburbs grew faster than dense urban cores. For example, for every one person who moved to New York City, five moved out to one of its suburbs. Data released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2017 revealed that Americans aged 25â€“29 were 25% more likely to move from a city to a suburb than the other way around; for older millennials, that number was 50%. Economic recovery and easily obtained mortgages help explain this phenomenon.
