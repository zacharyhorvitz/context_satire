Although still a subunit of the EOP, the White House Office remains the centerpiece of the presidential staff system. In many ways it is closest to the president both in physical proximity, its top aides occupy most of the offices in the West Wing, and in its impact on the day-to-day operations, deliberations, policy agendas, and public communications of a presidency. During the transition to office and continuing throughout an administration, the president enjoys a great deal of discretion in terms of how the White House Office is organized.  The next time the White House wants to make a credible defense of President Trump's actions, who should it send to the podium? The answer is unclear, White House and Washington communications veterans say. The president is notoriously unreliable. Many of his top aides have demonstrated a willingness to mislead the American people.  A White House reeling from parallel crises won't find respite anytime soon: President Donald Trump, joined by first lady Melania Trump, will embark Friday on his first foreign trip, a five-country grind where the very issues of credibility and competence exposed by the past week's chaos will reverberate widely. White House officials originally regarded the international swing as a reset for a beleaguered President and his staff. Instead, the problems stemming from Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey, his reported disclosure of highly classified information to Russian officials and his alleged urging of Comey to end his investigation into now-fired national security adviser Michael Flynn seem destined to shadow him as he travels abroad for the first time. For a President who hasn't spent a single night in office away from one of his homes, the eight-day trip will prove a daunting entry into foreign diplomacy.
