 A series of "unprecedented" bushfires are raging through Australia's southeastern state of New South Wales, with three people dead and more than 1,000 firefighters battling five emergency-level blazes and dangerous conditions. At least seven other people remain missing in the blazes, New South Wales Rural Fire Services commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said at a press conference Saturday. One of those killed was found inside a vehicle, while the other had died in hospital while being treated for severe burns. The body of a third person was found on Saturday afternoon in a burnt-out home.  Fire officials are warning of "catastrophic fire danger" as firefighters battle dozens of blazes raging across the Australian state of New South Wales. There were 64 fires burning as of early Monday, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said in a tweet, with 40 yet to be contained. At least three people were confirmed dead in the blazes Saturday, said NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons, and another seven were missing. At that time, preliminary reports suggested more than 100 homes had been lost, Fitzsimmons said. At the time of the merger with Delta Air Lines, Northwest had a total of 320 aircraft with seven on order. It was also the last U.S. passenger airline to have a dedicated cargo fleet and cargo-only routes. The Northwest fleet was integrated into Delta's fleet on December 31, 2009.
