 President Donald Trump on Monday urged Venezuelan military officials to back the country's self-declared interim president Juan Guaido and allow humanitarian aid to flow into Venezuela. Speaking in Miami as humanitarian aid remained stalled at the Venezuelan border, Trump decried President Nicolas Maduro as a "Cuban puppet" and warned officials who have helped keep him in power that "the eyes of the entire world are upon you." The speech was Trump's latest effort to ramp up the public pressure on the Venezuelan autocrat following a series of US-led sanctions and diplomatic maneuvers aimed at ousting Maduro. "Two days ago the first US Air Force C-17 landed in Colombia loaded with crucial assistance, including thousands of nutrition kits for little Venezuelan children," Trump said.  Venezuelan opposition supporters returned to the streets on Tuesday, calling on embattled president Nicolas Maduro to let humanitarian aid into the economically crippled country. The demonstrations come nearly three weeks after a stand-off began between Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaido. The 35-year-old National Assembly leader has rejected Maduro's election last year as illegitimate, and declared himself the interim President of Venezuela. To the delight of his supporters, many Western nations and regional neighbors have recognized Guaido as the country's interim leader.  Our live coverage of President Trump's remarks has ended.

While he avoided tying Democratic politicians to the socialist government in Venezuela as he has in the past, President Trump briefly turned his speech on Venezuela to domestic politics, vowing the US will "never be a socialist country." "And to those who would try to impose socialism on the UnitedÂ States, we again deliver a very simple message: America will never be a socialist country," Trump said toward the end of his speech in Miami on Monday.
