Lester Watts (Chris Pratt) works at a liquor store, happily selling alcohol to minors while spending his spare money on his porno collection. His best friend since third grade, Carl (Brendan Hines) works a corporate job at his British fianc√©e's family's company. He wants to leave the job and work somewhere else, but she angrily tells him he has no choice and that he must stay; it is clear that she is completely in control of the relationship. In 1919, Bracken returned briefly to Ireland, finding his mother settled in County Meath. He distanced himself from Ireland and from his siblings who were in revolt over their father's inheritance, moving instead to settle in Liverpool. In 1920, he appeared at Sedbergh School (at that time in the West Riding of Yorkshire), claiming to be 15 years old and an Australian, to have been orphaned in a bush fire, and to have a family connection to Montagu Rendell, the then headmaster of Winchester College. Without fully believing this story, Sedbergh's headmaster, impressed by the depth of knowledge and eagerness to progress by the young Bracken, accepted him. Since leaving EastEnders in 1988, BBC bosses made numerous offers for her to return, but she did not accept any of the offers; recently she commented "Why tarnish the gorgeous creation that was Angie Watts?" Bosses finally gave up hope of ever tempting her to return, and in 2002 the character of Angie Watts died off-screen of alcohol poisoning and was brought home to be buried by her on-screen daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), who had returned to the show the previous year.
