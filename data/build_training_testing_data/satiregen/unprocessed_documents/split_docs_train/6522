 Tesla's profit streak is over. Big time. The electric car company said Wednesday that it lost $702 million last quarter. Its revenue was also down 37% compared to the prior quarter.  Tesla isn't backing away from its radical plans for self-driving cars. CEO Elon Musk and other Tesla executives explained to investors Monday their plans to have more than a million full self-driving Teslas on roads next year. The optimistic rhetoric contrasts with the rest of the autonomous-vehicle industry, which is increasingly cautioning how long and hard a road it will be to get such cars on streets en masse. Tesla has already forged ahead with its Autopilot software, which has been deployed in some vehicles since 2015 and handles minor driving tasks.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced at an investor event Monday that he expects the company to operate robo-taxis next year. The full self-driving vehicles would compete with ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. Musk pitched the robo-taxis as a way for Tesla owners to make money when they aren't using their vehicles. Tesla's program would let a Tesla owner rent out their vehicle for rides, with Tesla taking a cut of the revenue and the rest of the money going to the vehicle's owner.
