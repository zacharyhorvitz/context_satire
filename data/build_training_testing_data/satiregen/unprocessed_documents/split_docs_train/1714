By Emil Guillermo, Special to CNN (CNN) -- To the average American, the name Wilma Lamug may not have any meaning at all. But to the more than 3 million people in the Filipino-American community, the name could some day be as important as that of Rosa Parks. House music first got its start within the walls of Chicago's Warehouse nightclub, thus attaining its name. As the music moved to the wider community, the sound significantly changed and what developed is House music as it eventually came to be known. While one of his biggest influences, and another instrumental figure in the development of house, Frankie Knuckles, confined himself to the gay nightclub scene (primarily that of the Warehouse), Saunders took the unique sounds of the Windy City to the masses. Instead of relying solely on disco and R&B like Knuckles, Saunders expanded his musical repertoire and fused it with the turntable trickery that remains a staple to this day.  American Airlines and its pilots union blamed each other Monday for a surge in flight cancellations and delays tied to contract issues at the bankrupt carrier. Flight tracking service FlightStats.com says 103 flights were canceled as of midday, the second highest one-day number of cancellations since problems at the airline began on Sept. 16. That brought the total number of flights canceled to 570, or about 3.5% of its total schedule. Less than half of American's flights have been on time in the past eight days, according to FlightStats.
