In 2007, Sullivan expressed his first desire to sell his share in Birmingham City and openly admitted three reasons for a possible departure. "One, the geographical distance. I've said for years the journey to Birmingham is killing me. Two, I think deep down the public have had enough of us. On the day the takeover was confirmed, an emotional Sullivan said: "It's going to take time to sink in. We've been wanting to sit here for 20 years and together we owned 27 per cent of the club 22 years ago and it's taken us 22 years to get to where want to be. Both me and David are supporters, I went to university here and I lived in Hornchurch. David lived 50 yards from the ground for 20 years of his life and played for West Ham's youth team. Sullivan was appointed as managing director of West Ham Women, by his father, in 2017. He had been involved with the women's team since leaving school aged 16. In Sullivan's first year, he led an application to advance the club from the part-time third division to the Women's Super League; it was West Ham's first appearance in the top competition. In 2018 he was the subject of a BBC Three programme, Britain's Youngest Football Boss, focussing on his running of the club and on the lives of female footballers.
