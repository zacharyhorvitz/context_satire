Monday's testimony was highlighted by the appearance before the grand jury of Mrs. Jesse Warwick. The wife of a Monroe minister, she testified to seeing men in at least two carloads gather on a roadside in the vicinity of Monroe at some point between the stabbing of Hester and the incident at Moore's Ford. That event was believed to have been a rehearsal for the lynching. The government intended to show planning, possibly with the knowledge of Walton county law officers and Harrison. Kelly was an English-born traveling minister in town on the night of the murders. Kelly was described as peculiar, reportedly having suffered a mental breakdown as an adolescent. As an adult, he was accused of peeping and several times asking young women and girls to pose nude for him. On June 8, 1912, he came to Villisca to teach at the Children's Day services, which the Moore family attended on June 10, 1912. In July 2016, Moore was present and bore witness to the fatal shooting of her brother Shane Moore as he attempted to break and enter their mother's home, despite a "no contact" (restraining) order in place since the September 2015 assault of Moore's daughter. Moore was photographed by local media on the Jackson County Courthouse steps covered in bruises, and stated her brother attacked her on July 26 and her daughter Tucker "was protecting  during the shooting." According to a July 2016 article,  Moore "said she and her daughter had lived in fear of Shane Moore since January  and that Reed tried to protect her after Shane began assaulting Kelly the night of the shooting." Moore also stated, "I'd hate for people to think my daughter is a killer, because she's not," Kelly Moore said, adding that Reed was in "terrible" fear at the time.
