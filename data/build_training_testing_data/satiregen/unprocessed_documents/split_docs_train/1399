In February 2020, it was reported by the media that Morris had handed in a transfer request to the Cronulla board citing that he wished to join his brother Brett at the Sydney Roosters. Morris spoke to the media saying “I spoke to the boys at Cronulla and I know the timing isn’t ideal. It’s not because I’m unhappy with any of the boys at the Sharks, But this is a unique opportunity. My brother isn’t just any old mate, this is the bloke who I started this journey with, “Now another opportunity has presented itself and I’d regret it for the rest of my life if I didn’t try and make it happen". Morris has also appeared in American television as a series regular on Pretty Little Liars and Hand of God. He also had recurring roles on Once Upon a Time and New Girl. After the game had finished, Morris was asked by reporters if he was angry at the state of the field following his latest injury. Morris replied "I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t, to be honest, "If it was the first time it happened to me I could brush it off, but it’s the second time I’ve been to Brookvale and my knee has dug in and I’ve had an injury as a result. As a player you work so hard to get out there, and to have this happen as a result of the ground is frustrating. Don’t get me wrong, I love being able to play at suburban grounds.
