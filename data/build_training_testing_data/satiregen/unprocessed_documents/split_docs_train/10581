 Chris Christie ripped into Ted Cruz's performance on the third night of the Republican National Convention, after the Texas senator was booed from the stage Wednesday night for declining to endorse Donald Trump. "I think it was awful. And quite frankly, I think it was something selfish," the New Jersey governor told CNN's Dana Bash. Christie, who is also a former 2016 rival, said Cruz broke the signed pledge he made to the Republican Party during the nomination process to support the eventual nominee.  Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman whose outsider campaign has both galvanized millions of voters and divided the Republican Party, is the 2016 GOP presidential nominee. The New Yorker's embrace by the Republican National Convention marks a remarkable moment in U.S. political history and validates a campaign that shattered precedent, defied pundits and usurped the GOP establishment. His son Donald Trump, Jr., cast the votes for the New York delegation that put the billionaire businessman over the top of the 1,237 delegates he needed to clinch the nomination, as any talk of disruptive protest votes or walkouts dissipated. "It is my honor to be able to throw Donald Trump over the top in the delegate count tonight with 89 delegates," Donald Jr. said, surrounded by three of Trump's other children -- Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany.  Ted Cruz stole the show, and then Donald Trump stole it right back. The long, divisive primary of 2016 played out in one final, spectacular episode on live television Wednesday night on the floor of the Republican National Convention. Here are seven takeaways from the penultimate night in Cleveland -- setting up a final note of drama when Trump takes the stage:  Cruz's 2020 gamble Ted Cruz placed a bet Wednesday night that could define his political life. It was a remarkable scene: The Texas senator took the stage and congratulated Trump for winning the Republican nomination.
