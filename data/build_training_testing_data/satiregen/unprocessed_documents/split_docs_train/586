As of April 2015, the US State Department estimated that 8.7 million American citizens live overseas. Americans living overseas are not counted in the US Census unless they are a US government employee or the dependent of a US government employee. A 2010 paper estimated the number of civilian Americans living abroad to be around 4 million. So-called 'accidental Americans' are citizens of a country other than the United States who may also be considered U.S. citizens or be eligible for American citizenship under American nationality law but are not aware of having such status, or have only become aware of it recently during adulthood. The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation and is one of a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right. While federal law does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations. 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits. In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. University of North Carolina law professor Hiroshi Motomura has identified three approaches the United States has taken to the legal status of immigrants in his book Americans in Waiting: The Lost Story of Immigration and Citizenship in the United States. The first, dominant in the 19th century, treated immigrants as in transition; in other words, as prospective citizens. As soon as people declared their intention to become citizens, they received multiple low-cost benefits, including the eligibility for free homesteads in the Homestead Act of 1869, and in many states, the right to vote. The goal was to make the country more attractive, so large numbers of farmers and skilled craftsmen would settle new lands.
