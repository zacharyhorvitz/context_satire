Cedar Point is a 364-acre (147 ha) amusement park located on a Lake Erie peninsula in Sandusky, Ohio. Opened in the late-1800s, it is reported to be the second-oldest operating amusement park in the United States behind Lake Compounce. Cedar Point is owned and operated by Cedar Fair and is considered the flagship of the amusement park chain. Known as "America's Roller Coast", the park features a world-record 72 rides, including 17 roller coasters â€“ the second-most in the world behind Six Flags Magic Mountain.  Want to play Superman or Wonder Woman and save the world? Or fight off an alien invasion as part of an intergalactic air force? Get ready to ride. Virtual reality roller coasters, 3-D and 4-D attractions and immersive "dark" rides that bring visitors into the storyline -- and sometimes even influence it -- will be heating up theme parks across the United States this summer.
