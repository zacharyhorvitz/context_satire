The Awakening is credited in the press as "South Africa's most successful gothic rock act and one of the top bands in the far broader alternative scene." The Awakening has had top charting radio singles and club rotation throughout South Africa, Europe, and the USA, and became the first gothic rock band to ever headline major national festivals throughout South Africa, including Oppikoppi and RAMfest, and has performed to crowds of 30,000+. In December 1999, Nyte took a break from The Awakening to concentrate on releasing his first solo album, The Slender Nudes. Nyte returned to The Awakening in September 2000, when he released The Fourth Seal of Zeen. The album displays a range of sounds between darkwave and classic gothic rock. The song "The Dark Romantics" became a gothic club dance floor anthem throughout the world, and remains one of the bandâ€™s most well-known singles to date. Heavy Rotation received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 66, which indicates "generally favorable reviews", based on 4 reviews. On September 3, 2008, Anastacia hosted an album listening party at the Bureau Club in Soho, London. On September 9, 2008, Capital 95.8 posted a review of that listening party, saying that Heavy Rotation is one of her strongest and most varied albums to date.
