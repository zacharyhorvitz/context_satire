 When the first bomb went off near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, emergency personnel knew to expect another. It occurred just 12 seconds later, and the first responders already present for Monday's  world-famous race that drew tens of thousands of visitors to the city immediately started moving people away from what had been a celebratory scene. In clearing the area so quickly, authorities acted on lessons learned from past terrorist attacks such as the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the Atlanta Olympics bombing in 1996 and the September 11, 2001, attacks, according to security experts. Major public events such as a marathon in a nation that prizes personal freedom can never be made perfectly safe, said Juliette Kayyem, a CNN contributor and former homeland security official.  This morning Bostonians are still reeling from the shock of a terror attack in their city. On Monday three people died in the twin bombings at the Boston Marathon including a 8-year-old boy who came to see his father run. The FBI is now leading the investigation into the twin explosions that left more than 150 others injured. This morning Former ATF Acting Director Michael Sullivan joins a special edition of “Starting Point” to weigh in on the latest.  In the hours after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, law enforcement officials were searching for a dark-skinned Middle Eastern man in connection to the attack that killed 168 people, including 19 children. Meanwhile, Timothy McVeigh, the real bomber, was getting away. Following the 1996 bombing at the Atlanta Olympics, investigators and the media initially focused on a local security guard named Richard Jewell. The real terrorist, Eric Robert Rudolph, who later admitted to planting the pipe bomb that killed two and injured 111 others, remained free until he was caught in 2003.
