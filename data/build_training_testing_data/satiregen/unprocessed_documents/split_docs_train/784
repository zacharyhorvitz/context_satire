Sarah Lawrence College is a private liberal arts college in Yonkers, New York. The college models its approach to education after the Oxford/Cambridge system of one-on-one student-faculty tutorials, which are a key component in all areas of study. Sarah Lawrence emphasizes scholarship, particularly in the humanities, performing arts, and writing, and places high value on independent study. Taylor hired a lawyer to defend and advise accused Sarah Lawrence faculty members, and organized the conference "Democracy and Communism in the Modern World," which brought together over 300 professionals and students from 40 educational institutions to discuss McCarthyism's attack on academic freedoms. Taylor urged students to fight for their academic rights and the rights of their professors, stating in his speech to students in 1951, "â€œI have one last thing to say. I believe that the most important possession we have at Sarah Lawrence College is our political and intellectual independence and our freedom to carry out a democratic educational program. We can only preserve this independence and this freedom if we all stand together as students and faculty against the attacks on this freedom from whatever quarter they may come."
