During his recovery, Favre proposed to Deanna. She was uncertain at first, but agreed when he went to get a marriage license and she was told she needed to come in and sign it. Deanna Tynes and Brett Favre were married on July 14, 1996, at St. Agnes Catholic Church in Green Bay. Hoffman met his wife, Tracy, in Buffalo, New York in 1992 where she was a real estate agent and a member of the National Football League's Buffalo Bills cheerleading squad. He asked her to marry him in 1993 while she was on the field during Super Bowl XXVII, which the Buffalo Bills lost to the Dallas Cowboys, 52â€“17. Hoffman and his wife have three sons: Brody, Quinn, and Wyatt. The short story involves Mr. and Mrs. White and their adult son, Herbert. They are sitting by the fire one evening, Mrs. White getting food ready and Mr. White is playing chess with Herbert, when Sergeant-Major Morris, a friend who served with the British Army in India, comes by for dinner and introduces them to a mummified monkey's paw. An old fakir placed a spell on the paw, so that it would grant three wishes. These three wishes are granted to the owner with hellish consequences as punishment for tampering with fate.
