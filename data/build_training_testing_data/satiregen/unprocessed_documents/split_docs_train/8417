Minnesota State was the traditional location of the summer training camp for the Minnesota Vikings National Football League team for 52 years from 1966 to 2017. Each year over 60,000 fans traveled to Blakeslee Stadium on the Minnesota State University campus athletics grounds to watch the team practice, fireworks, signing events, fan meet and greet and other events. In 2017, the Vikings ownership announced they would end the annual tradition as they built a new facility in Eagan, Minnesota to be completed in 2018. A single scholarship was named by the Vikings at the school after the end of the 2017 camp. By 1957, the mission of the institution had broadened to comprehensive 4-year college education, the state legislature changed the name of the college to Mankato State College. The following years saw additional enrollment growth. The Valley Campus was eventually sold to a private developer and the Highland Campus grew in size. By the 1960s the institution had grown so fast and so large that there was a bill created in the State Legislature to designate it the University of Southern Minnesota by state Senator Val Imm and later an amendment to the bill by state Representative Mike McGuire would have renamed it Minnesota State University. The State Legislature recognized the need for an education center in southern Minnesota by 1858. In 1860 the legislature chartered the development of state run normal schools to serve areas outside of Winona. The largest and fastest growing cities outside of Saint Paul, Saint Cloud and Mankato were selected for the sites dependent on local fundraising to establish the schools with seed money. Through the efforts of local attorney turned state legislator Daniel Buck, the newly formed City of Mankato donated $5,000 raised from the area community and sold $5,000 in bonds for the founding of the second state normal school, Mankato Normal School.
