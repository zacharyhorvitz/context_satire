Feeling sorry for the Grinch, Cindy invites him to celebrate Christmas at her house, which he awkwardly attends. When seated for dinner, he confesses that it wasn't really Christmas he despised, but being alone and neglected. With this, the Grinch finally accepts the Whos' friendship and enjoys Christmas with them. All the residents of Whoville (Whos) enjoy celebrating Christmas with the exception of the Grinch, a misanthropic and devious green-furred creature who hates Christmas as well as the Whos. As a result, nobody likes the Grinch due to the harmful stunts he pulls on them. Meanwhile, six-year-old Cindy Lou Who believes that everyone is missing the point about Christmas by focusing too much on the gifts and festivities and too little on the personal relationships. She then has a face-to-face encounter with the Grinch at the post office and later discovers his tragic past. The Grinch is a bitter, grouchy, cave-dwelling creature who hates Christmas. He resides on the snowy Mount Crumpit, a steep high mountain just north of the town of Whoville, home of the merry and warm-hearted Whos. His heart has been "two sizes too small". His only companion is his unloved, but loyal dog, Max.
