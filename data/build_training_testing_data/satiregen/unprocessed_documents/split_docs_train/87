 Millions of American Catholics, like me, are excited that Pope Francis is making his first journey to the United States.

He reminds us to speak out for the persecuted, advocate for the unborn, comfort the afflicted and welcome the stranger. The pundits would like to make him out to be a politician, but his charge is much greater than that: He is the spiritual leader to the largest group of Christians on Earth and an inspiration to all people of good will.  As Pope Francis prepares to visit the United States for the first time, the world is waiting to hear what he will say about key issues facing the church. The Pope is known for tackling sensitive topics head on. But for all his surprises and proclamations, what has Pope Francis done to address the issues facing the Roman Catholic Church?

Pope Francis is no longer the undisputed homecoming king. As he visits the United States for the first time, the Pope's approval ratings here, according to Gallup, have taken a tumble, from 76% in 2014 to 59% today. Pity Pope Francis! He washes the feet of the poor, talks of forgiveness and stresses care of the planet.
