 Apple announced on Monday that it would phase out iTunes on its upcoming operating system in favor of three new apps: Music, TV and Podcasts. Though iTunes as we know it will be no more, you don't have to worry about losing those iTunes playlists you made back in the summer of 2006. The platform's features will still exist on macOS Catalina -- they'll just be spread out across the different apps, similar to how they are on iOS. Here's what Apple says that will look like.  The music industry has changed dramatically since Apple disrupted the way people buy songs and albums nearly two decades ago. So Apple is phasing out iTunes in favor of three more modern apps. Apple announced Monday that iTunes will be replaced by a trio of desktop apps called Music, TV and Podcasts -- similar to how these services are already divided on iPhones and iPads. It will still exist as a standalone iOS app and on Windows PCs. Cook's executive changes occurred after the third quarter of the fiscal year, when revenues and profits grew less than predicted. One commentator said that Forstall was forced to step down, as Cook "decided to lance the boil as internal politics and dissent reached a key pitch". Since becoming CEO, Cook focused upon building a harmonious culture that meant "weeding out people with disagreeable personalitiesâ€”people Jobs tolerated and even held close, like Forstall"; although, another journalist said that "Apple's ability to innovate came from tension and disagreement." On February 28, 2014, Cook made headlines when he challenged shareholders to "get out of the stock" if they didn't share the company's views on sustainability and climate change.
