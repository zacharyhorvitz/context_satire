The 85th Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), honored the best films of 2012 and took place on February 24, 2013, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles beginning at 5:30 p.m. PST / 8:30 p.m. EST. The ceremony was the first in the Academy's 85-year history to adopt the phrase "The Oscars" as the ceremony's official name during the broadcast and marketing. During the ceremony, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories. The ceremony was televised in the United States by ABC, and produced by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron and directed by Don Mischer.  One of the most surprising moments of this year's Oscars came at the very end, when first lady Michelle Obama showed up on video to help announce the best picture winner. If you're anything like us, you immediately wondered what the significance could be, especially since she was announcing the award from the White House. But when you think about it, having Obama help draw the Oscars ceremony to a close was a fitting way to end this politically saturated awards season. The real-life drama of D.C. politics can be absorbing enough on its own, but mix in Hollywood machinations and you could create a must-see movie. Among its various accolades, the film was chosen by the American Film Institute and the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of the year. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, it won a leading three awards, including Best Motion Picture â€“ Musical or Comedy and Best Supporting Actor for Pitt. It received 10 nominations each at the 92nd Academy Awards and the 73rd British Academy Film Awards; both ceremonies have included nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (DiCaprio), and Best Supporting Actor (Pitt).
