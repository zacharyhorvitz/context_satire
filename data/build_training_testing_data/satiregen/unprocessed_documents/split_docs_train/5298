The Olay brand strives to understand more about the biology of skin and utilize large portions of their resources to research and development. Examples of their most recent research projects include the "Multi-Decade and Ethnicity Project", which was launched in 2012 with their partners, 23andMe. The objective of the project was to research the genealogical science of skin aging. The final results were presented to the 23rd World Congress of Dermatology in June 2015. In August 2016, Olay launched a new innovative tool called the Skin Advisor, designed to help consumers find the right product for their exact skin type. After uploading a selfie and answering some skin care questions, the Skin Advisor will analyze your skin, tell you your skin age and provide product recommendations for any problem areas. The Olay brand has expanded into a range of other products grouped into "boutiques" including Complete, Total Effects, ProX, Regenerist, Regenerist Luminous, Classics, Fresh Effects, Body (North America) and White Radiance (Asia). Olay is the market leader in many countries including the US, UK, and China. Olay has extended its heritage as a moisturizer to stay looking young, to formally creating the "anti-aging" category in mass stores with the launch of Total Effects in 1999. Active Hydrating Formula, generally the least expensive variety, bears the closest resemblance to the pink "Oil of Olay" marketed in the US before the P&G acquisition.
