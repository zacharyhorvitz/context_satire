During the 1990s, intercompany crossovers were a popular trend in the American comic book industry and management at Archie Comics wanted to participate to raise its visibility in specialty comic shops and boost sales. During a lunch in San Diego, top Archie editor Victor Gorelick discussed possibilities with writers Batton Lash and David Scroggy. After considering crossovers with Superman's friend Jimmy Olsen or Spider-Man, Gorelick mentioned Punisher as a joke. Lash immediately saw potential in the idea and gave a rough explanation for how it would work. Cavanaugh of ComicBook.com described the fifth and final issue as "ambiguous and underwhelming" but again praised the artwork, which he felt " the book work well tonally, even without a single bubble of dialogue." With a rating of 4 out of 5, he concluded, "The dialogue between the characters feels authentic and engaging, yet the events of the actual book feel as though the storyline ran out of steam and serves more as a collection of scenes than an organic ending." Beyond The Panel's Jideobi Odunze gave the issue an overall rating of 7.5 out of 10. He offered a mixed reaction to the artwork, criticizing the amount of off-panel action, but wrote, "The only thing that really sold those moments were the reaction shots and terrified expressions. In reviewing the debut issue, a number of critics expressed displeasure regarding the absence of the Jughead: The Hunger side of the narrative. However, several of them affirmed the series' potential. Patrick Cavanaugh of ComicBook.com considered the "creepy and campy" issue to be a "strong start" to the series. He gave the first issue a rating of 4 out of 5, writing, "Fans of horror movies and the retro vibe of Archie Comics will find a lot to love in every single panel of this series, with a tone that falls in line with the earlier adventures of Vampironica."
