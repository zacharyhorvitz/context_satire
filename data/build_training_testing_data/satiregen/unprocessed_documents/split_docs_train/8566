 In pushing the boundaries of human endurance, extreme athletes and pregnant women are unmatched, a new study says. The average person can burn up to 4,000 calories -- a limit a group of scientists consider the peak of human performance -- before depleting the body's energy stores. And while extreme distance runners reach maximum performance during high-intensity races, expectant mothers often hit the same mark at a lower intensity over a longer period of time, typically without completing a triathlon. In the group's findings, published in the journal Science Advances, participants completed Herculean events like the 2,200-mile Tour de France and the 140-day Race Across the USA.  CPR mannequins are getting breasts -- with the goal of saving women's lives. The so-called Womanikin is an attachment for flat-chested CPR dummies that aims to change the finding that women are 27% less likely than men to receive CPR if they suffer from a cardiac arrest in public. Researchers suspect bystanders' reluctance to touch the chest of woman they don't know might play a role. So, the New York ad agency JOAN Creative, along with the organization United State of Women, created the Womanikin to try to normalize performing CPR on women.  The longest economic expansion in modern American history could come to a screeching halt right before the 2020 presidential election. At least that's what US finance leaders fear. Nearly half (48.1%) of chief financial officers in the United States are predicting the American economy will be in recession by the middle of next year, according to the Duke University/CFO Global Business Outlook survey released on Wednesday. And 69% of those executives are bracing for a recession by the end of 2020.
