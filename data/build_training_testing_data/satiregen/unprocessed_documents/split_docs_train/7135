On December 12, 2007, it was announced on the air that Adam had come down with an illness and would not be coming to host the show. Danny and Teresa continued the show with Bryan taking a more active role as an on-air talent. On-air talent remarked many times that this was an unusual situation and that Adam has attended work while sick many times before and that he would have to be very sick in order to stay home. KLSX Program Director Jack Silver stated, "I have to take Adamâ€™s word. Originally recorded nightly at his home, the podcast eventually moved to be recorded in a studio and features conversations with many of the same guests who appeared on the radio show. In the inaugural podcast, Carolla stated that if the venture proved to be successful he would move forward with ambitious plans to expand it commercially upon the expiration of his CBS contract. The show quickly garnered a large audience, as the first episode was downloaded over 250,000 times in the first 24 hours of its being made available on the site. Soon after, the show was made available on iTunes and in its first week the podcast was downloaded over 1 million times, making it the number one iTunes podcast in the US and Canada. On December 28, 2006, Carolla posted to the show's message boards and wrote that network executives had wanted to replace Dameshek because of the show's poor performance in Los Angeles. Carolla said the show's Arbitron ratings in the city shifted from 1.2 to 3.3 to 0.7, and CBS used this as an excuse to "strip the show". On the January 2nd show, Carolla commented on the firings and confirmed his posting that they were due to low ratings. He said that he had no say in the decision, and while he was upset about the firings he expressed a desire to move on.
