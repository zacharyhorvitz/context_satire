The second modification was done to raise the desk by adding a separate, uniform base called a plinth. The first time a base was made for the Resolute desk was during the John F. Kennedy Administration. It was made of pine and did not match the desk well. It is very visible in a photo of John F. Kennedy Jr. playing under the desk. Traditionally, the addresses are delivered with the President sitting at the Resolute desk speaking into the camera. Occasionally, however, the President will stand at a lectern on the opposite side of the Oval Office and give the address. Previously, it was also common for an artificial background to be placed behind the President, ordinarily consisting of plain blue fabric. Since the administration of Jimmy Carter, the preference has instead been for the natural backdrop of the Office's windows.  Jeremy Bernard, the first man to hold the job of White House Social Secretary, is stepping aside, the East Wing announced Wednesday. Bernard, a popular member of the White House staff, also happens to be the first openly gay man to serve in the role, a source of pride for the administration. â€‹ Michelle Obama gushed about Bernard in a statement: "For the last four years, Jeremy has worked tirelessly to open the doors of the White House to as many people as possible and to make each and every event in the White House one to remember," she said. "I was lucky to have such a talented individual on my team, and I am equally lucky to have made a lifelong friend in Jeremy."
