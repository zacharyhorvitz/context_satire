Fisher-Price recalled all models of their Rock 'n Play sleeper on 12 April 2019. The product was introduced in 2009, and holds the sleeping baby in an inclined position. More than 30 infants have died while sleeping in a Rock 'n Play. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said these deaths occurred "after the infants rolled over while unrestrained, or under other circumstances." The fourth recall in 2019  involved the Barbie Dream Camper model FRC29 with the grey foot pedal due to the fall hazards and pedal issue that causes the ride-on to keep moving when the pedal was released. Customers were to take the ride-on to an authorized service center for a free repair or schedule for an in home repair. The product was sold at Walmart stores nationwide and online at Walmart.com from July 2018 through January 2019 for about $400. Fisher-Price has received 17 reports of the power wheels continuing to run after the foot pedal was released. In 1988, Marvel Productions made an animated series of 6 Little People videos such as Favorite Songs, 3 Favorite Stories, A Visit to the Farm, Fun With Words, Jokes Riddles and Rhymes, and Christmas Fun, which were released by New World Video. This video series centered around two children named Timmy and Penny and their Baby Sister, their parents, and their dog Lucky. In 1991, the Original Little People figures were redesigned for children. They were made "chunkier", were more bright and colorful, and were designed so that they could activate motion within the play sets.
