 Democrats honored fallen police officers with a moment of silence Thursday night and appearances by family of those killed in the line of duty at their national convention. The tribute, in the lead-up to the marquee address by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on the final evening of the 2016 convention, came after Democrats earlier in the week heard from mothers whose unarmed children were killed by police or died in their custody. The appearances come as tensions between the police and many African-American communities have soared after killings of both officers and residents. "I've been trying to make sense of it, but violence is not the answer," Dallas Sheriff Lupe Valdez said Thursday.  Bill Clinton's history of speeches at the Democratic National Convention has been like his political career, a series of ups and downs, where the former president has played the role of validator, acceptor and character witness. The 42nd commander in chief has been allotted most of the 10 p.m. prime-time hour Tuesday night and Clinton aides expect him to speak for over 45 minutes. This will be the 10th speech Clinton has delivered to the DNC in his career. Clinton, who worked on the remarks holed up in the Logan Philadelphia hotel, wrote the entire speech by hand and without the input of people who regularly help him on remarks, aides said.  It is official. He's with Her. On Monday night, Bernie Sanders finally did what all runners-up for a presidential nomination are tasked with doing. It is not easy and it certainly is humbling (ask Hillary Clinton, circa 2008).
