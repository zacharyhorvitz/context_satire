 One of the big questions we'll be parsing after Election Day is the strength of the Republican brand in the age of Donald Trump. Several weeks ago, it looked like Trump was inflicting serious damage on the GOP. But then the race tightened and is a nail-biter in the final hours. We'll be looking for answers about the future of the Republican Party in the results of the down-ballot races -- particularly the races that will determine control of the Senate.  Donald Trump reflected Monday on the movement that has propelled his candidacy, and let loose on the stump as during his last full day of campaigning ahead of Election Day. The Republican presidential nominee also reminisced on his successes and called attention to the lasting impact he believes his campaign will have on the country, even if he doesn't win the presidency Tuesday. "It's been some campaign. It's been some campaign," Trump said after taking the stage here to a rousing reception.  When voters go to the polls Tuesday in the heavily Democratic state of California, they will see three words next to the name of Donald J. Trump: "Republican, American Independent." That's because in the nation's most populous state, Trump is not only the Republican nominee but also the nominee of the American Independent Party, a political party that traces its roots to the late 1960s, when Alabama Gov. George Wallace ran for president on a platform supporting racial segregation. "We think of  as our battering ram," Markham Robinson, the secretary of the American Independent Party, told CNN.
