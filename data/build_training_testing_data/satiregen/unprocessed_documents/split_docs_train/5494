The local co-ed high school for students aged 12–18. It is also used as a shelter in extreme weather conditions such as cyclones and has been the scene of a hostage situation. During Donald Fisher's reign as principal, Adult Evening classes were often held. The school was rebuilt in 1996 following a major earthquake that occurred in Summer Bay that year. Mangrove River is a neighbouring suburb to Summer Bay, often mentioned in the earlier years of the programme. Its first mention came in 1989 when Tom Fletcher and Alf Stewart were hospitalised there after being lost at sea. Tug O'Neale lived there and attended school until Year 10 when he transferred to Summer Bay High. Vinnie Patterson originally lived in Mangrove River before coming to the Bay. Historically, the earliest settlers of Tabina were the Subanens who have settled in the different parts of the Zamboanga Peninsula. They are followed by the Muslims, and then the Christians. The name itself has many different origins, open to interpretation. One states that it comes from the inhabitants’ expression of “tabi-una”, a polite expression meaning “excuse me”.Â  Another points out to the inhabitants’ characteristic expression of being talkative which, in the local tongue, is being “tabi-an”.
