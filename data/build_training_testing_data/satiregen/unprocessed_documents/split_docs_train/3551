 John Kasich needs delegates. He needs money. He needs votes. So far, he's running short on all three.  Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump called for rival John Kasich to pull out of the race because he mathematically cannot capture enough delegates to win the nomination before the national convention. "Kasich shouldn't be allowed to run. Honestly, Kasich should not be allowed to run," Trump told reporters Sunday while visiting a diner in Milwaukee, adding, "He hurts Trump much more than he hurts (Ted) Cruz." He pointed out the Ohio governor has only won one contest, the primary in his home state.  With the Wisconsin primary less than a week away, Tuesday night's GOP town hall was by no means a pro forma event; it was one of the last real opportunities for the remaining three candidates to adapt their campaign narratives before the delegate math is set. Only two candidates -- Donald Trump and Ted Cruz -- have a mathematical shot at the nomination, and the CNN forum gave voters a chance to size them up while they are locked in an all-out campaign dogfight. If you are a small-government, constitutional conservative, the Ted Cruz you wanted to see showed up. His strengths -- his intellectual firepower, policy depth and unshakable poise -- were on full display.
