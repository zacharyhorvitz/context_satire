 Wednesday's show of solidarity among the press was a welcome sight after years of giddy media-bashing by President Donald Trump, which has gone largely unreproved by his friendliest outlets. In a rare rebuke from Trump's preferred news outlet, Fox News, anchor Bret Baier read a statement from the network in defense of none other than the President's favorite news foe, CNN:  "Just because the White House is uncomfortable with a question regarding the news of the day doesn't mean the question isn't relevant and shouldn't be asked. This decision to bar a member of the press is retaliatory in nature and not indicative of an open and free press. We demand better.  The ultra-competitive White House press corps is displaying something rare and refreshing: Solidarity. Journalists reacted with dismay when the Trump administration barred CNN's Kaitlan Collins from attending a presidential event in the Rose Garden. Two White House officials, Bill Shine and Sarah Sanders, told Collins that she asked "inappropriate" questions during Trump's meeting with European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. So the ban was retaliatory in nature. In July 2018, Collins was barred from a Trump administration press conference in the White House Rose Garden. Collins said that she was barred from the event after asking Trump questions about Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen in the Oval Office. Collins said she was told by senior White House officials that such questions were "inappropriate for that venue." Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders asserted that Collins "shouted questions and refused to leave," while Trump's advisor Kellyanne Conway said that the action was about "being polite."
