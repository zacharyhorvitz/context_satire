 The search for debris that could belong to missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 evokes different emotions for relatives of the passengers. Some just want closure; others might have their hopes of seeing their loved ones alive dashed. The objects, seen in satellite images taken Sunday, have not been confirmed to be parts of the missing plane. The first search plane to fly over the area found no sign of debris.  In an incident where nothing can be ruled out, is it a surprise that some relatives of the passengers on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 are hoping it is a hijacking? To some it is a far-fetched conspiracy theory, and to others, it represents the only scenario that leaves open the possibility of seeing their loved ones alive. That's how some of the families of the missing in Beijing feel. Authorities have been unified in their preliminary conclusions that terrorism does not appear to be behind the plane's disappearance.  A woman wailed as security guards dragged her out of the briefing room used to provide updates on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. She is the mother of one of the passengers, and her protest is but one sign that patience is fraying among the relatives of the missing. The families of the passengers have been mostly out of the spotlight as Malaysian authorities spearhead a mission to find the plane. But as day 12 rolled around with no answers, the frustration became evident.
