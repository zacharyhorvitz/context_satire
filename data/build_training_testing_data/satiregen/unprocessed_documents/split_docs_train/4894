The Team members were the medical director of the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic since its foundation, Dr. John M. Leventhal, Dr. Julia Hamilton, who was also social worker and co-director of the Yale Medical Center Child Abuse Program, and Social Worker Ms. Sawyer, who had a masters in Social Work and ten years of experience. The social workers met Dylan in Yale New Haven every Friday for an hour or so. Kristi Groteke was interviewed for three hours. Maureen Orth stated that its conclusion was based, in part, on the view that Dylan had difficulty telling a consistent story and suffered from "thought disturbances."  Film director Woody Allen released a statement Sunday denying adopted daughter Dylan Farrow's allegation that he sexually assaulted her when she was 7 years old. In an open letter posted online Saturday by The New York Times, Farrow recounted her allegation that Allen sexually assaulted her in the attic of her adopted mother Mia Farrow's house in 1992. The statement released by Allen representative Leslee Dart said: "Mr. Allen has read the article and found it untrue and disgraceful. He will be responding very soon. Dylan's brother Moses Farrow, who was 14 in 1992, has taken a different view; he has reconciled with Allen and is now estranged from the Farrow family. When Dylan published her open letter, he said in an interview that several people had been in the house on the disputed day and that "no one, not my father or sister, was off in any private spaces". He asserted that Mia Farrow had cultivated a climate in which he and his siblings had felt compelled to support her views, and that she had both physically and emotionally abused him. He repeated the allegations in 2017 to Eric Lax, one of Allen's biographers.
