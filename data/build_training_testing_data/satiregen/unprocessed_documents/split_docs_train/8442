Under Rockstar Games, Rockstar Toronto has primarily been a porting house for games developed by other studios of Rockstar Games, but also developed the 2005 game The Warriors, based on the 1979 film of the same name, and co-developed Max Payne 3, as part of Rockstar Studios, in 2011. Following the release of Max Payne 3, Rockstar Vancouver was folded and merged into Rockstar Toronto, with the resulting company moving into new, bigger offices. Grand Theft Auto IV was released on 29 April 2008, after around four years of development, for both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, marking the debut of the developer's wildly popular Grand Theft Auto franchise on the seventh-generation of video game consoles. GTA IV was another huge financial and critical success, breaking sales records amongst all types of entertainment media. Rockstar North continued work on GTA IV in the form of two pieces of downloadable episodic content. The first of these, titled The Lost and Damned, was released on 17 February 2009, with the second, The Ballad of Gay Tony, released on 29 October 2009. On 8 April 2004, shortly after the European release of Max Payne for Game Boy Advance, Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of Rockstar Games, announced that they had acquired MÃ¶bius Entertainment. As part of the deal, the company became part of the Rockstar Games label, and would henceforth be known as Rockstar Leeds. Sam Houser, executive producer at Rockstar Games, stated that they were "very impressed with the  development team from the time they began work on the Game Boy Advance version of Max Payne". With the acquisition, Rockstar Games sought to strengthen their position in the market for Game Boy Advance and PlayStation Portable games, although the new studio's focus shortly shifted to only PlayStation Portable.
