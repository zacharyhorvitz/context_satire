Under the Constitution, the vice president serves as president of the Senate. He or she may vote in the Senate (ex officio, for he or she is not an elected member of the Senate) in the case of a tie, but is not required to.

Since the 1950s, vice presidents have presided over few Senate debates. Incumbent Republican senator Orrin Hatch announced in January 2018 that he would retire at the end of his current term and would not be seeking reelection. He was succeeded by Mitt Romney, who had been the Republican nominee for president in 2012 and previously was the 70th Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, becoming only the third person in American history to be elected governor and senator in different states. At 71, he additionally became the oldest person ever elected to the Senate as a freshman. Hatch announced on January 2, 2018 that he would retire from the Senate instead of seeking re-election that November. Hatch retired from the Senate on January 3, 2019, having served there for 42 years. At the time of his retirement announcement, he was the longest-serving U.S. Senator in Utah history (having eclipsed previous record-holder Reed Smoot in 2007) and the longest-serving Republican U.S.
