I do feel like I'm trying to change the way people think about their own lives with my standup. I'm not just trying to get a laugh from people, but I actually want people to walk out of there and critically analyze how we’re living our lives in this modern era. We're stuck on our Facebook pages and giving up our privacy in a surveillance society and we're forced to go through metal detectors and X-ray machines everywhere we go and giving up our freedoms and living in a fear-based society afraid of terrorism and war and all this stuff. There are a lot of outrageous things that are happening right now in our world that have never happened in my lifetime. From the age of ten, Eugene had been brought up for a career in the church; a personal choice of the King, basing the decision on the young Prince's poor physique and bearing.

A Hollywood couple argue about a film he wants to produce, unaware that thieves are planning to rob them of a precious diamond in their possession. A blind girl is reunited with her schoolmate—who is no longer blind. A lawyer tries to keep his wife from finding out about his girlfriend who is also on the cruise. A masquerade ball highlights the conclusion of the voyage.
