 Once supportive Senate colleagues -- they stood in for each other during their respective marathon Senate speeches -- soon-to-be rivals Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz are decidedly less chummy these days. Paul made it clear Monday night he plans on waging a debate against his fellow tea party Republican, Cruz, who on Monday declared himself a presidential candidate. READ: Why Ted Cruz is running now "Right now, I'm the only one that beats Hillary Clinton in certain purple states," Paul said on Fox News' "The Kelly File," talking about recent polls.  Ted Cruz is first out the gate. The first-term senator from Texas will announce Monday that he's running for the Republican presidential nomination, CNN has confirmed from two aides to Cruz. He will make his official declaration in Lynchburg, Virginia, at Liberty University, the largest Christian university in the world. The news was first reported by the Houston Chronicle.  Sen. Ted Cruz argued Monday that any potential White House candidate who's not willing to reject the emerging deal with Iran over its nuclear development is "not fit to serve" as president. Speaking at a Politics and Eggs breakfast in New Hampshire on Monday, Cruz urged the audience to press other contenders on whether they would "be willing to repudiate" a non-Congressional approved agreement reached with Iran should they become president. "Any candidate in my view who will not say 'yes' to that is not fit to serve as commander in chief of this country," said Texas Republican senator. Cruz was one of 47 GOP senators who signed a letter last week to Iran suggesting that the deal needs to be approved as a treaty by Congress in order for it remain a valid agreement when Obama leaves office in January 2017.
