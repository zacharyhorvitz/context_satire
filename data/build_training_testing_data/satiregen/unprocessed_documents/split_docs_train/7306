 If you have space-obsessed friends, you might have heard the words "Falcon Heavy" used a lot lately. Falcon Heavy is the name of a highly anticipated SpaceX rocket that's set to launch for the first time on Tuesday. Liftoff can happen anytime between 1:30 pm and 4 pm ET. You can attribute the buzz to the Falcon Heavy's size: It will be the most powerful rocket in the world.  SpaceX just launched its Falcon Heavy rocket for the first time ever, and it was quite the show. The rocket company -- headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk -- became the owner of the most powerful operational rocket in the world Tuesday when Falcon Heavy aced its maiden flight. It all kicked off at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where the Falcon Heavy awaited its debut at Launch Pad 39A. That's the same launch pad that hosted Apollo and Space Shuttle missions back in the heyday of U.S. human spaceflight.  Billionaires on Twitter: They're just like us. Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk exchanged social media pleasantries on Monday ahead of the much-hyped launch of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket. Musk's SpaceX is scheduled to launch its new rocket into orbit on Tuesday. It's poised to become the most powerful rocket in operation.
