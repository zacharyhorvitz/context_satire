Twelve years after the events of the first film, Danielle "Dani" Raymond (Alexandra Shipp), an upper class Brooklyn girl, defies her parents in order to attend a college in Atlanta so she can join and revitalize their once-prominent drum line. Dani's quest to become the first female section leader of the drum line in the school's history will be hampered by upperclassmen (including her cousin, Tyree (Jeff Pierre), her feelings for band mate and rival, Jayven (Jordan Calloway), and the school's crosstown rivals. The next day, the five friends go their separate ways: Rob leaves for Los Angeles with Joanie, Dennis heads off to school in Michigan, and Mickey and Chelsea begin dating. Slosh moves in with a group of new students he has befriended, and hangs the El Rancho sign on their house. As Jack leaves town, he stops at a restaurant where Dina is eating with her new boyfriend, and writes "angst for the memories" on the window as a farewell message to her. Wilkes was notoriously ugly, being called the ugliest man in England at the time. He possessed an unsightly squint and protruding jaw, but he had a charm that carried all before it. He boasted that it "took him only half an hour to talk away his face", though the duration required changed on the several occasions Wilkes repeated the claim. He also declared that "a month's start of his rival on account of his face" would secure him the conquest in any love affair.
