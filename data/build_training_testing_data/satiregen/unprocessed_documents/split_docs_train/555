After a storming start to the season, Chris Bridge was once again injured with a ruptured achilles tendon and this ruled him out for the rest of the season. Stuart Reardon, full back for the team, is also expected to have a full reconstruction of his achilles tendon, gained at the clash against St. Helens and is expected to be out for the rest of the season. Paul Wood is also likely to be out for the season, after a further injury to his shoulder. Warrington finished the 2007 season seventhin the table, which was seen as a disaster for the club following the impressive signings made during the close season. Finishing 7th resulted in Warrington missing out on the end of season playoffs for the first time in 3 years with local rivals Wigan pipping the Wire on the last weekend of the season. Stan gets drunk on a St. Bernard's keg of brandy, so that when he and Ollie are told to move the composer's piano to a treehouse where he can work in peace, Stan is not much help, especially when they have to cross a narrow rope bridge over a deep ravine to get there. While they are crossing, they have a confrontation with a local street musician's gorilla. The struggle ends with the bridge breaking and the piano and the gorilla plunging into the abyss.
