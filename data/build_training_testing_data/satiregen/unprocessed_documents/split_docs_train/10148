 A trio of national polls released ahead of the first presidential debate Monday all tell the same story: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are locked in an increasingly tight race. In the latest survey from Bloomberg, Trump edges Clinton in a four-way race that includes third party candidates, 43%-41%. Quinnipiac University, meanwhile, showed a virtual tie with Clinton edging Trump by a single point, 44%-43%. Each poll showed Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson polling at 8%, well below the 15% threshold he needed to qualify for Monday night's debate in Hempstead, New York. In May 2019, the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, "in conjunction the Dr. Christina Greer of Fordham University, the Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracyâ€™s conducted a poll of 113 academic researchers and asked them to rate the 14 modern presidents on both their overall leadership and rhetoric on diversity and inclusion using a scale ranging from 0 to 100." Survey respondents were significantly more liberal than the national average, with "with only 13 percent of the respondents describing themselves as either moderate, slightly conservative, or conservative." However, "similar patterns of ratings  across the ideological spectrum". In 2007, Quinnipiac University Poll underwent construction of a new two-story building that was expected to double its available capacity to 160 calling cubicles. The purpose of the capacity expansion was to allow polling multiple states at once, rectifying a problem that arose during the 2006 Connecticut Senate election where other polls were canceled to support that poll.
