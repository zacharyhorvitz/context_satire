 The massacre of some of France's top cartoonists has turned a American nightmare -- that Western jihadists could return from war on terror battlefields to wreak carnage at home --  into reality. One of the two brothers suspected in the slaughter at the offices of a satirical magazine on Wednesday recently spent time in Yemen getting weapons training with one of the most dangerous Al-Qaeda affiliates in the world, US officials briefed on the matter told CNN's Barbara Starr. And a French source close to the French security services says there is also evidence that one of the brothers, Said and Cherif Kouachi, has traveled to the the killing fields of Syria. The chilling revelations open up a potentially dangerous new phase of the struggle against global terrorism because thousands of European fighters are estimated to be fighting with ISIS and other extremist groups -- a rich pool of radicals who could overwhelm Western intelligence agencies should they come home with orders to sow terrorist panic at home.  France remains in mourning after attacks on magazine Charlie Hebdo and other targets, including a kosher grocery store, left 17 dead and more critically injured. Tributes have been pouring in to the victims, as well as messages of support for the magazine. People everywhere took to social media to express solidarity. #charliehebdo circled the globe, along with #jesuischarlie translated into scores of different languages.  Marchers raised pens skyward. They lit candles in the dark. They wrote "liberty" and "free expression" on placards in rallies that came hours after a terror attack killed 12 people Wednesday in Paris. As the initial shock wore off, the grand boulevards in most of France's major cities became scenes of mourning and solemn demonstrations, with crowds declaring themselves unbowed by the gunmen's assault on the offices of the magazine Charlie Hebdo.
