Travis grew up in a musical family having been influenced by his grandparents who inspired him to pursue guitar. At a young age, he was inspired by Counting Crows, Elliott Smith, and Heatmiser. Tilian Pearson, formerly of Tides of Man, was asked to replace Craig as clean vocalist during the making of his solo album, Material Me (2013). Pearson, along with guitarist Josh Benton and bass guitarist Tim Feerick, were confirmed as official members by Jon Mess. The band's fifth album, Acceptance Speech, was released on October 8, 2013 with Rise Records. The album was produced by Matt Malpass. After numerous trial and errors with Five Minute Ride and No Not Constant, as well as his folk music project There & Back Again, he joined the post-hardcore band O! the Joy. With the band, he released one full-length studio album, titled Zen Mode (2008), which was recorded at Tiny Telephone Recording Studios in San Francisco, California. Despite local success, the group disbanded the same year.
