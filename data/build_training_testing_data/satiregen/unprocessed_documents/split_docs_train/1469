Detachment is a chronicle of one month in the lives of several high school teachers, administrators and students through the eyes of a substitute teacher named Henry Barthes. Barthes' method of imparting vital knowledge to his temporary students is interrupted by the arrival of three women in his lifeâ€”the damaged and naive prostitute Erica, a fellow teacher and a troubled teen named Meredith (Betty Kaye). These women all have profound effects on Barthes' life, forcing him to both re-discover aspects of his own personality, and to come to terms with both the tragic suicide of his mother and the impending death of his grandfather. The film is punctuated with flashbacks of scenes of Barthes' young childhood and his mother's suicide. In July 2019, it was announced that Ana Brenda Contreras would not be returning for season three for personal reasons, and that Daniella Alonso would take over the role of Cristal. In August 2019 it was reported that Michael Michele had been promoted to a series regular for the third season, and it was announced in October 2019 that Adam Huber had been promoted to a series regular as well. On October 28, 2019, it was announced that the role of Alexis Carrington had been recast with Elaine Hendrix, who would appear as a series regular. The CW noted that "Alexis is back in Atlanta, with a new look, a new man, and plenty of scores to settle". In March 2012, cast member Bryan Cranston was asked about Detachment during an interview. The reporter told Cranston that he loved the movie and then started to ask his question. "Wait," Cranston said, "did you like 'Detachment'?" The reporter said again that he loved it, and Cranston seemed surprised.
