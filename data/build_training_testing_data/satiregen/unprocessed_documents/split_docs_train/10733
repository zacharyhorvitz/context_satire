In the aftermath of the shooting in Parkland, Florida last week, some of the student survivors are calling on Congress to pass legislation that would address gun violence in schools. Their public calls raise an interesting question: Will there be a significant shift among the younger generation of today in favor of stricter regulation on guns? It's difficult to answer -- few things in politics are static. It's possible that the Parkland shooting and the efforts of the survivors will drive an uptick in support for gun control among young people and Americans overall.  It's been almost six months since Equifax announced a massive data breach that exposed personal information for as many as 145 million Americans. Cyber thieves could use that data to open up credit cards, take out loans, or carry out a medical theft. But many Americans aren't being proactive to protect their financial well being.
