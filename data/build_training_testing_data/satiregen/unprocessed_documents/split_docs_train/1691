The Furness Railway's prosperity came originally from the export of haematite ore, but the growth of heavy industry at Barrow became a significant contributor. In 1867, The Engineer explained why the demand for Furness haematite had formerly been limited: Edgar Wasser was born in Chicago but moved to Munich with his parents at the age of three. He completed his Abitur at a Waldorf school. He has publicly performed as a rapper since 2007  and has published a series of free EPs and mixtapes online. Bianca Froese-Acquaye, Edgar's widow, has taken up the mantle of continuing the legacy of the group and works closely in a non-musical capacity with the remaining members.
