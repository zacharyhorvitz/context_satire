The Mitt Romney presidential campaign of 2012 officially began on June 2, 2011, when former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney formally announced his candidacy for the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States, at an event in Stratham, New Hampshire. Having previously run in the 2008 Republican primaries, this was Romney's second campaign for the presidency.  “America's Got Talent” host Nick Cannon helped kick the party off this weekend in Washington, D.C. with the Kids’ Inaugural Ball on Saturday alongside pop stars Katy Perry, Usher and the cast of “Glee.” The concert was for the children of military families and schools in the area. It stood in contrast to the lengthy speeches and ceremony of the rest of the weekend. This morning Cannon joins Soledad O’Brien in Washington to discuss the inauguration festivities. Cannon says the inauguration weekend has “been outstanding.”   "One of the most exciting things for me was to be able to host the inaugural ball for the youth as well as the military families," Cannon says.  Among the hundreds of thousands crowding the National Mall on Monday for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama, there will be 26 students from University City High School near St. Louis. The students won an all-expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C., to witness history, and they'll be seated beside U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill. Are you in the crowd for Obama's inauguration?
