On July 19, Manson announced that the band's tenth studio album had the working title SAY10, and predicted a release date of Valentine's Day 2017. In September, Manson confirmed that the band were "putting the finishing touches" on the album, and said: "It's not very much in any way like The Pale Emperor. It's pretty violent in its nature for some reason, and it's not emotional in the same way. It's got a chip on its shoulder. Putesky revived Three Ton Gate shortly afterwards to play live under that name in a 2011 series of dates across America starting in New York City on October 15. He also stated that the second remastered Spooky Kids compilation Deform School would be made available at these dates. In September 1972, Wright decided to disband Wonderwheel and re-form Spooky Tooth. Shortly before doing so, he participated in sessions for Harrison's Living in the Material World (1973), an album that Wright describes as "a beautiful masterpiece" and his favorite Harrison album. Talking to Chris Salewicz of Let It Rock in early 1973, Wright explained his decision to abandon his solo career: "I think my main talent is getting the music together and arranging it. I'm not a showman and so I couldn't be a Cat Stevens out front with just backing musicians, which I was expected to be with Wonderwheel."
