In 1999, Jacobs landed an uncredited voice role as Curt in Full Blast. In the same year, he appeared in his first live-action role in Get the Hell Out of Hamtown. Jablonsky went to the University of California, Berkeley for college. He studied computer science at the beginning, but switched to music composition a year later. After graduation, he became an intern at Hans Zimmer's Remote Control Productions, after cold calling the studio to ask if they needed any help. During that time, Jablonsky met Harry Gregson-Williams, a fellow composer of Zimmer, and started working as his assistant. The story is told from three perspectivesâ€”land (one week of action), sea (one day of action), and air (one hour of action). Nolan structured the film from the point of view of the characters, intending to use visuals rather than dialogue and backstory. He wanted to incorporate the so-called "snowball effect" that he had previously used only in the third acts of his other films. Nolan said that he approached research as though it were for a documentary, and was attracted to the project because of its inversion of the "Hollywood formula": the Battle of Dunkirk was not a victory and did not involve American armed forces, but nevertheless demanded a large-scale production to be put on screen.
