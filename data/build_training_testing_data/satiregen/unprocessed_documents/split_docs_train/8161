Douglas's mother, Lula Pearl, suddenly died at the age of forty-six, 23 days before the title bout. Douglas, who had trained hard, surprised the world by dominating the fight from the beginning, using his 12-inch reach advantage to perfection. He seemingly hit Tyson at will with jabs and right hands and danced out of range of Tyson's own punches. The champion had not taken Douglas seriously, expecting another quick and easy knockout victory. Dave & Buster's is an American restaurant and entertainment business headquartered in Dallas.
