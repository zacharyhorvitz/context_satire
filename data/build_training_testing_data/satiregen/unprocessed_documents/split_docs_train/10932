Culpo became a social media personality after gaining a significant following on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, and has partnered and collaborated with several beauty and fashion brands as an influencer. In August 2017, she opened a restaurant with her family in Rhode Island. Culpo has also appeared in the 2018 and 2019 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, and did advertising for L'Oréal, Kipling, and Uberliss. She also appeared in the reality television show Model Squad (2018). In 2015, Curry wore sneakers that had Deah Shaddy Barakat's name on them (one of the victims of the 2015 Chapel Hill shooting). According to his sister Suzanne, Deah Barakat was known for his "love for basketball and anything Steph Curry." Deah's number for his intramural basketball team at North Carolina State University was Curry's No. 30, and he posed for a photo that was similar to one that Curry did for GQ. Curry is one of the most successful players in the NBA, and he has also become an international celebrity, on par with four-time MVP LeBron James. Like James, he has been considered the  face of the NBA. His flashy play and penchant for coming up big in the clutch have made him a fan favorite, and his smaller physique is said to have made his success seem more attainable for younger fans of the NBA. Curry's jersey was the top seller in the NBA for the 2015–16 and 2016–17 NBA seasons.
