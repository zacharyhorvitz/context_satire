 Sen. Johnny Isakson, who is recovering from back surgery, returned to the Capitol Thursday to cast a key vote to help advance a controversial measure related to Planned Parenthood funding. The 72-year-old Georgia Republican, who also is slowed by Parkinson's disease, came off a Capitol elevator in a wheelchair with Vice President Mike Pence at his side around 11:30 a.m. ET and headed to the floor where the two cast votes on the measure. The vote had been held open for a full hour so Isakson, who had just landed at Reagan National Airport after a flight from Atlanta, could make it.  President Donald Trump, in an effort to sell his health care plan to wary conservatives, is turning to his trio of former House Republicans with what he hopes are influential conservative credentials: Vice President Mike Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Office and Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney. All three trace their political roots back to conservative politics on Capitol Hill, roots that White House officials say Trump administration has found invaluable in trying help usher Trump's first piece of legislation through an unexpectedly difficult Republican-controlled House. Which Republicans are opposing the Obamacare repeal bill? It is unclear, though, what success the three officials have had. After the church service, Trump and his wife went to the White House to meet with President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama. The Obamas greeted the Trumps, and Melania presented the couple with a gift. They then posed for photos in front of the White House press corps. The presentation of a gift was a tradition started by Michelle Obama when she presented George W. Bush and Laura Bush with a gift on the day of her husband's inauguration in 2009.
