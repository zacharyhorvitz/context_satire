The Bangkok Corrections Museum is an incarceration museum in Bangkok, Thailand. It is located on Maha Chai Road  on the site of a former Bangkok maximum security prison built in 1890, during the reign of King Chulalongkorn Rama V. It was planned to follow the Brixton Prison of England. The prison museum was established in 1939 in another prison, the Bang Kwang Central Prison, which had served as a training center for corrections officers and gained the notorious title "Bangkok Hilton" in the way that the Hanoi Hilton did in Vietnam for its brutal prison history. As of 1995 there was one man from the United Kingdom on death row at Bang Kwang, Alan John Davies. He was the first European to receive a death sentence in Thailand. He was freed after 17 years of "hell" in the Bang Kwang prison, returning to the UK in 2007 after being granted amnesty by the king. Facing the death penalty and a transfer to Asia's most notorious prison Bang Kwang Central Prison, also known as Bangkok Hilton, McMillan resolved that this was not going to be the end of him. McMillan later stated, "I had no interest in my trial. I knew what it was going to be like – a farce, a mockery, a sham and a travesty – and that I would receive the death penalty." McMillan escaped from Klong Prem in August 1996, never to be seen in Thailand again.
