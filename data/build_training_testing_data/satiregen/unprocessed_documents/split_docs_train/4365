On 31 March 2005, following a urinary tract infection, he developed septic shock, a form of infection with a high fever and low blood pressure, but was not hospitalised. Instead, he was monitored by a team of consultants at his private residence. This was taken as an indication by the pope, and those close to him, that he was nearing death; it would have been in accordance with his wishes to die in the Vatican. Later that day, Vatican sources announced that John Paul II had been given the Anointing of the Sick by his friend and secretary Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz. John E. Rigali came to Chicago from Italy as a boy and at the age of 16 became an apprentice in the Daprato Statuary Studios, which at that time consisted of a small group of sculptors. He worked his first year for room and board. He slept, ate, and worked in the studio's basement at Van Buren and Clark streets. By night he and the Daprato brothers fashioned the figurines. By day he sold them to the Chicago residents.
