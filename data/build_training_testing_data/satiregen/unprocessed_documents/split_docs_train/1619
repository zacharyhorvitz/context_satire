 Republicans lost dozens of House seats and the majority in that chamber Tuesday, while simultaneously expanding their control of the Senate. At least one factor in those countervailing results is Brett Kavanaugh. While now-Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh, like Trump, was not popular in the country as a whole -- 43% approved of his Supreme Court nomination, according to CNN's national exit polls -- it's also true that majorities of voters in those key states where Democrats lost Senate races said his nomination was a factor in their decision. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday the confirmation process woke up Republican voters.  Trump has taken his job as chief Republican campaigner seriously in 2018, attending more than 80 campaign events, including scores of fundraiser and rallies. Placing the events on map tells the story of his involvement in the midterm. He won't be on the ballot on Tuesday, but his shadow looms large. Here's some of what we can learn: The 2018 battleground is Trump country -- most of Trump's rallies are in states he won in 2016 and where Democrats are defending a Senate seat this year. In October 2018, Breckenridge told a reporter from the Associated Press that he opposed the use of dark money in politics. Breckenridge said that he realistically anticipated only receiving three or four percent of the vote in the general election, and that he endorsed Rosendale's efforts to stop the use of dark money in politics. The Associated Press interpreted Breckenridge's comments as a statement that Breckenridge was dropping out of the race and endorsing Rosendale. Breckenridge later stated that his use of the word "endorse" referred only to stopping the use of dark money in politics, and said he was still running for the Senate.
