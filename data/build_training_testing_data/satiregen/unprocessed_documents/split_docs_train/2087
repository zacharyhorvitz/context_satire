Adele's second studio album 21 was released in January 2011 and held the top position for 24 weeks in the United States. Three of its singles—"Rolling in the Deep", "Someone like You", and "Set Fire to the Rain"—reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The former won three Grammy Awards – Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Short Form Music Video. 21 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. The song was nominated for nine awards at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, including the category Video of the Year, becoming the most nominated video of the night. It is also Swift's second victory for Video of the Year following "Bad Blood" in 2015, joining Beyoncé and Rihanna as the only female acts to win the category twice and the fourth artist overall. It also won Video for Good. The song is nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, becoming her third nomination in the category, following "Shake It Off" (2015) and "Blank Space" (2016). The Grammy Awards are awarded annually by The Recording Academy of the United States for outstanding achievements in the music industry. Often considered the highest music honour, the awards were established in 1958. In 2012, Adele became the second female artist to win six awards in one night. Adele was the second of three artists, preceded by Christopher Cross & followed by Billie Eilish, to have won all four of the general field (Album of the Year, Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year) awards throughout her career.
