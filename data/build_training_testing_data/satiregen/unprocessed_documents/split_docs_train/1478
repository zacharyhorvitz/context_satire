 Twitter has apologized for suspending accounts that were critical of the Chinese government's response to the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4, 1989. Twitter wrote on its public policy feed Saturday that the suspended accounts were swept up in a weekly effort to crack down on "spam and other inauthentic behaviors." "Sometimes our routine actions catch false positives or we make errors. We apologize," Twitter said.  A Chinese state-run newspaper has described the massacre that ended mass pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 as a "vaccination" that protected the country from future "political turmoil." June 4 is the 30th anniversary of the military crackdown that activists say claimed hundreds, if not thousands, of civilian deaths in central Beijing. In an editorial published Monday, nationalistic tabloid Global Times said the government's decision in 1989 had ended "disputes" in the country and helped "all the Chinese people face the future." "Since the incident, China has successfully become the world's second largest economy, with rapid improvement of people's living standards.  Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao's family has deep business ties to China -- placing the key Cabinet official in a potentially conflicting position with the Trump administration's confrontational posture toward the US' major economic rival, according to a report from The New York Times. The Times investigation outlined Chao's ties to Foremost Group, her family's shipping business. The report noted that while Chao "has no formal affiliation or stake" in the company, she and her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have received millions in gifts from Chao's father, who used to run the company, along with political donations from her family. Chao, according to the report, has boosted the company in China, whose government runs a bank that has loan commitments from the shipping company in the order of "hundreds of millions of dollars."
