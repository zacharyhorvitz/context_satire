 Donald Trump and Mike Pence are a study in contrasts when it comes to their debate preparation. As the vice presidential candidates prepare to take the stage for a televised debate this Tuesday, a campaign official said GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence has been preparing for Tuesday's debate since the day the Indiana governor received the call to join the Republican ticket in July. Pence's debate preparations contrast sharply with the much looser sessions used by Trump in the weeks running up to his first face-off with Hillary Clinton. Trump never practiced against a stand-in for Clinton.  Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said Wednesday he apologized to his staff for breaking the "cardinal rule." "I danced in public," the Democrat said during an appearance on CNN's "New Day." The always enthusiastic McAuliffe did a bit of a jig on Tuesday at a rally in Virginia with Tim Kaine, the state's junior US senator and Hillary Clinton's running mate.  Tuesday's Vice Presidential debate was like a bad version of "Waiting for Godot": The questions lacked focus. The conversation meandered. The men spoke past one another. And the moderator intervened in very mysterious ways.
