Troublemaker is, as The Huffington Post puts it, "the first book to reveal the perspective of one of Scientology’s many celebrity members". Remini announced plans for the book soon after splitting from Scientology in 2013, when she told Us magazine that it would "include my experiences, everything that's taboo to talk about". It was published on November 3, 2015 by the Random House imprint Ballantine Books, which described it as "bold, brash, and bravely confessional". "I am a combative, inquisitive, argumentative person, and I will never allow anyone to change that. I still have anger, but I’m okay with that because it fuels me to continue to right any wrongs I may see. And it's because of that and the support of my true friends and family that I was able to fight my way out of Scientology and see the world for the first time." In January 2015, Anonymous released a video and a statement via Twitter condemning the attack on Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people, including eight journalists, were fatally shot. The video, claiming that it is "a message for al-Qaeda, the Islamic State and other terrorists", was uploaded to the group's Belgian account. The announcement stated that "We, Anonymous around the world, have decided to declare war on you, the terrorists" and promises to avenge the killings by "shut down your accounts on all social networks." On January 12, they brought down a website that was suspected to belong to one of these groups.
