 Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley lambasted the Democratic National Committee on Tuesday for holding too few debates and accused the DNC of orchestrating the schedule to "circle the wagons" in support of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland, charged that the DNC was scheduling debates so they would be hidden "behind football games and 'Frosty the Snowman'." A Trump-driven conspiracy to elect Clinton? "The party leaders -- or I should say the party leader -- Debbie Wassermann Schultz is doing a terrible disservice to the public ... we are the Democratic Party, not the undemocratic party," O'Malley said in an interview on MSNBC's "Morning Joe." An August 12, 2007, article described concerns that a Clinton candidacy could lead to a backlash due to fears that she might prove "polarizing." The article states, "A strategist with close ties to leaders in Congress said Democratic Senate candidates in competitive races would be strongly urged to distance themselves from Clinton." According to an online poll, "half of likely voters nationwide said they would never vote for New York Sen. Hillary Clinton."  There's a reason former President Bill Clinton remains one of the most popular and sought-after figures in the Democratic Party. If anyone wants to question how much of an asset he is, look no further than 2012, when he stumped for President Barack Obama and Democratic candidates across the country, and delivered one of the most effective convention speeches most of us have ever heard. Few politicians, including the current GOP frontrunner and businessman Donald Trump, relate to people the way that President Clinton does, and he probably doesn't have an equal when it comes to communicating with them about their concerns. Clinton has always understood that when it comes to politics, it's about the math.
