 Donald Trump is issuing a dire warning to his supporters: You're getting ripped off. "The system, folks, is rigged," Trump told supporters at a rally Monday night in Albany, New York. "It's a rigged, disgusting, dirty system." Trump is coming to grips with the creeping possibility that he could narrowly lose the Republican nomination at a contested GOP convention despite landing in Cleveland with the most delegates.  Donald Trump's senior campaign adviser Paul Manafort huddled Tuesday with a group of House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington, most of whom have officially backed the real estate mogul's presidential bid. The meeting took place in the same building at around the same time Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus was briefing rank-and-file House GOP members on the rules for the party's nominating process. Joe Kasper, chief of staff to California Rep. Duncan Hunter, told CNN he secured the "New York Room," for the sit-down with Manafort, noting the "symbolism" since Trump's home state of New York holds its primary on Tuesday, and the billionaire businessman is favored to win.

John Kasich is set to lobby Republican Party leaders when they meet in Florida next week as his team continues its behind-the-scenes push to get him nominated at the Republican convention in Cleveland in July. Kasich will meet with the leaders in Hollywood Wednesday evening at an event hosted by Ohio's members of the Republican National Committee, according to an email invitation that was sent to RNC members. A copy of the invitation was obtained by CNN on Thursday.
