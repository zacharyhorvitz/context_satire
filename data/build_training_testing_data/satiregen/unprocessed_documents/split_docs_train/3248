The movie starts with Nicole Lauker saying good-bye to her husband as he and his friend leave to go fishing for three days. As the night comes, the doorbell rings and Nicole answers. It is the police, who inform Nicole that the boat has been crashed by a bomb and Evan (her husband) is dead. They believe the death was contrived and suspect that Evan was possibly dealing with illegal substances. As she is searching for the money, she finds an envelope to an address in Detroit. To throw the FBI off her trail, Nicole goes to her friend's house and convinces her to dress like her, leave and drive Nicole's car to Washington, D.C. so the suspicious FBI will follow her friend while Nicole goes to find the man at the address. Nicole is shocked to learn that the man at the address died recently in a fire. The wife, a stripper named Zoe, invites Nicole in. Many leads were followed that appeared to match the circumstances of the case. A woman who had been seen throwing a garbage bag over a bridge was later questioned by police, but the contents of the bag were found to be simply spoiled fruit. Other individuals stated they had seen toddlers resembling the Jane Doe, one at a store and another at a playground, with a woman clothed in a burqa. Investigators were unable to find any trace of the girl at the store through information gathered by security cameras, and the subject at the playground has yet to be located.
