Following the luncheon, Trump, Pence, and their wives reviewed an honor guard of troops at the East Front of the U.S. Capitol before beginning the parade. The inaugural parade route ran along Pennsylvania Avenue, NW from the U.S. Capitol, ending at the north face of the White House. During most of the parade, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled in the armored limousine used by the president because of potential security threats. The president and first lady exited their limousine twice, walking on Pennsylvania Avenue for portions of the parade, a longstanding custom. The Kalahari is home to many migratory birds and animals. Previously havens for wild animals from elephants to giraffes, and for predators such as lions and cheetahs, the riverbeds are now mostly grazing spots, though leopards and cheetahs can still be found. The area is now heavily grazed and cattle fences restrict the movement of wildlife. Among deserts of the Southern Hemisphere, the Kalahari most closely resembles some Australian deserts in its latitude and its mode of formation.  Melania Trump stepped off Executive One, the government plane assigned for her travel, Tuesday and arrived in Ghana on her first major solo journey as first lady. The schedule for Trump's trip has her spending about a week abroad, zig-zagging the continent to Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt. Greeted on a tarmac red carpet by Ghana's first lady, Rebecca Akufo-Addo, Trump was presented with a bouquet of flowers wrapped in colorful kente cloth and treated to drum and dancing performances. She spent Tuesday morning visiting Ridge Hospital, where she greeted mothers and babies and passed out teddy bears and blankets.
