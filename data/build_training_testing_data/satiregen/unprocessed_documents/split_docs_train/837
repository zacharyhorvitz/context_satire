Andrew (Andy) Blunt is a Missouri political consultant and founder of state-based consulting firm Statehouse Strategies LLC. He is the son of Missouri Senator Roy Blunt and the brother of former Missouri Governor Matt Blunt. The Missouri Times named Andy Blunt one of the 100+ people to know in Missouri politics for the previous four years, stating, “If this list was the 5+ , Andy Blunt would still be on it.” Blunt's extensive client list has been credited by some to his diverse range of experiences and relationships at the Missouri state capital, while others assert that his clients are attracted to the influence he has on his father. Blunt is a state lobbyist and does not lobby the federal government. Blunt withdrew from society and seldom went out after his exposure. His friend Tess Rothschild suggested that he occupy his time writing his memoirs. Brian Sewell, his former pupil, said they remained unfinished because he had to consult the newspaper library in Colindale, North London, to check facts but was unhappy at being recognised. McCaskill was the first elected woman to represent Missouri in the U.S. Senate. Jean Carnahan was appointed to the Senate following her husband's death and posthumous election, but was defeated in a close election by Jim Talent. In 2006, McCaskill defeated Talent for a full term. In 2011, she became Missouri's senior Senator when Roy Blunt took office as the junior Senator.
