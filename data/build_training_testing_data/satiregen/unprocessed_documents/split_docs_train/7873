 A majority of Americans say the tone and civility in political debate has been worsening in recent years, according to a new poll released Monday. The CBS News poll, taken after last week's shooting at a GOP Congressional Baseball Game practice in Alexandria, found 68% of Americans believe tone and civility in politics are getting worse. Additionally, nearly three-quarters believe that the worsening tone is encouraging violence -- like last week's shooting. That number is also fairly consistent across party lines, with 68% of Republicans and 85% of Democrats believing so. Among the public, his reputation has improved somewhat since his presidency ended in 2009. In February 2012, Gallup reported that "Americans still rate George W. Bush among the worst presidents, though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office." Gallup had earlier noted that Bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office, from 40 percent in January 2009 and 35 percent in March 2009, to 45 percent in July 2010, a period during which he had remained largely out of the news. Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement  in Bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency.  President Donald Trump's job approval rating has dropped to 36% due to Americans' negative reaction to his handling of the Russia investigations, a new CBS News poll has found. When CBS last polled Trump's job approval rating in late April, his approval rating was 41%. The drop is partially due to his dwindling support among Republicans. In the poll released Tuesday, a third of Americans say Trump's approach to the Russia investigation has worsened their opinion of him.
