 Fires are raging at a record rate in Brazil's Amazon rainforest, and scientists warn that it could strike a devastating blow to the fight against climate change. The fires are burning at the highest rate since the country's space research center, the National Institute for Space Research (known by the abbreviation INPE), began tracking them in 2013, the center said Tuesday. There have been 72,843 fires in Brazil this year, with more than half in the Amazon region, INPE said. That's more than an 80% increase compared with the same period last year.  The Amazon is burning -- and humans are likely to blame. Environmental organizations and researchers say the wildfires blazing in the Brazilian rainforest were set by cattle ranchers and loggers who want to clear and utilize the land, emboldened by the country's pro-business president. "The vast majority of these fires are human-lit," said Christian Poirier, the program director of non-profit organization Amazon Watch. He added that even during dry seasons, the Amazon -- a humid rainforest -- doesn't catch on fire easily, unlike the dry bushland in California or Australia.  Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro plans to deploy the army to tackle the wildfires raging in the Amazon rainforest. The troops will be deployed starting Saturday for the next month, according to a presidential decree obtained by CNN. "The Amazon rainforest is an essential part of our history, our territory and everything that makes us feel," Bolsonaro said during a speech Friday. "Being Brazilian, our wealth is invaluable both in terms of biodiversity and natural resources."
