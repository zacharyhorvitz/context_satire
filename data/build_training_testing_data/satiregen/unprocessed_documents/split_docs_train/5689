On September 9, 2015, the channel announced a phased overhaul of its programming schedule during 2016, in which the channel would gradually shift its focus back towards a forecast-based lineup; the channel cancelled Wake Up with Al (citing high production costs as it was produced in New York city rather than Atlanta) and announced that AMHQ would be reformatted as a weather-focused program (eliminating lifestyle segments), with Stephanie Abrams taking over as host while original host Sam Champion would become a contributor for its prime time schedule starting November 2. The network also announced it would no longer greenlight original long-form programming, and expand live forecast programming on its schedule throughout 2016 once all remaining long-form programs already in development conclude their runs. In a memo sent out to network staff by Weather Company CEO David Kenny, it cited the refocusing towards weather-based programs was done on the basis that "our most passionate fans come to us for the weather and the science behind the weather, not our original shows." Around 50 TWC employees – including production, engineering, and financial staff – were laid off, and the television channel's budget was reduced to focus investments on the company's Internet and mobile properties. On September 9, 2015, the channel announced a major phased overhaul of its programming schedule – which involves a gradual return to a forecast-based lineup – beginning with the announcement of a format revamp of AMHQ, with the program's host Sam Champion being moved to prime time on November 2 in an undefined role, while Stephanie Abrams would co-host AMHQ (as a result of the cancellation of Wake Up with Al, on which Abrams had been a co-host, The Weather Channel also announced that it would cease production from its New York City studio at Rockefeller Center due to the prohibitive rental costs). The network also announced plans to stop greenlighting original long-form programming, and expand live forecast programming on its schedule during 2016 once all remaining long-form programs already in development conclude their runs. In a memo sent out to network staff by Weather Company CEO David Kenny, it cited the refocusing towards weather-based programs was done on the basis that "our most passionate fans come to us for the weather and the science behind the weather, not our original shows." In 1982, the Turner Broadcasting System (which would merge with Time Warner in 1996) created a spin-off of CNN called CNN2, which was originally formatted to show the top news stories of the day on a 30-minute "wheel" schedule. The channel rebranded as CNN Headline News in 1983, before the network abandoned the CNN branding and changed its name to the orphaned initialism HLN in 2008, following a shift from news programming towards a mix of news during the day and discussion programs and documentary series at night that began two years earlier.
