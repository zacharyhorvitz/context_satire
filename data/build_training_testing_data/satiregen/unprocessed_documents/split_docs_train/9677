The International Olympic Committee (IOC) uses three-letter abbreviation country codes to refer to each group of athletes that participate in the Olympic Games. Each geocode usually identifies a National Olympic Committee (NOC), but there are several codes that have been used for other instances in past Games, such as teams composed of athletes from multiple nations, or groups of athletes not formally representing any nation. The Macau Sports and Olympic Committee was founded in 1987 and has attempted to enroll to the IOC since its foundation, but is still not officially recognized and thus no athlete has participated in the Olympic Games under the name "Macau, China". It has, however, participated in the Paralympic Games. Haiti competed at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. The country's delegation consisted of two officials and eleven competitors. Of the competitors, four were track and field athletes, and seven were shooters. One of the athletes and two of the shooters ended up not competing in any events.
