Metacritic gave the first season of the show a score of 44 out of 100 based on 33 critics' reviews. Linda Stasi of the New York Post called the series "not so bad", adding "Anger Management is pretty conventional up to and including an idiot laugh track—and a character named Charlie—again. But maybe the familiar is what will keep crazy Charlie  from killing himself and others in a blind, drunken, psycho haze on set. Or maybe not." Variety gave a negative review of the episode, saying: "Diving into the business side of the show so relentlessly felt seriously misguided — and more than a little defensive", and that "while the sendoff addressed a certain kind of 'Winning', in the grand pantheon of series finales this wasn't even close to serving up a winner. Corey Barker of TV.Com gave the episode a positive review. He thought "it was a legitimately funny episode of television that toyed with viewers' expectations all the way up until the last millisecond", as to whether or not Charlie Sheen would appear, which is what the episode was teasingly building up to. He argued that "it sure was fascinating. And for Two and a Half Men, that's a very fitting way to go out".
