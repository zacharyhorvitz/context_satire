The Iowa Caucuses are the kickoff for the national presidential selection process. Iowa holds a powerful position in that process because it can serve as a sounding board for the strength of a candidate's campaign. A win in the Iowa Caucuses can validate a candidate or propel them from relative obscurity. In particular the Iowa Republican Caucuses hold the most power when either the GOP is not the party in the presidency or an incumbent is not on the ballot.  Hillary Clinton and her Democratic rivals are coming soon to Iowa's famed Surf Ballroom. Four Democratic presidential candidates are set to appear together on the same stage next month in Clear Lake, Iowa, inside the iconic music hall where Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper played their final show in 1959 before dying in a plane crash nearby. The Surf Ballroom is a frequent stop on the campaign trail for presidential candidates of both parties. The Democratic hopefuls, including Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley and Lincoln Chafee, will join Clinton on Aug. 14, organizers told CNN. During the 2012 Republican primaries the Republican Party of Iowa partnered with various news organizations such as Fox News to bring a series of debates that were nationally televised, but directed toward voters in Iowa. This national attention is a potential political boon for a small Midwestern state and attracts attention politically to a state that may otherwise not receive such attention. The caucuses also give power to the party members in the electorate. In this the average GOP voter in Iowa can set the tone for the entire primary campaign, which gives local voters tremendous control over who the next President will be.
