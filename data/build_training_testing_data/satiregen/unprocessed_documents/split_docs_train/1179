 President Donald Trump told top Democrats on Tuesday that Mexico would be paying for his southern border wall, thanks to his recently signed United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement, according to a recounting of the meeting by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The claim resurrects a popular theme from his 2016 campaign that has yet to materialize in substance -- Mexican leadership has long denied it would pay for a wall. A Mexican official familiar with the issue told CNN on Tuesday, "MexicoÂ´s position regarding the so-called wall is the same the previous government had. Mexico WILL NOT pay for it, no matter how you spin it."  US President Donald Trump and Mexico's top immigration officials painted sharply different pictures Tuesday of the large groups of Central American migrants at the border.

Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, unlocking the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcing border security, and beginning the planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.
