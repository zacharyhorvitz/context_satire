 Ted Cruz formally named Carly Fiorina as his vice presidential running mate Wednesday -- a last-ditch move to regain momentum after being mathematically eliminated from winning the GOP presidential nomination outright. "After a great deal of consideration and prayer, I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated to be president of the United States that I will run on a ticket with my vice presidential nominee Carly Fiorina," Cruz said during a rally in Indianapolis. Fiorina joined the Texas senator on stage, and Cruz's staff changed the podium in between Cruz and Fiorina's remarks to display a new logo featuring both their names. "Ted could not be more right in what he said: There is a lot at stake, and in fact, this is a fight, this is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our nation," Fiorina said.  On Wednesday, Ted Cruz announced that former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, who dropped out of the presidential race in February, would be his running mate. At first I was perplexed. Cruz isn't the nominee. It's looking increasingly unlikely that he will be, and people who aren't nominees don't need running mates.  Ted Cruz's new running mate, Carly Fiorina, said Thursday that Donald Trump can't declare victory until he's crossed the goal line for the Republican nomination. "If the Steelers are on the five-yard line it's close, but it's not a touchdown. So Donald Trump can get close, but it's not a touchdown until you have 1,237 delegates," Fiorina told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day." Fiorina also defended the Republican nominating process, despite polling showing that an overwhelming number of voters in Tuesday's contests feel the candidate with the most delegates heading into the Cleveland convention should get the nomination, even if they don't get to 1,237 needed to secure the nomination.
