In the episode, Fielder attempts to help a struggling coffee shop by renaming it Dumb Starbucks, a parody of the American coffee company and coffeehouse chain. While producing the episode, the actual Dumb Starbucks location provoked real international media coverage. This episode was the second time Nathan for You was the subject of serious coverage from mainstream media outlets, the first being for a video produced for the season one episode "Santa/Petting Zoo". The location attracted dozens of visitors before it was allegedly shut down by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS), an event incorporated into the episode, although the LACDHS has no records of an action against Dumb Starbucks. On April 12, 2018, two African-American men, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, were arrested in a Starbucks store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A witness at the time of the arrests said that the men asked the staff if they could use the bathroom to which an employee said it was reserved for paying customers. The men waited at a table for another person to join them, without ordering, and were instructed by the staff to either make a purchase or leave. When they didn't comply, the store manager called the police, saying the men were trespassing, which led to the arrests. When tensions with Zacklin arise, he decides to pursue Dumb Starbucks on his own, kicking Zacklin off the project. Renting a vacant retail space in nearby Los Feliz, they begin to construct the shop over the course of a week. Fielder posts a Craigslist ad seeking baristas with Starbucks experience, and hires two applicants. Dumb Starbucks opens to little fanfare, leading Fielder to promote the store in the parking lot of a local Starbucks.
