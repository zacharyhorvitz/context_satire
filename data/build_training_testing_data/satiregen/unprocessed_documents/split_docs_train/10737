Death row is a place in a prison that houses inmates awaiting execution after being convicted of a capital crime. The term is also used figuratively to describe the state of awaiting execution ("being on death row"), even in places where no special facility or separate unit for condemned inmates exists. In the United States, after a person is found guilty of a capital offense in death penalty states, the judge will give the jury the option of imposing a death sentence or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. It is then up to a jury to decide whether to give the death sentence; this usually has to be a unanimous decision. The Southern Ohio Correctional Facility is where condemned Ohio prisoners are executed; however, prisoners awaiting execution are not housed there on a long term basis. Since the riots, the men's death row has been relocated three times. The first relocation was to the Mansfield Correctional Institution in Mansfield with the majority of inmates being moved later to the Ohio State Penitentiary, a supermax facility in Youngstown while a few remained at Mansfield. Currently, all but twelve condemned inmates are housed in a new death row unit at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution in Chillicothe. The majority of male death row inmates are held at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution, while some that are considered a high security risk are held at the Ohio State Penitentiary and those with serious medical conditions are held at the Franklin Medical Center. Death row had been scheduled to move from Chillicothe Correctional Institution to Toledo Correctional Institution in the summer of 2017, however those plans were delayed and ultimately  cancelled in 2018 and death row remains at Chillicothe. Female death row inmates are housed in the Ohio Reformatory for Women. Executions occur at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility.
