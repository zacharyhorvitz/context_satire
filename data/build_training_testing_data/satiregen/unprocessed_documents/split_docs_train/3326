 Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have agreed to add four more debates, including one this Thursday in New Hampshire just days before that state's primary. The decision expands the total number of Democratic debates from six to ten, and suggests both campaigns are prepared for a drawn-out primary battle that will extend at least until May. The first additional debate will take place in New Hampshire on Thursday. The campaigns have also agreed to a March debate in Flint, Michigan, and two more debates in April and May.  Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton went at it on a debate stage for the first time since the New Hampshire primary. The remaining two Democratic presidential candidates squared off on a range of issues, including race, immigration and how to defend President Obama's legacy during a debate moderated by PBS in Milwaukee and simulcast on CNN ahead of a looming caucus in Nevada and a primary in South Carolina. Here are the greatest moments of the night captured in GIFs. When Hillary Clinton was asked whether she agreed with former Secretary of State Madeline Albright's statement that "there's a special place in Hell" for women who don't help each other.  CNN is going to simulcast the Democratic presidential primary debate that PBS is holding next week in Wisconsin. "PBS NewsHour" co-anchors Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff will moderate the debate on February 11 at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. PBS announced the simulcasting arrangement with CNN on Thursday. By showing the debate on cable news, CNN is sure to expand the audience for the face-off between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.
