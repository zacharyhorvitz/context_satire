But in Season 13, Episode 1, after Alex beats up Andrew, Maggie says that she will call his parents because they “know her,” and then reveals to Meredith that DeLuca's mom never knew that Andrew and Maggie broke up, which is inconsistent with the storyline that is later told. When Meredith and DeLuca start a potential relationship in Season 15, Andrew says that Carina didn't tell him his mother had died until after she died, which doesn't fit with the storyline in the beginning of Season 13, which implies DeLuca's parents are alive and together. Later in Season 15, they add the story of DeLuca's father's potential mental illness. Despite initial skepticism, the character has been received positively. Rebecca Farley of Refinery29 described DeLuca's reputation as "passionate, handsome, and a bit of an idiot." She also cited the fact that the intern had remained on the show after multiple seasons as proof that the "Rhimesian jury" had ruled in his favor, affirming the character's likability. Elite Daily's Rachel Chapman called the character "charming" and said that "he truly handles stuff like a pro." The announcement of Gianniotti's casting and the character's introduction initially received backlash from some fans who felt that the character was meant to be a replacement for Derek Shepherd, a character that had recently been written off the series to accommodate the departure of actor Patrick Dempsey. However, Gianniotti denied that that this was the case, saying, "I’m just a new character on the show. I’m not filling any void." He also confirmed at the time that "Andrew won’t have any  intentions with Meredith  so fans don’t have to worry about any threat."
