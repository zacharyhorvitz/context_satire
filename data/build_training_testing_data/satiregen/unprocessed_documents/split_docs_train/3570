Becoming is the memoir of former United States first lady Michelle Obama published in 2018. Described by the author as a deeply personal experience, the book talks about her roots and how she found her voice, as well as her time in the White House, her public health campaign, and her role as a mother. The book is published by Crown and will be released in 24 languages. One million copies will be donated to First Book, an American nonprofit organization which provides books to children.  Not only is Alexa listening when you speak to an Echo smart speaker, an Amazon employee is potentially listening, too. Amazon employs a global team that transcribes the voice commands captured after the wake word is detected and feeds them back into the software to help improve Alexa's grasp of human speech so it can respond more efficiently in the future, Bloomberg reports. Amazon reportedly employs thousands of full-time workers and contractors in several countries, including the United States, Costa Rica and Romania, to listen to as many as 1,000 audio clips in shifts that last up to nine hours. The audio clips they listen to were described as "mundane" and even sometimes "possibly criminal," including listening to a potential sexual assault.  Amazon employees are putting pressure on the company to rethink how it contributes to the battle against global warming. In a Medium post Wednesday published by a group called Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, more than 3,500 staffers urged CEO Jeff Bezos to publicly outline the company's plans to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels. The letter follows two meetings between Amazon leadership and employees that delivered little clarity on the company's efforts, Rajit Iftikhar, an Amazon software engineer who co-signed the letter, confirmed to CNN Business. The employees, who list their names and titles at the bottom of the letter, said Amazon's "sustainability goals lack context."
