 Patients whose fungal tests are negative may still be at risk in a meningitis outbreak, as the fungus involved can be difficult to detect, federal health officials said Thursday. Cases of the non-contagious fungal meningitis rose to 170 in 11 states as of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Fourteen people have died. The cases have been linked to injections of contaminated steroid injection made by the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center.  Authorities in Riverside County, California, said Tuesday that a ground squirrel has tested positive for exposure to fleas infected with the bacteria that can cause plague. It's the country's first positive test in more than a decade, according to Dottie Merki, environmental health program chief at the Riverside County Department of Environmental Health. "It's not something that people should panic about, but we do want them to be educated so they can protect their families and their pets," she said. The squirrel was picked up in early September at a campground north of Idyllwild, located in the San Jacinto Mountains in southern California.

They are being used again, this time to build the case to destroy something that has transported millions of people of color to a more equitable life in America: affirmative action.
