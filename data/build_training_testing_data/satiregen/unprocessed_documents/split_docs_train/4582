 In the midst of intense national gun debate, lawmakers in Pennsylvania proposed a tougher gun law -- but only for the city of Philadelphia. New legislation calls for a two-year minimum sentence for any illegal firearm possession in the city, bumping the current misdemeanor charge up to a felony. State Sen. Larry Farnese of Philadelphia, a Democrat, and Rep. John Taylor of Philadelphia, a Republican, joined with local officials to announce the proposal in hopes of decreasing violence in the city. In a news release issued Thursday, the day the legislation was introduced, Farnese said that "it gives Philadelphia's law enforcement community an important new tool that will help curb gun violence and keep illegal weapons out of the hands of criminals."  Two Catholic priests accused of wrongdoing have been declared unfit for service by the Philadelphia archdiocese and will no longer be allowed to minister. Joseph J. Gallagher,  78, and Mark S. Gaspar, 43, are two of the 26 priests who were suspended by the archdiocese after a 2011 grand jury investigation into the archdiocese's handling of child sex abuse allegations. They were placed on administrative leave while the church looked into allegations of abuse and misconduct. Archbishop Charles J. Chaput said the investigations of Gallagher and Gaspar found substantiated violations of the "Standards of Ministerial Behavior and Boundaries," an archdiocese guide for behavior, including interaction with children and youths.  The National Football League attempted on Tuesday to dismiss more than 200 cases brought by nearly 4,200 retired players who said they were not warned of the dangers of head trauma. U.S. District Court Judge Anita Brody delayed a ruling on the request. "I will rule when I sort this out for myself," she said before adjourning the packed courtroom. The class-action lawsuit could determine the league's role in caring for players with football-related neurodegenerative diseases.
