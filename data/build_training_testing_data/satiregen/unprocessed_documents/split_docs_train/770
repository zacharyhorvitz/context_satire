Six Flags Magic Mountain, originally Magic Mountain, is a 262-acre (106 ha) theme park located in the Valencia neighborhood of Santa Clarita, California, 35 miles (56 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. It opened on May 30, 1971, as a development of the Newhall Land and Farming Company. In 1979, Six Flags purchased the park and added the name "Six Flags" to the park's name. With 19 roller coasters, Six Flags Magic Mountain holds the world record for most roller coasters in an amusement park. Norville began her television career while still a college student. She received an internship through Georgia Public Television, where she worked on The Lawmakers, a nightly program covering the Georgia General Assembly. She was spotted by an executive of WAGA-TV in Atlanta, who offered her a summer internship. As Norville recalled, “The third day they were short on reporters and they asked me to cover a news story.” She reported that evening on the six o’clock news and was later offered a weekend reporting position during her senior year in college. The people of Israel had been oppressed by Jabin, the king of Canaan, whose capital was Hazor, for twenty years. Stirred by the wretched condition of Israel she sends a message to Barak, the son of Abinoam, at Kedesh of Naphtali, and tells him that the Lord God had commanded him to muster ten thousand troops of Naphtali and Zebulun and concentrate them upon Mount Tabor, the mountain at the northern angle of the great plain of Esdraelon. At the same time she states that the Lord God of Israel will draw Sisera, commander of Jabin's army, to the River Kishon. Barak declines to go without the prophet.
