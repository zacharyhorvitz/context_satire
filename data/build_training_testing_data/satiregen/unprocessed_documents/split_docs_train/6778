In the United States some working dog breed organisations, such as the American Border Collie Association and the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America, have put a considerable amount of effort in the fight to keep their breeds from being recognised by the AKC and some other kennel clubs, as they fear that introduction of their breeds to the show ring will lead to decreasing numbers of working dogs with adequate qualities. Jock was entered in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1911 at the age of 3 years old, and was successful, becoming the first Scottish Terrier to win best-in-show and the first non-Smooth Fox Terrier to win. More than 2,000 dogs were entered at the event and Jock's appearance was criticized by other exhibitors, being described as "lacking the qualities of a typical Scottish Terrier". The reserve was another importation from the United Kingdom, an Airedale Terrier named Prince of York. Following the victory, his owner Mr. Albright said that nothing less than $5,000 would cause him to part with his champion. When bull-baiting became popular in England due to the shortage of bears, bull-baiters soon realized that large fighting dogs were built too heavy and too slow for this type of combat. When fighting a bull, dogs were trained to grab onto the bull's nose and pin the bull's head to the ground. If the dog failed to do this, the bull would fling the dog out of the ring with its horns. The British therefore decided to selectively breed fighting dogs for shorter legs and a more powerful jaw.
