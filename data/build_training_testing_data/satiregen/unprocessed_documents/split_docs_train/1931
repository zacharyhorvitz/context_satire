In its first three years, the CFI completed more than 100 innovation projects within the Mayo system, ranging from redesigning Mayo's traditional clinical exam room; to streamlining job descriptions and protocols in a dermatology clinic; to analyzing how hospital care teams hand off patients from one team to another; to supporting a project with a “stroke robot” that enables Mayo physicians to consult with patients from a remote location within seconds of the first possible signs of a stroke. Impressed by the medical treatment received by members of Jacksonville's Davis family (then owners of the Winn-Dixie supermarket chain) at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, they rallied community and corporate support to bring the Mayo Clinic to Jacksonville and donated the large tract of land off San Pablo Road on which Mayo opened an outpatient consultation center in 1986. This was the first time the Mayo Clinic established a location outside of Rochester, Minnesota. With an initial complement of 35 physicians and 145 support personnel, it grew to approximately 5,500 total staff over the following 30 years. This led to the creation of the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) in 1915. MFMER was established as a department of the University of Minnesota with a $1.5 million donation to offer graduate programs at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. During the same time period, the Mayo brothers created the Mayo Properties Association which converted the Mayo Clinic into a non-profit association practice. Mayo Properties Association later became the Mayo Foundation.
