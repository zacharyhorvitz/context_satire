The hospital opened on July 3, 1891 as the Emergency Accident Hospital. It was founded by Dr. George W. Galvin, who served as the hospital's superintendent and chief surgeon. It was the first emergency hospital in the United States. Gavin opened the hospital in an annex of the United States Hotel at 144 Kingston Street. This trend, however, has been reversed since then, with the rate of hospitalization falling by more than 10% and the number of US hospitals shrinking from 6,933 in 1981 to 5,534 in 2016. Among the reasons for this are the increasing availability of more complex care elsewhere such as at home or at the physicians' offices and also the less therapeutic and more life-threatening image of the hospitals in the eyes of the public. Floating Hospital for Children began as a hospital ship sailing the Boston Harbor for the first time in 1894. For a time, the boat was also used for parties on Boston harbor, with the leisure cruise ending at midnight and hospital services opening at 8am. Heralded as a major innovation in pediatric medicine, the mission of the hospital ship was to take ill urban children out onto the harbor to experience the healing qualities of fresh sea air and sunshine. By the end of the first summer, 1,100 children were treated.
