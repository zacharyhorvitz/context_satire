Rick Alan Ross, an anti-cultist and deprogrammer, referred to the murder trial of Scott Peterson, in which the defense made the claim that the killings were by a "Satanic cult" rather than the defendant. Ross called this a ridiculous manifestation of the Satanic panic, referred to it as a "Hail Satan Pass", similar to the Hail Mary pass in football, a desperate and unlikely attempt. LaVey is thought to be directly responsible for the genesis of Satanism as a serious religious movement. Scholars agree that there is no reliably documented case of Satanic continuity prior to the founding of the Church of Satan. It was the first organized church in modern times to be devoted to the figure of Satan, and according to Faxneld and Petersen, the Church represented "the first public, highly visible, and long-lasting organization which propounded a coherent satanic discourse". The ubiquity of the phrase has led to it being used in parodic imitation of evangelism, as with the Mr. Show with Bob and David sketch "Hail Satan Network" which includes characters who are Satanic televangelists. It received another humorous use when The Simpsons character Bart Simpson was punished for using it to end the Pledge of Allegiance in the episode "Burns' Heir".
