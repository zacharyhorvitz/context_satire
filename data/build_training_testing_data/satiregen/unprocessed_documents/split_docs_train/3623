David takes Emily out for a nice dinner together, then walks her to her door to say goodnight. They are interrupted by Jessica, who is babysitting again. Emily tries to introduce David as just a co-worker who took her out for dinner after work but Jessica sees right through it. Emily asks how much she owes Jessica for babysitting and in response Jessica shares with Emily how Robbie and Molly are the only two kids she's ever babysat that always stay up until their dad gets home. At Robbie's eighth-grade graduation, Robbie is the salutatorian and begins to give a pessimistic speech about how he no longer believes in true love and soulmates. Cal stops him and instead begins to recount his courtship with Emily to the audience, saying that, while he does not know if things will work out, he will never give up on Emily. With renewed faith, Robbie reaffirms his love for Jessica, to the audience's applause. After the ceremony, Cal gives Jacob and Hannah his blessing. The group's first test came in 1935, when it ordered Dutch Schultz to drop his plans to murder Special Prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey. Luciano argued that a Dewey assassination would precipitate a massive law enforcement crackdown. An enraged Schultz said he would kill Dewey anyway and walked out of the meeting. Murder, Inc leader Albert Anastasia approached Luciano with information that Schultz had asked him to stake out Dewey's apartment building on Fifth Avenue.
