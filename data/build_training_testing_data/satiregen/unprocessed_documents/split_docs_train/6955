 John Hickenlooper is shaking up his campaign, multiple sources tell CNN, allowing his campaign manager, finance director and spokeswoman to leave as the former Colorado governor fails to gain traction in the expansive Democratic presidential primary field. Hickenlooper is not on the cusp of dropping out of the race, a senior Democrat who spoke to the governor Monday night tells CNN. He has not sugarcoated things to his staff and has acknowledged how hard it has been to break through, the Democrat said, but he has no plans to leave before the debate later this month in Detroit. "He's staying in," the senior Democrat said, adding that Hickenlooper will reassess after the debate. On March 4, 2019, Hickenlooper announced his campaign to seek the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in 2020. His candidacy had been a matter of media speculation for months before his announcement. Hickenlooper formally launched his campaign on March 7, 2019, in Denver, Colorado. A video titled "Stand Tall" was released to announce the campaign and outline his reasons for running.  A group of senior aides to John Hickenlooper's presidential campaign urged the former Colorado governor to end his bid for the Democratic nomination and run for Senate last month, multiple sources familiar with the discussion tell CNN. The meeting happened shortly after the Democratic National Committee announced in May that it was increasing the qualification thresholds for the September and October primary debates. A key pressure point was the fact that Hickenlooper only has 13,000 unique donors, the sources said, making it nearly impossible for him to reach the 130,000-donor threshold needed to qualify for the third and fourth debates. One source added that Hickenlooper's campaign raised just over $1 million in the second quarter of 2019 and could run out of money soon if no changes are made or if they governor's candidacy doesn't take off.
