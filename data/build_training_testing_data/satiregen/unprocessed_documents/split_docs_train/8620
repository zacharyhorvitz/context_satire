Musically, "All About Tonight" is a dance-pop and electropop song with elements of Hi-NRG. Lott herself described the song as "a party track about going out with the girls and forgetting about past dramas and relationships so that you can have fun and let your hair down." Lott explained the song to BBC News: "I always prefer to write songs about emotional situations and heartbreak  because I like getting into the character. When we were writing 'Cry Me Out', I said, 'I feel like singing about something sad but, obviously, still being strong'. So the guy has to cry to get over me, instead of the other way around." She also told Digital Spy that the song's opening lyric "I got your e-mails, you just don't get females" was her favourite line on the Turn It Up album. "All About Tonight" was written during a studio meeting between Lott, Canadian singer-songwriter Tebey and producer Brian Kidd at the ole Pop/Urban Songcamp in Los Angeles. Tebey had started working with a new manager, Ed Jefferson, who introduced with to Kidd. When the two got together, Tebey had the track done and his job was to write the top line. "I wrote the verse and started on the chorus, but I wasn't really loving it; I didn't think it was as strong as it should be.
