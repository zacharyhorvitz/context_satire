 One day in and Jeb Bush has already broken his Lenten promise. The devout Catholic, who campaigned Wednesday in South Carolina with ash on his forehead for Ash Wednesday -- the first day of Lent -- told reporters Thursday night that he was giving up profanity for the 40-day Christian season of sacrifice "to set an example for other candidates in the race." Participants in Lent, followed by several Christian denominations including Catholicism, often choose a vice or negative habit to give up for the duration Lenten season, which ends on Easter. With Donald Trump making headlines for his use of sometimes-vulgar language, Bush has been hitting the GOP front-runner recently for his unusual choice of words on the campaign trail.  Former President George W. Bush will hit the campaign trail for the first time in years when he appears at a South Carolina campaign rally with his younger brother next week, Jeb Bush's campaign announced. The 43rd President is considered popular among Republican voters in the state, especially with the high percentage of active duty military and veterans there. The Bush campaign hopes that will help build grassroots support with the Republican primary five days later. "President Bush has been incredibly supportive of his brother's campaign and Governor Bush is excited to have him out on the trail," the campaign said in a statement announcing the rally, which will be held Monday evening in North Charleston.  Donald Trump returned to mocking Jeb Bush after the two clashed during ABC's Republican presidential debate on Saturday night, calling him a "loser" and saying "every time he attacks me he melts like butter." Appearing on "CBS This Morning" on Monday, Trump was dismissive of the contentious exchanges with Bush during the debate, and of Bush himself. "You look at Jeb -- Jeb's a loser," Trump said. "He's spent $110 million so far, he's at the bottom of the pack or toward the bottom of the pack.
