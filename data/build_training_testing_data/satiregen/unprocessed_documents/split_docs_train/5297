 House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters at a manufacturing event in Wisconsin Monday he had "nothing to add" about the indictments against former campaign aides to Donald Trump, adding, "I haven't even read the indictments." "It is big news, but this is what you get from a special counsel," he added after being pressed by a reporter at an event in Darien, Wisconsin. "They made an indictment. I really have nothing to add because I haven't even read it, so I'm not going to speculate on something I haven't read." Ryan confirmed on October 22, that he would seek the speakership after receiving the endorsements of two factions of House Republicans, including the conservative Freedom Caucus. Ryan, upon confirming his bid for the speakership, stated, "I never thought I'd be speaker. But I pledged to you that if I could be a unifying figure, then I would serve â€“ I would go all in. After talking with so many of you, and hearing your words of encouragement, I believe we are ready to move forward as one, united team.  House Speaker Paul Ryan spent the past two years drawing lines in the sand regarding President Donald Trump -- and then erasing them when Trump, inevitably, overstepped. In May 2016, Ryan said he couldn't endorse Trump -- even though the businessman was the presumptive nominee -- because he needed to show he could unify the party. Trump didn't. The next month, Ryan said Trump's comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel amounted to "the textbook definition of a racist comment."
