Barbara  took the paper home. There she felt a spiritual urge to take the paper to Bergzabern. On her arrival in Bergzabern, she discovered that she had just missed Krausert, who had proceeded to Anweiler. The next day, she caught up with him, and showed him the paper. But rest was to elude her. She received a spiritual command to journey directly to Bischweiler. There she found Christian Metz very happy to see her. Immediately he informed her that there was a problem with Krausert, and that he, Metz, had delivered a testimony against him. Krausert arrived in Bischweiler that same evening. He told Barbara that he and Metz had had a misunderstanding during their recent journey. The next morning he sent her and Metz off to separate rooms. When they were gone, Krausert told those remaining that Inspiration had now ceased.
