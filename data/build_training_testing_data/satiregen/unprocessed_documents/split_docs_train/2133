Sam passes out with the man and his wives as the Homeless King arrives to capture him, angered by finding dog biscuits in his pocket. When Sam tells him that he did not actually have a dog and kept biscuits only as memory of his painful breakup and knowledge that he would never see his girlfriendâ€™s dog again, the Homeless King lets him go. Returning home, Sam spends the night with a neighbor whose parrot repeats incomprehensible words. From the balcony, Sam watches as his landlord and a police officer enter his apartment to evict him. Williams failed three polygraph tests and hairs and fibers retrieved from the body of another victim, Jimmy Ray Payne, were found to be consistent with those from his home, car and dog. Co-workers told police they had seen Williams with scratches on his face and arms around the time of the murders which, investigators surmised, could have been inflicted by victims during a struggle. Williams held a press conference outside his home to proclaim his innocence, volunteering that he had failed the polygraph tests, which would have been inadmissible in court. As a child British King George VI (1895-1952) was naturally left-handed. He was forced to write with his right hand, as was common practice at the time.

McManus noted that, as the Industrial Revolution spread across Western Europe and the United States in the 19th century, workers needed to operate complex machines that were designed with right-handers in mind.
