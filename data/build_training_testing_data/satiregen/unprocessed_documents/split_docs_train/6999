 Many establishment Republicans on Capitol Hill have been reluctant to embrace Donald Trump's candidacy, but they are now talking up one of their own as a possible vice presidential pick -- Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who served in House GOP leadership -- as a plus to the 2016 ticket. "I have the highest, highest regard for Mike. He's a personal friend of ours and mine," House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters on Tuesday, adding that he would withhold any more comment until Trump announces his pick.  Melania Trump stepped onto center stage Monday for the highest-profile speech of her life, but the moment was quickly overshadowed by controversy after it emerged that portions of the speech were plagiarized from Michelle Obama's 2008 address to the Democratic National Convention. Melania Trump initially appeared to deliver the speech her husband needed to portray him in a softer light. She offered testimony about the character of her husband, Donald Trump, and said he would never let America down. The former fashion model, who rarely takes a leading role on the campaign trail, was the star attraction on the first night of the Republican National Convention.  America's ultimate showman, Donald Trump, has turned his search for a Republican vice presidential pick into a real-life political thriller. He spent Wednesday beguiling the media and playing on the hopes of his final few candidates to build tension, drama and -- perhaps -- a climactic final plot twist. Trump is on the cusp of making the most important decision yet in his short but explosive political career. He said late Wednesday that he will announce who will join him on the GOP ticket at 11 a.m. on Friday.
