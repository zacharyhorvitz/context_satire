 Democratic senators opened Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing with an aggressive approach Tuesday, pushing to postpone the hearing and repeatedly interrupting the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman as they accused Republicans of rushing ahead with a nomination while they wanted more documents about President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee. The tense mood came after a weekend of coordination among Democrats, according to a person familiar. Throughout the holiday weekend, there were ongoing discussions, including a call led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, to lay out a plan ahead of Tuesday's hearing. Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats agreed to protest the document issues at the beginning of the hearing with the goal of slowing down the process.  Fred Guttenberg, the father of a slain Parkland student, said on Twitter that he tried to approach Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh only for the judge to ignore him. The incident occurred as the Senate Judiciary Committee took a recess shortly after noon Tuesday. "Just walked up to Judge Kavanaugh as morning session ended. Put out my hand to introduce myself as Jaime Guttenberg's dad.  A group of protesters bearing a message as stark as their red and white costumes are opposing Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearings. They stood in silence Tuesday, the first day of the hearings, lining the walkways and atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building, their austere silhouettes evoking the dystopian persecution portrayed in the novel-turned-Emmy-award-winning Hulu drama "The Handmaid's Tale." The group's restrained method was a sharp contrast to other scenes going on throughout the Senate side of Capitol Hill. Police arrested 70 people by the end of the day for "unlawful demonstration activities."
