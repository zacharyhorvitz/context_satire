 President Donald Trump's touting of how his administration has accomplished more than any -- yes, any -- past administration in its first two years is one of his most consistent applause lines in his campaign patter. "I don't believe there has been any administration in the history of this country that has done more in two years -- and we're not even up to two years yet -- than our administration," Trump said last week during a campaign speech in Las Vegas -- while reading a literal paper list of those accomplishments. "Nobody has done what this administration has done in terms of getting things passed and getting things through," he told a group of sheriffs earlier this month. His supporters love the line: Despite all of the losers and haters, Trump is MAGA-ing!  For a man who usually shuns global institutions, the United Nations General Assembly in New York may, strangely, be a welcome refuge this week for US President Donald Trump. He has been at his job long enough to know what the handful of world leaders he cares about are likely to bring to the table. China will likely gripe about trade -- ditto Canada, Japan and EU nations, including Germany. South Korea will have an update on North Korea.  Trump is a master of New York-style showmanship. The United Nations General Assembly, therefore, should be his finest hour: hosting world leaders in his town. Instead, he is likely to be relegated to an irrelevant sideshow. When the UNGA kicks off on Tuesday, the depths of America's descent will be on full display.
