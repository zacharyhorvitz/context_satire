Though he continues to work part time as vice chairman of Fidelity Management & Research Co., the investment adviser arm of Fidelity Investments, spending most of his time mentoring young analysts, Peter Lynch focuses a great deal of time on philanthropy. He said he views philanthropy as a form of investment. He said he prefers to give money to support ideas that he thinks can spread, such as First Night, the New Year's Eve festival that began in Boston in 1976 and has inspired similar events in more than 200 other communities, and City Year, a community service program founded in Boston in 1988 that now operates in 29 cities across the U.S. Lynch has stated in One Up on Wall Street that his undergraduate studies in philosophy and logic were more important to his career than the math or finance he studied for his MBA. At Wharton he came to believe that the two prevailing investing theories in academia, the random walk hypothesis and the efficient market hypothesis, were contradictory. The concepts taught by professors at school were regularly disproved by professionals during his internship at Fidelity. He thus came to rely more on practitioners than theoreticians: "It seemed to me that what was supposed to help you succeed in the investment business, could only help you fail  Quantitative analysis taught me that the things I saw happening at Fidelity couldn't really be happening." "It was 2013. The English language seemed spent, despicable, not easily singable. It felt over for English; good for business transactions, but that's about it. The only other language I know is Spanish, and the only Spanish songs I really know are those of Sr. Chinarro, led by Antonio Luque.
