On August 2, 2009, Spielberg stated that he would direct a film adaptation of the play Harvey. Will Smith, Robert Downey, Jr. and Tom Hanks were considered to play the lead role, while Jonathan Tropper was hired to write the screenplay. DreamWorks and 20th Century Fox would have  developed the film. However, Collider confirmed on December 4, 2009, that the project was cancelled due to problems with the lead role selection. In 1997, Steven Spielberg and John Davis were producing the film adaptation The Martian Chronicles, with Michael Tolkin and John Orloff were some of the writers who worked on a script, which failed to get off the ground for Universal Pictures. In 2011, Paramount Pictures acquired the film rights and will produce a film franchise with only Davis producing through Davis Entertainment. In the early 1980s, Spielberg announced that he had plans to direct a film adaptation of the Blackhawk comic book series. Dan Aykroyd was attached to play Blackhawk. However, the project never materialized and Spielberg chose to direct Raiders of the Lost Ark. In April 2018, new development emerged when it was announced that Spielberg will produce/direct a new film adaptation of Blackhawk for Warner Bros., with the screenplay being written by David Koepp.
