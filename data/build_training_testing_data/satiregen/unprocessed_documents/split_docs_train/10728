 President Donald Trump blasted his former attorney Michael Cohen on Wednesday, the morning after CNN aired the audio of a recording Cohen made of the two. "What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before?  Federal prosecutors investigating President Donald Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen have received 12 audio recordings from the materials seized by the FBI during the searches of Cohen's home, office and hotel room, according to court filings. The former judge reviewing the material for attorney-client privilege wrote in a court filing Monday that the parties involved in the case had withdrawn their privilege designation on the 12 audio files on Friday. The items had been under consideration by the special master, Barbara Jones, according to the filing. "Based upon those de-designations, the special master released the 12 items to the government that day," the filing said.  Among those caught off guard Tuesday night by the public airing of Michael Cohen's secret recording of a conversation with his then-client Donald Trump: the federal prosecutors conducting the criminal investigation of Cohen. Cohen's legal team didn't notify the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York that it would be taking the tape to the media, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. On Tuesday evening, CNN's "Cuomo Prime Time" played the recording of the President and his then-personal lawyer discussing a possible payment regarding a former Playboy model who has alleged an affair with Trump. The tape disclosed Cohen telling Trump about plans to set up a shell company and finance the purchase of the rights to the former model's story from American Media Inc., publisher of the National Enquirer.
