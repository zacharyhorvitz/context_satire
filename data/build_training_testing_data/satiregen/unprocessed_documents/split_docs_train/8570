Swift made her TV acting debut in a 2009 episode of CBS's CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, playing a rebellious teenager. The New York Times noted the character allowed Swift to be "a little bit naughty, and credibly so". Later that year, Swift both hosted and performed as the musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live. Entertainment Weekly described her as "this season's best Saturday Night Live host so far", noting she "was always up for the challenge, seemed to be having fun, and helped the rest of the cast nail the punchlines". Prior to stardom, Swift received a publishing contract with Sony/ATV Music. Over the course of that period, Swift composed over 250 songs, either alone or collaborating with other songwriters, mostly with Liz Rose or Robert Ellis Orrall, and refused to give them away to already established acts with intentions of someday singing them herself. When later signed to Big Machine Records, Swift compiled her Taylor Swift album of material written during her publishing contract, and expected to do the same for her second album. She said, "I've been very selfish about my songs. In the ballad "Breathe", the accompaniment consists entirely of string instruments, and Swift singing in regards to love-gone-wrong scenario. The song was a collaboration between Swift and Caillat that surged out of Swift's interest in Caillat's debut Coco (2007). The two arranged a writing session to coincide with Caillat's upcoming concert in Nashville, Tennessee, where they composed "Breathe" about Swift losing a friend very dear to her. "Tell Me Why" was triggered by a love interest she was never in a formal romantic relationship with.
