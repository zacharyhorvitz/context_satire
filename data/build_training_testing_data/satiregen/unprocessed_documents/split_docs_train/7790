 Republican front-runner Mitt Romney declared himself a bit of an outsider Thursday in the upcoming GOP primaries in Mississippi and Alabama, while Rick Santorum battled to emerge from the heart of Dixie as the surviving conservative challenger. The two states are holding their presidential primaries Tuesday, along with caucuses to be held in Hawaii and American Samoa. Voters in Kansas and the Virgin Islands weigh in on Saturday. Mississippi and Alabama have the potential to play a key role in the race. The primary contest began in 2011 with a fairly wide field. Mitt Romney, former Governor of Massachusetts and the runner-up in the 2008 primaries, had been preparing to run for president ever since the 2008 election, and was from early on the favorite to win the nomination. However, he lacked support from the party's conservative wing and the media narrative became: "Who will be the anti-Romney candidate?" Several candidates rose in the polls throughout the year.  Super Tuesday is traditionally a turning point in the campaign for the U.S. presidency, but it may pass without having the impact its name implies because the Republican Party has a pesky problem -- it can't decide whom it wants in the White House. "What you're seeing is that the Republican Party wants to fall in love," said Republican radio host Michael Medved. Mostly it's just been flirting. Four major candidates remain in the race after months of campaigning -- former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum are now trading first place in many polls, with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul trailing behind them.
