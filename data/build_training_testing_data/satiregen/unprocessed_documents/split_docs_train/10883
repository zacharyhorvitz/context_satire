 As the revised version of President Donald Trump's travel ban went into effect Thursday night, the public reaction was muted compared with the massive protests that erupted in January. Small groups of lawyers and volunteers gathered at the arrival terminals of major airports including Chicago, San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. Lawyers had signs in different languages that read: "Do you need an attorney?" and "Free Legal Services" in order to reach people who might be affected by the latest iteration of the travel ban.  Qatar Airways has long been at odds with American Airlines. Now it wants to buy a big chunk of the U.S. carrier. "Qatar Airways indicated that it has an interest in acquiring approximately a ten percent stake," American Airlines said in a statement on Thursday. American, along with Delta and United Airlines, has repeatedly accused state-owned Qatar Airways and its big regional rivals -- Emirates and Etihad of the United Arab Emirates -- of enjoying massive government subsidies that have helped them become leading global players.  Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly announced new aviation security measures Wednesday impacting overseas airports that have direct flights to the United States. Speaking to the Center for New American Security, the DHS chief said if airline carriers refused to follow any of the new security measures they could be banned from operating direct flights to the US. "The threat has not diminished. In fact, I am concerned that we are seeing renewed interest on the part of terrorist groups to go after the aviation sector," he said Wednesday.
