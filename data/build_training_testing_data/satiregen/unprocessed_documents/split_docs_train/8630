In August 2011, the city of New Orleans called for proposals for redevelopment ideas for the site. Eight entrepreneurs stepped forward to suggest turning the property into a power plant, a theme park, or even an outlet mall. On November 29, 2011, the city of New Orleans chose two of the proposed projects: an outlet mall and a green theme park. On February 6, 2012, it was reported that the selection committee rejected the plan for the site of Six Flags New Orleans to become a theme park, leaving the upscale outlet mall as the only proposal being considered by the committee. In early 2003, Six Flags upgraded the park and renamed it "Six Flags New Orleans." Six Flags added more shaded areas and many new flat spinning rides. The park was renamed Six Flags, and the "it's playtime!" theme was adopted that included a dancing old man, Mr. Six. Beginning in 2001 the park was named Six Flags Worlds of Adventure, boasting 750 acres, it became the largest Six Flags park. The property was divided into three sections known as wild life, the former SeaWorld park, wild rides, formerly Geauga Lake, and wild slides, a 10 acre water park, all included in a single gate price. The sale of SeaWorld Cleveland did not include the three current killer whales or the park's dolphins. The killer whale show was replaced by three dolphins from Six Flags Discovery Kingdom until a new killer whale, Shouka, arrived on loan from a park in France.
