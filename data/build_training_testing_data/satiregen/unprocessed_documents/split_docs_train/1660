Sanrio decided to make Hello Kitty British because at the time of her creation, foreign countries, in particular, Britain, were trendy in Japan. Sanrio already had several characters set in the US, and it wanted Hello Kitty to be different. Shimizu got the name Kitty from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass; during a scene early in the book, Alice plays with a cat she calls Kitty. Sanrio's motto is "social communication," and Tsuji wanted the brand name to reflect that. Hello Kitty was originally marketed only towards a child and preteen audience. In the 1990s, the target market for Hello Kitty was broadened to include teens and adults as a retro brand. Marketed to those who could not get Hello Kitty merchandise as children, or who fondly remember items they had, Sanrio began selling Hello Kitty branded products such as purses and laptops. The 1994â€“1996 Face series was the first to be designed for a more mature appeal. In 1994, artist Tom Sachs was invited to create a scene for Barneys New York Christmas displays and titled it Hello Kitty Nativity. For this scene, the Virgin Mary was replaced by Hello Kitty with an open Chanel bra, the three Kings were all Bart Simpson, and the stable was marked by a McDonald's logo. This contemporary revision of the nativity scene received mostly great attention, and demonstrated Sachs' interest in the phenomena of consumerism, branding, and the cultural fetishization of products.
