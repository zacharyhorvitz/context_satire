 There are plenty of folks in the United States who are excited about Prince Harry's upcoming wedding to actress Meghan Markle. Of course, she's not the first American to marry into the British royal family. Queen Elizabeth II's uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorc√©e Wallis Simpson -- something unheard of at the time. The fact that so many in the US already know this shows that America's fascination with the British royal family started long before Harry met Meghan.  The US surgeon general issued an advisory Thursday recommending that more Americans carry the opioid overdose-reversing drug, naloxone. The drug, sold under the brand name Narcan (among others), can very quickly restore normal breathing in someone suspected of overdosing on opioids, including heroin and prescription pain medications. Dr. Jerome Adams emphasized that "knowing how to use naloxone and keeping it within reach can save a life." To make his point, Adams relied on a rarely used tool: the surgeon general's advisory.  President Donald Trump's unexpected announcement on Thursday that the US would "be coming out of Syria like very soon" is raising concerns among some national security officials who warn that withdrawing now would not only undermine American credibility in the region but prompt a significant escalation to an already devastating conflict. While Trump has often touted the gains made against ISIS since taking office, his latest comments caught much of his own administration off-guard -- including defense officials who have warned that now is not the time to withdraw from Syria. "We're knocking the hell out of ISIS. We'll be coming out of Syria like very soon," Trump told supporters outside of Cleveland during a speech that was meant to focus on infrastructure."
