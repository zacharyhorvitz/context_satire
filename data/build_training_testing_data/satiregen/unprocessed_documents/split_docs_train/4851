 New details fueled debate Monday over security at the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in Sochi: Wanted posters of a terrorism suspect on the loose, warships at the ready and a video threat from beyond the grave. Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed that his country has stepped up security and is prepared to handle any threats. But some U.S. lawmakers -- and at least one Olympic athlete -- have said they're worried about the situation. Hotels warned about terror suspect Police in Sochi have handed out fliers at area hotels warning of a woman they believe could be a terrorist and who may currently be in the city.  The Winter Olympics is a matter of days away but whether you are using an abacus or calculator the numbers just don't add up. President Vladimir Putin's reputation is on the line and no expense has been spared to stage the Games next month. The 2014 Winter Games will be the most expensive in the history of the Olympics -- $50 billion and rising. Beijing in 2008 cost an estimated $40 billion, though the exact cost is not known.  A video surfaces threatening the Winter Olympics. Russia's President vows the Games will be safe. Some U.S. lawmakers warn that they won't be. One thing was clear as debate over the situation surged on Sunday: security is a top concern, less than three weeks away from the competition.
