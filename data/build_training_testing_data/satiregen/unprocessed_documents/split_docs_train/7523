In June 2006, he was the guest host for an episode in the third series of The Friday Night Project for the United Kingdom's Channel 4. Lowe has also appeared in a televised advertisement for 'Visit California', along with other celebrities including Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. (In the advertisement campaign, he was usually pictured in a white tee-shirt printed with the California state flag.) Lowe had a supporting role in the 2009 movie The Invention of Lying and a leading role in Too Late to Say Goodbye. Sean was the third-place finalist on Emily Maynard's season of The Bachelorette. He ended up going on two one-on-one dates with Maynard and one group date. In the ninth episode, Sean told Maynard that he was falling in love with her. Emily offered him an overnight date card to spend more time with him, but he did not stay the night as it didn't line up with Emily's beliefs and the example that she wanted to set for her daughter. Lowe is known for his strong faith. When asked to categorize which denomination his religion falls under, he responded "I'm a Christian. And that's how I categorize myself, and you know, that's obviously a huge part of my life as most people know, and that's what's most important to me."
