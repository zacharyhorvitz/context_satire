Gordon is a born again Christian. He has talked about how in the early-1990s he got curious and followed some drivers to the weekly chapel one week, which is how he first started to learn more about God. During this time, Gordon kept verses of the Bible taped to his steering wheel. In 2004, Gordon stated he "has a difficult time focusing on one particular faith."  Three Portland, Oregon, teens are accused of luring a classmate into a shed, hitting him in the head with a crowbar, shooting him with a BB gun -- and then using a box cutter to carve a swastika into his forehead. "There is no understanding what they did," Kelli Murrain, the victim's mother, told CNN affiliate KPTV. "Roll it around in your head and you just go, 'Oh my God.' For the grace of God I could have lost my youngest son." Christians ( (listen)) are people who follow or adhere to Christianity, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The words Christ and Christian derive from the Koine Greek title Christós (Χριστός), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term mashiach (מָשִׁיחַ).While there are diverse interpretations of Christianity which sometimes conflict, they are united in believing that Jesus has a unique significance.The term "Christian" used as an adjective is descriptive of anything associated with Christianity or Christian churches, or in a proverbial sense "all that is noble, and good, and Christ-like." It does not have a meaning of 'of Christ' or 'related or pertaining to Christ'. According to a 2011 Pew Research Center survey, there were 2.2 billion Christians around the world in 2010, up from about 600 million in 1910.
