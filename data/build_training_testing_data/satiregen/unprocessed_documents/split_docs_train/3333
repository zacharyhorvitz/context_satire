YouTube announced the rebranding of the service as YouTube Premium on May 17, 2018, alongside the return of a separate, YouTube Music subscription service. Later in the year, it was reported that YouTube was planning to make some of the original content associated with the service available on an ad-supported basis.  In the wake of the Logan Paul controversy, YouTube is trying to reassure advertisers by pledging to "manually review" a significant chunk of the videos on its website. This means that actual workers, not just algorithms, will review the videos that are within "Google Preferred," YouTube's special program for premium advertising. The program was created to convince big advertisers to spend more money on YouTube. It fences off the site's most popular videos and lets companies buy ads alongside those videos. YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California. It was founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim in February 2005, and the first video was "Me at the zoo" uploaded by Karim on his channel in April 2005. Although the most-viewed videos were initially viral videos, such as "Evolution of Dance" and "Charlie Bit My Finger", the most-viewed videos were increasingly related to music videos. In fact, since Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance", every video that has reached the top of the "most-viewed YouTube videos" list has been a music video.
