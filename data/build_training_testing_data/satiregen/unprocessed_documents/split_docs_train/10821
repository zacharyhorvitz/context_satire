London Mayor Boris Johnson admitted frittering away his student years "fooling around", but said he hoped his "embarrassing" antics with the Bullingdon Club drinking society could now be forgotten. Reminded of his membership of the Bullingdon alongside Eton contemporary David Cameron, the Mayor told Bryer: "I owe the Oxford Union and the institutions there a huge amount. If I have a regret, it's that I spent so much time fooling around, frittering my time at Oxford when I should have focused more on serious stuff." In 2014, Matt Damon revealed to Bryer that he would be "open" to reprising the role of Jason Bourne. Damon talked about stardom, his upbringing and how meeting childhood friend Ben Affleck changed their lives. He spoke about the battles they had to overcome to make Good Will Hunting and how he felt when he won his Oscar. He also discussed why he chooses to keep his family out of the spotlight and how he copes with fame: "It kind of happens overnight and you're aware that the world is exactly the same as it was yesterday â€¦ It's a very surreal experience because you know intellectually that the world is the same, it's just never ever going to be the same for you." In a rare interview at Buckingham Palace in 2014, Prince Andrew, The Duke of York revealed to Bryer that he remains friends with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson for the sake of his family and because he feels it would be "illogical" not to. He said it was important they have a good relationship for their daughters and called her a "fantastic mother". He told Bryer, "It's just part of life's rich tapestry. If you've been married to somebody I just see it as illogical not to be a friend at the end of the day, regardless of what your set of circumstances are."
