Publisher Rupert Hart-Davis was a client when Goodman was a partner in Rubenstein Nash; Goodman reached an agreement with Churchill and Beaverbrook over G. M. Young's life of Stanley Baldwin in 1952, though it required the "hideously expensive" job of removing and replacing seven leaves with revised wording in 7,580 copies of the book. In 1963, Goodman (now in his own firm, Goodman Derrick) arranged for Granada Television to take over Hart-Davis's loss-making publishing firm and Hart-Davis "wasn't surprised when he became a leading trouble-shooter for the government". After hearing details of the firm's finances for ten or fifteen minutes Goodman dictated everything back to his secretary: "the most amazing feat of mental agility Iâ€™ve ever seen or heard of". In the documentary about the Detroit techno scene, High Tech Soul, May notes that he saw people in Italy wearing Underground Resistance shirts and was surprised at the group's success outside of Detroit. He says, "People were going crazy over Underground Resistance, and it was like they weren't even there." Browne attended the 2019 WWE Hall Of Fame ceremony with his wife who was working with the WWE. During the event a fan rushed the stage and tackled former wrestler Bret Hart, who was being inducted as a member of the tag team The Hart Foundation. Browne was one of several men who ran onto the stage to help subdue the man. Hart later thanked Browne the next night during WrestleMania 35.
