Michael Moore in TrumpLand is a 2016 documentary film by Michael Moore about the 2016 United States presidential election campaign. The film is based on a one-person show that Moore originally wanted to perform in Midland Theatre in Newark, Ohio on October 7, but management of the Midland Theatre chose not to honor a rental contract. He eventually held the show at the Murphy Theatre in Wilmington, Ohio, with the movie based on a recording of that performance over two nights in October. On June 24, 2009, AMPAS announced that the number of films to be nominated in the Best Picture award category would increase from five to ten, starting with the 82nd Academy Awards (2009). The expansion was a throwback to the Academy's early years in the 1930s and 1940s, when eight to 12 films were nominated each year. "Having 10 Best Picture nominees is going to allow Academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other Oscar categories but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize," AMPAS President Sid Ganis said in a press conference. "I can't wait to see what that list of 10 looks like when the nominees are announced in February." Michael Francis Moore (born April 23, 1954) is an American documentary filmmaker, actor, and author. He is best known for his work on globalization and capitalism. Moore won the 2002 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for Bowling for Columbine, which examined the causes of the Columbine High School massacre of April 20, 1999, and the overall gun culture of the United States. He also directed and produced Fahrenheit 9/11, a critical look at the presidency of George W. Bush and the War on Terror, which earned $119,194,771 to become the highest-grossing documentary at the American box office of all time.
