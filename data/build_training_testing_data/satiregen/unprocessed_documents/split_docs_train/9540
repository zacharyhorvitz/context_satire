Scott had long been committed to civil rights, particularly in Hollywood. She refused to take roles in Hollywood that cast her as a "singing maid." When she began performing in Hollywood films, she insisted on having final cut privileges when it came to her appearance. In addition, she required control over her own wardrobe so that she could wear her own clothing if she felt that the studio's choices were unacceptable. She was prominent as a jazz singer throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In 1950, she became the first black American to host her own TV show, The Hazel Scott Show,. Her career in America faltered after she testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy era. Scott subsequently moved to Paris in the late 1950s and began performing in Europe, not returning to the United States until 1967. She went on to do few advertisements for Ponds, Nokia, HSBC and Samsung before landing with her first proper role in the film MP3: Mera Pehla Pehla Pyaar in 2007. She also worked in shows, for which she got highly paid.
