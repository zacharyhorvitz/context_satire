Graham has never been married and has no children. He helped to raise his sister, Darline Graham Nordone, after the deaths of his mother and father, which occurred within fifteen months of each other, leaving the two without parents when Graham was 22 and she was 13. Experiencing the early deaths of his parents, Graham says, made him mature more quickly, and Nordone, who introduced her brother at his formal announcement of his candidacy for the 2016 presidential race, said she hoped to be with him on the campaign trail frequently to show voters his softer side. "He's kind of like a brother, a father and a mother rolled into one," she said. It had been speculated that Graham could be a potential presidential candidate since at least October 2014, when he had  stated that he would explore running for president in the 2016 election if he were re-elected as a Senator in the 2014 election, and began appearing at events and discussing a potential Presidential bid. Graham was previously considered as a possible Vice President for Republican presidential nominee John McCain in the 2008 presidential election, however former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was later chosen for the job. Following a multiple shooting incident at an historic African American church in Charleston on June 17, 2015, Graham canceled all campaign events to return to South Carolina. In response to questions from the press regarding the calls from some, following the incident, to remove the Confederate flag at a war memorial on the South Carolina State Capitol grounds, Graham said: "Well, at the end of the day it's time for people in South Carolina to revisit that decision. would be fine with me, but this is part of who we are." He continued, "The flag represents to some people a civil war, and that was the symbol of one side.
