For the 1964 season, Parnell had commissioned a design for a new car, when he died from peritonitis at age 52 after a routine appendix operation went wrong. Parnell's son Tim, also a racing driver, took over the team management and developed a strong working relationship with BRM during the late 1960s. Ellen Martin and her husband Joe are on a pleasure boat at Lake George, New York, when it capsizes, drowning Joe. When Ellen tries to get compensation from the boating company for Joe's death, she cannot because the reinsurance company that the boat company's owner and son Matthew bought their policy from was sold to another company based out of Nevis. The Nevis-based company is actually a trust of one of Mossack's shell companies and is under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for fraud. After her attempts to contact Mossack and the Nevis-based company are unsuccessful, Ellen travels to Nevis to confront Malchus Boncamper, the manager of the trust. He became the team manager of Aston Martin, a move which led him to oversee a famous 1–2 in 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans, when Roy Salvadori and Carroll Shelby led home Maurice Trintignant and Paul Frère. The company then decided to enter Formula One and Parnell led the team but at the end of 1960 the programme was abandoned.
