 As the presidential candidates head into their final day of campaigning, both President Obama and Mitt Romney are focusing on the biggest prizes: the elusive swing states. CNN currently lists Pennsylvania as likely to "lean Obama," but both campaigns are fighting for the Keystone state. Just one day after Mitt Romney took the stage in Pennsylvania, President Obama is deploying Bill Clinton to the state for four campaign states. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), who campaigned with both Romney and Paul Ryan this weekend, weighs in on the final push for his state on "Starting Point" today.  In the end, the Etch A Sketch didn't work. Mitt Romney, the multimillionaire who touted his business credentials as the Republican presidential hopeful, failed to convince voters that he was the man to unseat President Barack Obama and jump-start the economy. "We have given our all to this campaign," Romney told supporters in his concession speech. "I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader, and so Ann and I join with you to earnestly pray for him and this great nation."  The frenetic pace of presidential campaigning that has crested in the last few days -- in which the candidates or their surrogates hit 10 states -- won't end when voters go to the polls on Tuesday. Republican candidate Mitt Romney will campaign in two states on Election Day - Ohio and Pennsylvania - according to a Romney campaign official. Campaigning on Election Day, a senior Romney adviser says, will help "keep the energy going" until the polls close. The idea is that the campaign is "just going to keep working up until the polls close," said the same Romney adviser.
