Poor Ian did not know a word of Russian, and Dapkūnaitė lives in England. So he always rushed to her, complained about how he was forced to sit in the pit, how he was forced to climb into the river, how he nearly drowned there, how Balabanov said to someone right in front of Ian that he was a bad actor. For Westerners, this is an entirely unacceptable way of communication. Each time, Inga patiently explained that this is how the Russians work - that Russians always scream, and if they open fire, they only use live ammunition. McIntyre asked what they would do if he induced his comrades to surrender. Kelly stated, "I'll shoot no man if he holds up his hands", and that he would detain them all night, as he wanted a sleep, and let them go next morning without their guns or horses. McIntyre said that he would induce them to surrender if Kelly kept his word, and added that one of the two had many children. Kelly said, "You can depend on us". Early the next day, Kennedy and Scanlon went down to the creek to explore, leaving McIntyre to attend to camp duty. At about noon Lonigan heard a strange noise down by the creek and McIntyre went to investigate, hoping that it could be some kangaroos that he could shoot for dinner. Instead, he shot and killed some parrots which he cooked for dinner. (Unaware at the time, the sound of the shots alerted the bushrangers to their location.)
