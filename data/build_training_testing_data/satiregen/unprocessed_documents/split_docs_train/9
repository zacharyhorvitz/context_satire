 Pacific Gas & Electric began Wednesday to cut electricity to homes and businesses in more than a dozen areas as the California utility tries to avert wildfires. Some areas without power are in California's wine country from Geyserville to Sonoma. There are also affected areas along the Sierra Nevada foothills including Paradise, the town that was decimated by the Camp Fire last year. About 179,000 customers will lose electricity, the power company, which is in bankruptcy procedures, said earlier.  Matthew Valdivia woke Thursday to the smell of smoke, and looked outside to see the glow of a wildfire in the hills near his home in San Bernardino. After waking up his wife and children and some neighbors, the Valdivia family joined thousands of other Southern Californians who've had to flee fires. And like those other evacuees, the Valdivias hoped  firefighters could save their house. It burned to the ground before sunrise.  Every time Stephanie Stauer hears about a red flag warning, her anxiety spikes off the charts. In 2017, the home in Santa Rosa, California, where she lived with her husband and two children was destroyed by the Tubbs Fire. In June, they moved into a new house, built on the same ground where their previous one stood. But soon after firefighters began battling the Kincade Fire last week, the Stauers had to evacuate again.
