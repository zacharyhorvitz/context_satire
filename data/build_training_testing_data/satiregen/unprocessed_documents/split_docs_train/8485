 Hillary Clinton would beat Donald Trump "in a landslide" in a general election matchup, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham says. Graham, the South Carolina senator who, like Trump, is seeking the GOP presidential nomination, hit Trump over his harsh words on women and undocumented immigrants in an interview with CNN's Brianna Keilar on Monday. "Hillary Clinton would beat him like a drum," Graham said. He said Republicans should stop "tip-toeing around" Trump and address his harsh rhetoric, especially when it comes to immigrants and women.  Rick Perry has stopped paying his campaign staff, including in the key early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, as his candidacy struggles to generate momentum -- and cash. The campaign's South Carolina state chairman Katon Dawson said Monday that operatives working for the campaign would no longer be paid, while Republican officials in Iowa and New Hampshire told CNN that campaign workers in both states also were notified they would not be paid. They were encouraged to stay on as volunteers, if they were able, to help Perry get through a lean summer. The halting of pay to all campaign workers was confirmed by a GOP official.  One day after Gawker published one of presidential candidate Donald Trump's old cell phone numbers, the real estate mogul is taking control of the situation by changing his voicemail and taunting the media outlet on social media. "Thank you @gawker! Call me on my cellphone 917.756.8000 and listen to my campaign message," Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. Call the number Gawker published Monday and you'll hear from The Donald himself.
