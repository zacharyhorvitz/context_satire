Robert Young Pelton reported that no evidence of Galkin's torture were present when he was interviewed, although, he was thin, emaciated and his bore bruises from being bound for so long. Pelton interviewed Galkin and asked if he had been tortured or mistreated. Galkin was nervous, and when Pelton asked him why, he said with humor that he had never been on CNN before referring to his career as a spy. Musayev twice interrupted Galkin when Pelton asked whether Galkin voluntarily confessed and whether he is afraid of something, saying that "You don't need to answer this question".

She is best friends with Lucy and Sue and they often go out together. Unser is still living on the Teller Morrow grounds. He is jokingly known as "Uncle Touchy", as he willingly helps Jax and Gemma with the boys.
