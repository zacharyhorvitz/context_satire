In the episode, "The Fox and the Wolf", it is revealed Noshiko Yukimura had summoned the Nogitsune in the first place back in 1943. Noshiko had wanted him to possess her to seek vengeance upon the corrupt army medics that had caused a manslaughter at Camp Oak Creek, by selling medical supplies for her fellow interns on the black market and the death of her lover Corporal Rhys. She wanted her pain and tragic experience to imbue the Void Kitsune spirit with power. Only the trickster, once it was unleashed from Noshiko's prayers to her ancestors, he instead possessed the bandaged corpse of Rhys because a Kitsune cannot be controlled. Deucalion's Alpha Pack arrived in Beacon Hills in the Season 2 finale, capturing Boyd and Erica in the process. In "Unleashed", Deucalion goes to Derek's loft along with Kali and Ennis to offer Derek a proposition for Derek to kill his own Pack to join his own with the intention of recruiting him. Deucalion's actual plan for Derek was to place him against Scott. To this end, after the battle between the Packs in "Frayed", Deucalion kills Ennis after he fails to heal himself, absorbing Ennis' power; he lies to Kali and the twins that Ennis died of his wounds, intending to have a vengeful, distraught Kali force Derek's decision to join the Alpha Pack. In "Wolf's Bane", Harris is questioned by Sheriff Stilinski regarding the murderous events that take place during Season 1 after the Alpha werewolf tries to kill him. Harris reveals that six years ago, he babbled to a woman on how to set a house on fire and make it look like it was not an act of arson after she got him drunk. A few days after he gave this information, a house caught on fire and was burned down (the Hale family mass murder). The woman he gave information to is revealed to be Kate Argent.
