The Marlboro advertising campaign, created by Leo Burnett Worldwide, is said to be one of the most brilliant advertisement campaigns of all time. It transformed a feminine campaign, with the slogan "Mild as May", into one that was masculine, in a matter of months.

Death in the West, a Thames Television documentary, is an exposé of the cigarette industry that aired on British television in 1976.
