 Republicans aren't waiting for Brett Kavanaugh's main accuser to have her say. With a generational conservative goal of a Supreme Court majority in sight, Senate GOP leaders are sketching a voting timetable that could see him confirmed within days even as they brace for a crucial hearing on Thursday on which the judge's fate rests. In another bold move, the party hired a female prosecutor experienced in sex crime cases to question Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers in the 1980s. Kavanaugh denies all the allegations against him.  The man who has been named as a witness to the alleged incident between Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and professor Christine Blasey Ford in the early 1980s has been interviewed by the FBI, according to the man's lawyer. In a statement on Monday, Mark Judge's lawyer, Barbara Van Gelder, said: "Mr. Judge has been interviewed by the FBI but his interview has not been completed. We request your patience as the FBI completes its investigation." Judge is a former classmate of Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault.  President Donald Trump praised his Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh on Saturday night, tying a vote for the nominee to combating the Democratic party's tactics. "A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia. Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process. Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
