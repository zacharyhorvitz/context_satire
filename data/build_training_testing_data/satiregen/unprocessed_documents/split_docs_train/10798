 Life happens: A broken-down car. A leaky roof. A broken bone. If you were hit with a $1,000 emergency, would you be able to cover it?  The fear factor surrounding self-driving cars appears to be slowly receding. AAA released a study Wednesday showing that 63% of Americans are afraid of riding in a self-driving vehicle, down from 78% the previous year. This is the third year that AAA has polled the U.S. population on how people feel about autonomous vehicles. The prior two years had shown a consistent level of discomfort.  For Americans, September 11, 2001 will forever be etched into our memories. The world watched as an always resolute nation fell victim to a horrific act of terror on its own soil. Our enemies celebrated in a seemingly impervious nation being brought to its knees, if only for a moment. More than 15 years later, America remains a beacon of hope in an increasingly dangerous world -- due, in large part, to those who combat terror, often away from the public eye and with little recognition.
