In 2003, Charles had successful hip replacement surgery and was planning to go back on tour, until he began suffering from other ailments. He died at his home in Beverly Hills, California of complications resulting from liver failure, on June 10, 2004, at the age of 73. His funeral took place on June 18, 2004, at the First AME Church in Los Angeles with numerous musical figures in attendance. B.B. Ray Charles' mother died in the spring of 1945, when Ray was 14. Her death came as a shock to him; he later said the deaths of his brother and mother were "the two great tragedies" of his life. Charles returned to school after the funeral but was expelled in October for playing a prank on his teacher. In 2010, Wexler returned to Philadelphia and graduated summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania. He started a music management company, where he represented several recording artists including Rachel Platten  (singer of the Top 10 hit "Fight Song"), as well as a handful of established models. The following year, Wexler built The Brain House, a modern-day songwriting commune in the Hollywood Hills where he invited a group of writers, musicians, and artists to live and work together under one roof.
