On an interview with Global Grind on November 15, R. Kelly stated that he has a song that he is going to be servicing to Celine Dion and it could be their first song together after the number one single "I'm Your Angel" in 1998. He also confirmed that Trapped in the Closet is going to Broadway and that he's working on making movies and also more chapters for his Hip Hopera, telling his fans that they will see a lot going on for him in past two or three years and more. He is also working with singer Mariah Carey for her new upcoming album "The Art of Letting Go". Over two decades R. Kelly has faced allegations including marrying a 15-year-old girl, R&B singer Aaliyah, by listing her age as 18 on the marriage certificate. The singer has also been sued and accused of supposed sex with an underage girl. On one count it is apparent Kelly videotaped one of these encounters. The singer then went on to face more charges of underage sex charges, child pornography charges and sex cult claims. In May 2018, the Women of Color branch of the Time's Up movement called for a boycott of Kelly's music and performances over the many allegations against him. The boycott was accompanied by a social media campaign called Mute R. Kelly. In response, his management said that Kelly supports the movement in principle, but targeting him was "the attempted lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture".
