As Creighton Prep is a private institution, it is not required to follow the No Child Left Behind Act. This means that poor academic performance is grounds for expulsion from Creighton Prep if the student's performance does not meet a minimum threshold. This threshold is defined by a student failing two or more classes at a given time. Therefore, the program Peer Tutoring is designed to serve an intervention role in improving grades prior to considering expulsion or further disciplinary action. Thomas attended Westside High School in Omaha, where she was a member of the student government, the debate club, and the Republican club. While she was still in high school, her ambition was to be a member of Congress. She enrolled in a woman's college in Virginia because of its proximity to Washington, D.C., subsequently transferred to the University of Nebraska, and then to Creighton University to be closer to a boyfriend. She received a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Business Communication from Creighton University (1979) and a Juris Doctor from Creighton University School of Law (1983), after a hiatus working as a legislative aide for Congressman Hal Daub. Since 2005, Creighton and St. Joseph's have had an agreement that sends Creighton medical students to Phoenix for one-month rotations. Under the new affiliation, Creighton will establish a fully operational campus at St. Joseph's that will offer two full years of clinical training. Creighton expanded its entering medical class from 126 to 152 students in 2010. All students will train for their first two years in Omaha.
