However, after a life-threatening situation in the season 8 finale, Jamie and Eddie fully accepted their feelings and got engaged. When they announced their engagement to the Reagan family, Frank offered Eddie her choice of a new precinct assignment. However, Jamie pointed out that there is no actual regulation prohibiting married NYPD officers from being partnered on the job. Therefore, they have decided to remain partners as well. Jamie's first partner and Training Officer, Sergeant Tony Renzulli knows the beat of his precinct very well and often offers Jamie good advice when he needs it. He believes Jamie will make a great cop, and often pokes fun at him for abandoning a lucrative law career. He was also the Training Officer for Joe. In season 3, he moves to an apparent desk job managing the patrolmen of the 12th Precinct. He was stationed at the 12th Precinct, and is partnered with Sgt. Anthony Renzulli (his training officer) in seasons one and two, Officer Vinny Cruz in season three, and Officer  Eddie  Janko since season four. Upon Jamieâ€™s promotion to Sergeant, he is transferred to the 29th Precinct. During his first year on the job, Jamie was the one who continued Joe Reagan's investigation into the Blue Templar.
