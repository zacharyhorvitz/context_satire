On Monday, February 3, 2020, Kenneth Starr, a member of President Trump's legal counsel in the Impeachment Trial, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the Senate floor in his defense of the President. Martin Luther King III responded in a public statement released the following day. The Hill reported that "King accused the Trump administration of invoking his father while failing to address the political issues most important to him and his civil rights advocacy." .  President Donald Trump on Monday made an unscheduled, unannounced trip to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in recognition of the holiday honoring the civil rights icon. Vice President Mike Pence joined the President on the brisk January afternoon, just a couple hours before Trump is set to depart the White House for a quick trip to Davos, Switzerland, to attend the World Economic Forum. Earlier Monday, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway told reporters in the briefing room that Trump "agrees with many of the things that Dr. Martin Luther King stood for and agreed with for many years, including unity and equality." Conway also suggested King would have opposed Trump's impeachment. Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 â€“ April 4, 1968) was an American Christian minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the Civil Rights Movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. King is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi. King led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he then led an unsuccessful 1962 struggle against segregation in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama.
