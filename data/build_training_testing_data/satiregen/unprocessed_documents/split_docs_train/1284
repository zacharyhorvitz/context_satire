People in the Middle East have heavily relied on Al Jazeera to obtain news about their regions and the world even more than YouTube and Google. Hillary Clinton, who at the time of the Arab Spring was the U.S. Secretary of State stated that “Al-Jazeera has been the leader in that  literally changing people’s minds and attitudes. And like it or hate it, it is really effective.” Al Jazeera (Arabic: الجزيرة‎, romanized: al-jazīrah, IPA: , literally "The Island", though referring to the Arabian Peninsula in context) is a Qatari state-funded broadcaster in Doha, Qatar, owned by the Al Jazeera Media Network. Initially launched as an Arabic news and current-affairs satellite TV channel, Al Jazeera has since expanded into a network with several outlets, including the Internet and specialty television channels in multiple languages. Al Jazeera Media Network is a major global news organization, with 80 bureaus around the world. The original Al Jazeera Arabic channel's willingness to broadcast dissenting views, for example on call-in shows, created controversies in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. Walid Phares indicated that the Qatar-owned Al Jazeera television network became the "primary ideological and communication network" for the Muslim Brotherhood during the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Syria in 2011. He noted that after democratic forces had initiated the rebellions, Al Jazeera played a "tremendous role" in supporting the Islamist elements of the revolution.
