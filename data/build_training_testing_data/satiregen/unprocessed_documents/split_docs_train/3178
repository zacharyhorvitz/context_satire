In 2008, Montagnier and his colleague Françoise Barré-Sinoussi from the Institut Pasteur were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the discovery of HIV. Harald zur Hausen also shared the Prize for his discovery that human papilloma viruses lead to cervical cancer, but Gallo was left out. Gallo said that it was "a disappointment" that he was not named a co-recipient. Montagnier said he was "surprised" Gallo was not recognized by the Nobel Committee: "It was important to prove that HIV was the cause of AIDS, and Gallo had a very important role in that. A differing account of the murder was offered by Frank Sheeran, a hitman and labor union boss. Shortly before his death in 2003 Sheeran claimed that he was the lone triggerman in the Gallo hit, on orders from mobster Russell Bufalino who felt that Gallo was drawing undue attention with his flashy lifestyle and Italian American Civil Rights League. Coffey and several other New York police officers accept that Sheeran killed Gallo. Furthermore, an eyewitness at Umberto's on the night of the incident, later a New York Times editor who spoke on condition of anonymity, also identified Sheeran the man she observed shooting Gallo.
