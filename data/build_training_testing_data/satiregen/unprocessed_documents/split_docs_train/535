 It doesn't take a social anthropologist to see that Italians truly love a lot about American culture. It is evident everywhere, from the popularity of Coca-Cola and Levi's to the prevalence of American music and movies. But for all they like about American culture, it's fair to say Italians are getting a little weary of the American attitude -- especially when it comes to justice. Italians point to a number of high-profile cases over the years in which they say American suspects have been accused of wrongdoing and criminal acts, but have been let off lightly.  U.S. stocks may be hitting new highs on nearly a daily basis, but many aren't enjoying the benefits of the rally. Stock ownership among Americans is at a record low. Just 52% of adults say that they or their spouse own any stocks, either individually or through funds. That's according to Gallup, which began tracking this in 1998.  Eight service members were killed in three separate attacks in Afghanistan on Saturday, NATO officials said. In one attack, a roadside bomb killed five U.S. service members in southern Afghanistan, U.S. and NATO officials said. The blast killed took place in the Maiwand district of Kandahar province, said the governor's spokesman, Javid Faisal. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
