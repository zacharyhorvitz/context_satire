 They were known as immigration hardliners long before President Donald Trump took office. And the defeats they suffered in Tuesday's midterm elections sparked swift declarations of victory from immigrant rights groups. Republican Kris Kobach -- who became a national celebrity in some circles for his attempts to help cities kick out undocumented immigrants -- lost his bid for governor of Kansas. Lou Barletta -- who also drew national notoriety for such an effort as the Republican mayor of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and enlisted Kobach's help to defend it -- lost his bid for a US Senate seat.  On Tuesday night, the American people sent House lawmakers a message: When you attack our health care, we will kick you out of office. For nearly two years, Republicans in Congress and the White House repeatedly sabotaged black, white and brown Americans' access to health care: They thought they could get away with attacking the Affordable Care Act and protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and they were wrong. Let's be clear: The Republican Party attacked Americans' access to health care -- and it cost them the House of Representatives. In fact, according to CNN exit polls, heath care was the number one issue motivating voters in the midterms.    The mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday is horrifying. Men, women and children at prayer should feel safe. Racist and anti-Semitic hatred should have no place anywhere in this country. As we mourn the 11 dead and the injured others, including the law-enforcement officers who ran selflessly toward the gunfire, we are saddened but not surprised.
