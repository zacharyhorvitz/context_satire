 A Cincinnati man was in court Friday after authorities say he disciplined his daughter by twice tying her up with duct tape, then locking her in a dog cage. In a Hamilton County court Friday, Judge Fanon Rucker set $50,000 bail for James Tapke after he was charged with endangering children. The defendant, along with his son, allegedly took photos of the entire incident that ended up online. Tapke's lawyer said during the court session that his client didn't commit a crime, but rather took part in "a joke that got out of control." James was born on December 30, 1984 in Akron, Ohio to Gloria Marie James, who was 16 at the time of his birth. :22 His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life. When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work. Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old. Beginning in 1842, his father was employed to work on a railroad in Russia. After moving to St. Petersburg to join his father a year later, the young Whistler took private art lessons, then enrolled in the Imperial Academy of Arts at age eleven. The young artist followed the traditional curriculum of drawing from plaster casts and occasional live models, revelled in the atmosphere of art talk with older peers, and pleased his parents with a first-class mark in anatomy. In 1844, he met the noted artist Sir William Allan, who came to Russia with a commission to paint a history of the life of Peter the Great.
