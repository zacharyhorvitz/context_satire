In April 2016, it was announced that Pearl Mackie would portray the newest companion Bill Potts, after the departure of Jenna Coleman. To avoid leaks while casting the new companion, the production team used the word "Mean Town", an anagram of "Ten Woman"; this is a reference to the fact that Bill is the companion in the tenth series, and was revealed by the casting director Andy Pryor to Radio Times. Producer Steven Moffat said Mackie's ethnicity was a factor in the decision to cast her, as he wanted to make the cast more diverse: "We decided that the new companion was going to be non-white  because we need to do better on that". Bill is also the show's first openly gay companion. When Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) first meets Jay, there is chemistry between them. When Jay asks her out, Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine) pushes her into accepting. Steph is hesitant about going out with Jay as she is still feeling guilty about her failed relationship with Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney). Of Jay, Carla Bonner said "Jay's a bit more rugged than Toadie, but while Toadie's not your classic beefcake, that hasn't put Steph off in the past". Heather Pryor, played by Georgina Andrews, made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 19 February 2008. Andrews successfully auditioned for the role of Heather and she said that she liked the character straight away. Andrews describes Heather as "feisty" and says that her job and career are important to her. She said that Heather was not mean, but as a journalist she had to push to get her stories.
