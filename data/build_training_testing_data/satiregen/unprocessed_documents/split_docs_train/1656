Tidying Up with Marie Kondo is a reality television series developed for Netflix and released on January 1, 2019. The show follows Marie Kondo, a Japanese organizing consultant and creator of the KonMari method, as she visits families to help them organize and tidy their homes. Marie Iida acts as Marie Kondo's interpreter throughout the show.  The public battle between Taylor Swift and music manager Scooter Braun continues to escalate. Swift claims Braun and Scott Borchetta, the head of her former music label, Big Machine Label Group, are pressuring her not to record "copy cat versions" of her songs and to stop speaking about them publicly, and, in exchange "allow her" to use parts of her older catalog at the upcoming American Music Awards and in a Netflix documentary about her life. In a statement to CNN, an executive at Big Machine Label Group disputed Swift's claims. "Taylor Swift can 100% perform all of her catalog, past and present, on the AMAs.  Marie Kondo rose to fame by urging people to rid their homes of items that don't "spark joy." Now, she's recommending products that do just that, at least for her. The star of the Netflix series "Tidying Up with Marie Kondo" has launched an online shop on her website, KonMari.com, which carries products that "spark joy for Marie." There are more than 100 products for sale including a Shiatsu Stick ($12) handcrafted by Japanese woodworkers and a pair of leather slippers ($206) handmade in Tokyo.
