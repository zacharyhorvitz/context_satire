 Bill Clinton -- 20 years on from an affair with a White House intern that led to his impeachment by the House -- said Monday that he didn't owe Monica Lewinsky an apology. "No, I do not," the former president responded to a question from NBC's Craig Melvin about whether he believed he should personally apologize to Lewinsky. "I have never talked to her. But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.  Former President Bill Clinton used the opening of a book tour event in New York on Monday to respond to a defensive interview he gave NBC News in which he defended his handling of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and said that he didn't have to apologize to her. Asked by author Walter Mosley about the response, Clinton said, "The truth is, the hubbub was I got hot under the collar because of the way the questions were asked. And I think what was lost were the two points that I made that are important to me." "The suggestion was that I never apologized for what caused all the trouble for me 20 years ago," Clinton said.  Former President Bill Clinton has just revealed the ultimate lessons he's learned in the 20 years since his sordid affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky led to his impeachment: precisely, exactly none. That's right. Despite the supposed benefit of hindsight, Lewinsky's own accounting of how that affair nearly destroyed her life, and a new era that's seen the stunningly swift demise of accused sexual predators from Harvey Weinstein to Kevin Spacey, Clinton believes he did the right thing then, and isn't sorry now. In an interview with NBC News' Craig Melvin, Clinton told the host he didn't believe he owed Lewinsky an apology.
