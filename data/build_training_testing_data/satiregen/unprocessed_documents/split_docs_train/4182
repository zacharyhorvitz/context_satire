 If you're a Detroiter who needs a police officer, it will take 58 minutes to get help -- more than five times what it takes elsewhere in the United States. And if you're walking around the city, it might make sense to bring a flashlight -- about 40% of the 88,000 street lights don't work. Those are two of the problems highlighted by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder as he approved a bankruptcy filing for the state's biggest city.  Detroit is known as the Motor City, but perhaps it should be known as Blackjack City. It's the city's three casinos that are now crucial to keeping the cash-strapped government functioning during bankruptcy. Most of the auto industry's Michigan plants are outside of city limits, severely limiting how much tax revenue they contribute to Detroit. General Motors is the only automaker with headquarters inside of city limits, and Chrysler Group operates just one plant inside the city.  Detroit filed for bankruptcy Thursday, becoming the nation's largest public sector bankruptcy. The move could slash pension benefits to city workers and retirees, and leave bond holders with only pennies on the dollar. The bankruptcy was filed by Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr and approved by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder.
