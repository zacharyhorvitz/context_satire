O'Grady had gained experience as a daytime television presenter by standing in for Des O'Connor in nine episodes of ITV's lunchtime chat show Today with Des and Mel. Having got on well with co-presenter Melanie Sykes, he enjoyed the feeling of presenting live. ITV executives deemed this such a success that they offered him his own daytime chat show, with news of his agreement going public in autumn 2004; the result would be The Paul O'Grady Show. There was initial press scepticism and concern that O'Grady's style of adult humour would not be appropriate for a daytime slot, but ITV's controller of entertainment, Mark Wells, declared that "Paul is one of the funniest people on television – he deserves to be on it far more than he is." In December 1940, the case against her was heard in camera at the Hampshire Assizes, Winchester. As there was no indication as to just how the information gathered by O’Grady was to have been communicated to the Germans she was tried not as a spy or agent, but as a saboteur. O'Grady used his act to publicly speak out against the treatment of Britain's LGBT community by the mainstream media, government and police, particularly during the HIV/AIDS crisis that hit the community during that decade. On a number of occasions, police raided pubs that he was working at; he was quoted in the Capital Gay newspaper as calling on LGBT people to riot against their mistreatment. In April 1988 he took part in a 30,000 strong march against Section 28, a policy introduced by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher that the gay community denounced as homophobic. Regularly doing charity fundraisers for HIV/AIDS research, many of his friends died as a result of AIDS-related complications.
