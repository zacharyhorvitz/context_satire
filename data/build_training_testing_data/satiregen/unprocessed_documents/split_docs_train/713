 Italy's new prime minister presented lawmakers with his proposal for €30 billion ($41 billion) in new taxes and spending cuts Monday, saying the "painful measures" would end the country's budget crisis. "We are aware that the measures mean sacrifices. But not making the sacrifices today would mean making more painful ones in a few weeks, maybe even in a few days," Prime Minister Mario Monti told the lower house of Parliament Monday, a day after his Cabinet adopted what he has dubbed a "Save Italy" decree. About €20 billion would come from cuts, including major changes to how Italian workers' pensions are calculated and a one-year increase in retirement ages, effective in January, Monti announced. The Independent Treasury was the system for managing the money supply of the United States federal government through the U.S. Treasury and its sub-treasuries, independently of the national banking and financial systems. It was created on August 6, 1846 by the 29th Congress, with the enactment of the Independent Treasury Act of 1846 (ch. 90, 9 Stat. 59), and it functioned until the early 20th century, when the Federal Reserve System replaced it.  Just one decade after the European single currency was launched amid fanfare and fireworks, its future looks uncertain as the debt crisis that engulfed Greece, Ireland and Portugal threatens the entire bloc -- and the wider global economy. Spain, the bloc's fourth-largest economy, is the latest country to be swept into the crisis. In June, it was forced to seek up to €100 billion in aid from its eurozone peers  to shore up its banking sector. Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy said the deal had demonstrated the advantages of cooperation within the bloc and meant "European credibility won, the future of the euro won  Europe won."
