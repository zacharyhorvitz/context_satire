Prior to his death, Best's former Dukes of Hazzard co-star and long-time friend, John Schneider, said; "I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year." He also added that, when asked to cry for the camera, "(Best) would say, 'sure thing, which eye?' I'm forever thankful to have cut my teeth in the company of such a fine man." Nearly one year after Best's death, Schneider said about his working relationship with Best: "He was amazing in everything he did; he was not just a funny guy. Each Mr. Bill episode would start innocently enough but would quickly turn dangerous for Mr. Bill. Along with his dog, Spot, he would suffer various indignities inflicted by "Mr. Hands," a man seen only as a pair of hands (originally performed by Vance DeGeneres). Anderson has stated that the reason the nickname "Busta" became so prevalent in his life is because his mom, Rhonda Anderson called him "Buster" at a very young age.
