 A winter storm is snarling travel across the East Coast on Wednesday, causing trouble on the nation's roadways and delays of up to six hours at airports in the Northeast on one of the busiest travel days of the year. About 30 million people from the mountains of North Carolina to Maine could be affected by the holiday storm. "The storm in the Northeast continues to develop and is causing long delays and numerous cancellations at D.C., New York city and Philadelphia airports, along with trouble on the roadways, as snow increases in coverage," CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. "Most delays and cancellations will occur from late morning through Wednesday evening." LaGuardia Airport (IATA: LGA, ICAO: KLGA, FAA LID: LGA)  is an airport in Queens, New York. The airport is the third busiest airport serving New York City, and the twentieth busiest in the United States. LaGuardia Airport covers 680 acres (280 ha).In 2016, LaGuardia Airport had a strong growth in passenger traffic; about 29.8 million passengers used the airport, a 14.2 percent increase from the previous year. It is a hub for both American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.  Please don't try to clear airport security at Thanksgiving wearing your loaded firearm. That's not allowed, and it could slow down the lines during one of the busiest travel days of the year. That's what a 94-year-old Brooklyn man discovered as he tried to pass through passenger screening at New York's LaGuardia Airport on Wednesday, security officials said. Transportation Security Administration officers detected the gun attached to the man's belt at the small of his back he entered the checkpoint body scanner.
