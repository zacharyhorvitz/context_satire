In 1999, she and her partner Linda Chapman performed in a play they wrote called Gertrude & Alice: A Likeness to Loving, based on the relationship between Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. "I've always loved Gertrude Stein and felt that as a gay woman, I understood her in a way that many biographers did not,"  Pashalinski told journalist Simi Horowitz for a profile published in Backstage in 2005. "I wanted to explode the myth of what Stein was about... and the play gave me the chance to work with Linda." Kate Valk was born on March 7, 1956 in Spokane, Washington. Her mother was a nurse, while her father was a jack-of-all-trades; he worked, at various times, at a cement company, a post office, a remodeling company, and on real estate ventures. They moved consistently during her childhood, including to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. This lower-middle-class childhood did not give her much exposure to the arts. Born and raised in Alpharetta and Cumming, Georgia, she is the daughter of Andrea (Elvey) and Webb Redmond, a former marine and police officer. Her parents are divorced, both remarried, and she has 6 siblings/step siblings between them. She attended South Forsyth High School where she was involved with theatre. In 2006 she won a Breakthrough Performance Award at the Georgia One-Act competition.
