In June 2013 Governor of Michigan Rick Snyder and the Michigan Legislature approved Public Act 96 and 97 of 2013. The two bills were written specifically to close Inkster Public Schools and Buena Vista School District. The laws gave Andy Dillon, the Michigan Treasurer, and Mike Flanagan, the State Superintendent of Education, the power to formally determine if the districts would remain open for the 2013-2014 school year. They told the districts that they had one final opportunity to remain open if they secured outside funding but neither received a financing agreement. The Prestons are a typical modern-day family with modern-day situations: widowed father Richard is a realtor, though he retired a few months after and began working as a licensing agent for new inventors; older son Duane is very class-conscious; daughter Lissy is very opinionated; Jay Jay, the youngest, just wants someone who can fill their late mother's void. It is Jay Jay's prayer for an angel to come into their lives that summons Ethel, and he is the only one who knows her true identity. In 1798, John Carlysle Stewart, a civil engineer, traveled to western Pennsylvania to resurvey the "donation lands," which had been reserved for veterans of the Revolutionary War. He discovered that the original survey had neglected to stake out approximately 50 acres (20Â ha) at the confluence of the Shenango River and the Neshannock Creek, at that time a part of Allegheny County. The Indian town of Kuskusky was listed on early maps in this location. Claiming the land for himself, he laid out what was to become the town of New Castle.
