 The thought of President Donald Trump hand-in-hand with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, smiling over how great the debt deal is going to be, shocks establishment Republicans and people inside the Beltway who've lived with the ideal of party loyalty all their lives. The big news for them isn't the deal itself, but Trump's break with his own allies on the Hill. Does he still not know how things are done? But it should have been clear from early in the campaign that a victory for Trump would not spell triumph for the Republicans.  President Donald Trump's longtime aide and current director of Oval Office operations Keith Schiller has told people he intends to leave the White House, three sources familiar with the decision told CNN. Schiller has told associates within the last two weeks that he plans to leave the White House at the end of September or in early October, the sources said. Schiller has told people his primary reason for leaving was financial, the sources said. Schiller earns a $165,000 annual salary at the White House -- a downgrade from his annual earnings before he followed Trump to the White House. The prosecution case was that Bamber, motivated by hatred and greed, had left White House Farm around 10 pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, to drive to his home in Head Street, Goldhanger. Later, perhaps in the early hours of the morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother's bicycle—which he had borrowed a few days earlier—cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the house from the back. He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs.
