 With the Grammys going on for 3Â½ hours Sunday night, Trent Reznor thinks the telecast could've spared a few extra minutes for his performance. The Nine Inch Nails rocker was part of the final closing act at the Grammys -- a set that included Dave Grohl, Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham and Josh Homme -- but fans didn't get to see the entire number. The producers decided to cut the group off before they were done and start rolling credits. "Music's biggest night... to be disrespected," Reznor tweeted after the show.  It was a "Lucky" night for Daft Punk. The robot-headed duo won record of the year for the hit "Get Lucky" and album of the year for "Random Access Memories" at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards Sunday night. Daft Punk was typically silent, but singer-songwriter Paul Williams accepted the album of the year award with a generous speech. Williams, who's written such songs as "We've Only Just Begun" and "Evergreen," had struggled to overcome substance abuse problems over the years.  Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, the two surviving members of the Beatles, will get back together to play the star-studded "The Night That Changed America: A Grammys Salute to The Beatles," Starr said Monday. "To celebrate the 50 years since we landed in New York in February (1964), they're putting on a big show on Monday and we'll be doing it there," he told "Access Hollywood" on Monday at a David Lynch Foundation event. Starr was being honored by the Lynch Foundation with its Lifetime of Peace and Love Award. The Recording Academy, which oversees the Grammy Awards, had already said that McCartney and Starr would both be performing at the Grammys Sunday night -- though the question of whether they'll be performing together is still unconfirmed.
