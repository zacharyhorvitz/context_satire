 The killing of 6-month-old Jonylah Watkins has been held up as a new low in Chicago's struggle to keep senseless death off its streets, as a rallying cry to do something about gun violence and as proof that no one -- even the most innocent among us -- is safe. On Tuesday, it was also about Jonylah. Hundreds braved the cold on the city's South Side, standing in a line that wrapped around the New Beginnings Church as they waited to pay their respects. Some people, many of whom had never met Jonylah or her family, broke down in tears when her hearse passed by.  As hundreds of teachers took to Chicago’s streets Wednesday to protest the closure of 54 public schools, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Public School CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett refused to negotiate. The consolidation of many of the city’s schools is necessary, they argue, as classrooms are half-empty and CPS faces a $1 billion budget deficit. Byrd-Bennett joins “Starting Point” on Thursday to discuss the city’s efforts to consolidate schools and to improve education for Chicago’s students. “Our guarantee is that no child will go to a school that is lesser performing than the school that they’re in,” Byrd-Bennett explains, adding that for many years students have been “trapped in under-utilized and under-resourced schools.”  The consolidation plan has come under fire for potentially endangering students that will have to travel farther to attend their new schools.
