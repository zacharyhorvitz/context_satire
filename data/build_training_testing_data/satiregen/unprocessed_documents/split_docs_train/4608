Mally Beauty is a makeup company founded by Mally Roncal, former makeup artist of many A-list celebrities. The makeup brand claims to be a long-wearing makeup line for the everyday, working woman. Since 2005, Mally Beauty has created a line of over 1,000 products, with the brand expanding to retailers, such as Ulta Beauty and QVC. In 2015, a Youtuber from the UK, Em Ford, posted a video named “You Look Disgusting”. The video talks about the surrounding negative comments to her, for humanizing people behind the screens to end any kind of language bully. So far, as in October 2018, the video has been viewed more than 28 million times. There was a post from Huda that been blamed for shaming other peer Youtubers’ acne scars. Ultimately, Ulta Beauty was designed for customers to go into freestanding stores, such as found in strip malls, that allow them to feel comfortable shopping in a makeup store, with no workers handing out samples. In 1994, Ulta had a makeover that eliminated products and items that were typical of drugstores, such as toothbrushes and vitamins. The store moved strictly to beauty products. In 1999, Ulta Beauty changed its name from Ulta3, changing the brand almost entirely.
