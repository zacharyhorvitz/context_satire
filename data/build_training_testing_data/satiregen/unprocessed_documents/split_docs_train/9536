Miyazaki based some of the buildings in the spirit world on the buildings in the real-life Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. He often visited the museum for inspiration while working on the film. Miyazaki had always been interested in the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, "especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting – tears well up in my eyes."  High-level radiation hot spots can be detected at a sports complex in Japan's northeastern Fukushima prefecture, where the 2020 Tokyo Olympics torch relay will kick off next year, according to a report by environmental group Greenpeace. The study, published on Wednesday, revealed that radiation levels around the J-Village sports camp were over 1,700 times higher than prior to the 2011 massive earthquake and tsunami that triggered the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. J-Village is home to a 5,000-capacity stadium, 11 soccer fields, a gym, swimming pool, and hotel and conference center. It is around 12 miles (20 kilometers) south of the now-disabled nuclear plant. The storyboard depicts the town of Matsuko as the setting, with the year being 1955; Miyazaki stated that it was not exact and the team worked on a setting "in the recent past". :33 The film was originally set to be an hour long, but throughout the process it grew to respond to the social context including the reason for the move and the father's occupation. :54
