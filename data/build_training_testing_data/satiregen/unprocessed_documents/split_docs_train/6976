 The CIA has become the preeminent hacking operation, sneaking into high-tech phones and televisions to spy on people worldwide, according to an explosive WikiLeaks publication of purported internal CIA documents on Tuesday. To hide its operations, the CIA routinely adopted hacking techniques that enabled them to appear as if they were hackers in Russia, WikiLeaks said. WikiLeaks also claimed that nearly all of the CIA's arsenal of privacy-crushing cyberweapons have been stolen, and the tools are potentially in the hands of criminals and foreign spies. WikiLeaks claimed the stolen tools ended up in the hands of "former U.S. government hackers and contractors... one of whom" leaked documents to WikiLeaks.  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange says he wants to give details about stolen CIA hacking tools to tech companies so they can patch security holes. Assange made the offer during a press conference Thursday. He said WikiLeaks has "a lot" of unpublished information about CIA hacking and spying that the organization will release if the tech companies fix security gaps.

The CIA allegedly created tools to spy on people through smart TVs and other household technologies, according to documents released by WikiLeaks. But security researchers say the methods imitate exploits that were discovered -- and made public -- years ago. The leaked documents that Wikileaks claims are from the CIA, dubbed "Vault 7," contain notes about how the agency allegedly targeted individuals through malware and physical hacking on devices including phones, computers and TVs. Federal officials are investigating the leak.
