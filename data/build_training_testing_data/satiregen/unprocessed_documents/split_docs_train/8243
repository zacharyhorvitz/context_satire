Pennsylvania ( (listen) PEN-səl-VAY-nee-ə), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the Northeastern, Great Lakes, Appalachian, and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The Commonwealth is bordered by Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east. Pennsylvania is the 33rd-largest state by area, and the 5th-most populous state according to the most recent official U.S. Census count in 2010.  William Holden, Alec Guinness, George C. Scott, Denzel Washington: They all won Academy Awards for roles as heroic military men. But when James Maitland Stewart enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1941, he already had a Best Actor Oscar to his name, for his indelible performance as reporter Mike Connor in "The Philadelphia Story." Based in England during much of his service, Jimmy Stewart flew dozens of combat missions -- more than a few as command pilot -- on sorties deep into Nazi-occupied Europe and returned from the war with honors that included the Distinguished Flying Cross and Distinguished Service Medal. In September 1945, LIFE photographer Peter Stackpole accompanied Stewart around his Indiana, Pennsylvania, hometown, chronicling the goings-on when the movie star returned home a hero.
