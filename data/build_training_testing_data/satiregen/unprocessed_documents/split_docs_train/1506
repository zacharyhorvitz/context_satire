 Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, said Sunday he was seriously considering a run for president as a "centrist independent." While we are both former elected officials of the two traditional parties, we feel passionately that Americans need an independent option. We aren't endorsing Schultz, but we are encouraged that a candidate closer to the center of the political spectrum may run. The only problem is that Schultz or someone like him stands almost no chance.  Democratic presidential candidate Juli√°n Castro said Sunday that should former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz run for president as an independent, he would give President Donald Trump the "best hope of getting re-elected." Last week, CNN reported that two people familiar with Schultz's thinking said the businessman is exploring a 2020 presidential run as an independent. After he stepped down from his position at Starbucks last year, Schultz said at the time that he may consider a White House bid. "I have a concern that if he did run, that essentially, it would provide Donald Trump with his best hope of getting re-elected," Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union."  Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, is exploring running for president as an independent candidate, two people familiar with his thinking told CNN. A person close to Schultz's advisers said they "are exploring a possible independent bid for the presidency in 2020," but the person emphasized that all options remained on the table. "(Schultz) is thinking deeply about his future and how he can best serve the country," the person said. Schultz stepped down from his position at Starbucks last year, and he said at the time he may consider a White House bid.
