 There are going to be a lot more seats available for you to fly on this year. And that is spooking investors to climb out of airline stocks. More flights and larger planes can put downward pressure on fares, a basic rule of supply and demand. But airlines seem to looking past that lesson, rushing to add capacity to try to grab market share and take advantage of a strong economy.  Passengers flying on American Airlines who get stranded at an airport because of weather or a maintenance problem can now get a seat booked on Delta -- and vice versa. It's all part of a new agreement that lets the airlines re-book passengers on the other carrier's flights in the event of a disruption, like a blizzard, computer outage or aircraft breakdown. The aim is to move stranded passengers out of airports and on to their destinations as quickly as possible. A Delta spokesman called the new agreement "a tool that will give our employees more options to reacommodate customers whose flights are canceled during weather and other uncommon scenarios when Delta flights are canceled." During World War II United-trained ground crews modified airplanes for use as bombers, and transported mail, material, and passengers in support of the war effort. The airline was quite busy covering the need for air transport across the United States during the war. Its fleet of fifty aircraft were utilized at a rate of more than thirteen hours per day by 1945 (well above the pre-war rate of less than nine hours per day), flying 100,000 miles per day. Post-war United benefited from new technologies (like the pressurized cabin which permitted planes to fly above the weather) and a boom in customer demand for air travel.
