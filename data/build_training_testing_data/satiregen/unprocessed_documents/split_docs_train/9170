This ran counter to his father's original decision, as Mark Goodson was loyal to Combs from the moment that he hired him and had refused to even consider Dawson due to the trouble he caused for the production staff of the original series. Many members of the original production staff were also working on the revival series and held lingering negative feelings toward Dawson. However, Jonathan Goodson did not have the ties to Combs that his father did, and felt that the change had to at least be necessary in order to keep the production intact. He was born in Dallas, Texas; his father Pinkie Dawson was the leader of a western swing band, the Manhattan Merrymakers. The family moved to Waxahachie. He learned to play guitar, bass and drums. He attended the Southern Bible Institute in Waxahachie before he was expelled. Dawson used to smoke almost four packs of cigarettes per day, and he could even be seen smoking on some episodes of Match Game, Family Feud and multiple episodes of Hogan's Heroes. His daughter Shannon got him to stop smoking by 1994, when he was aged 61.
