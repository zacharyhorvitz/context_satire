On September 4, 2014, a 14-year-old girl in Port Richey, Florida, allegedly set her family's house on fire while her mother and nine-year-old brother were inside. Police reported that the teenager had been reading online stories about Slender Man as well as Atsushi Ōkubo's manga Soul Eater. Eddie Daniels of the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said the girl "had visited the website that contains a lot of the Slender Man information and stories  It would be safe to say there is a connection to that." On the morning of August 14, 2016, Lochte and Jimmy Feigen falsely stated that they and teammates Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger were robbed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the 2016 Summer Olympics after men forced them out of their taxi at gunpoint in the early morning hours. Lochte also falsely claimed that a gun had been put up against his head. A police report stated that one or more of the athletes had vandalized the gas station bathroom and damaged a sign on the premises, though investigative reporters found that the athletes had damaged the sign but had neither entered the bathroom nor damaged items in the bathroom. Lochte later stated in an interview that he had been drunk and that he "over-exaggerated that story". Most of the children oppose the union at first, regarding each other and their respective stepparents with suspicion. The voice overs as Helen walks down the aisle at the wedding are particularly funny: "She has mean eyes!". Eventually, however, the 18 children bond into one large blended family, about to increase—Helen becomes pregnant. While she learns about it on Christmas Day, she says nothing so that Frank can ship out to test the new landing system with Darrell.
