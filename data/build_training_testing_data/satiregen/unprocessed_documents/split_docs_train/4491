In August 2019, Sanders said that The Washington Post did not "write particularly good articles" about him and suggested that it was because he frequently mentioned that Amazon, The Washington Post's parent company, did not pay taxes. Marty Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post, responded, "Contrary to the conspiracy theory the senator seems to favor, Jeff Bezos allows our newsroom to operate with full independence, as our reporters and editors can attest." The day the official entry list for Worlds was posted, it was announced that Chris was stepping away from the sport, citing ongoing "bouts of depression" that had come to a head at the Four Continents Championships. It was also announced that Knierim would be seeking a new partner to continue skating, saying as well that "I'm his wife over being his partner. We know skating ends and life continues. For us, our marriage, our relationship is what's important." In April 2019, Sanders wrote to the board of the Center for American Progress in response to a video produced by their former media outlet ThinkProgress. The video mocked him for becoming a millionaire after writing a book about his 2016 election run. The following month, Politico published a feature article on Sanders's income. Both the article and tweets from official Politico accounts on Twitter promoting the text, described him as "rich" and "cheap"; the article itself also contained a montage of a giant Sanders holding three houses.
