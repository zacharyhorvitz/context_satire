The Fitbit Charge 3, a wristwatch-like health and fitness tracker introduced in October 2018, was the first device to feature an oxygen saturation (SPO2) sensor - however, it is non-functional and Fitbit has yet to give a timeline for the feature to be enabled. This is creating significant customer backlash as of January 2019. The device has a touchscreen display, goal-based exercise modes and some smart features. The Fitbit Alta HR was released in March 2017. It has an added heart rate monitor. It includes the new Sleep Stages feature, which intends to show the stages of sleep, rather than just time asleep as in previous versions. Announced in October 2014, the Surge was a smartwatch and an activity tracker. It features a heart-rate monitor and the ability to track pace, distance, and elevation using the GPS on the device. The Surge also can send alerts of text and incoming calls from a connected smartphone.
