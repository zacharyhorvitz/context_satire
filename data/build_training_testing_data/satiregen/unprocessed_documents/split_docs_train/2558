His personal life is also shrouded in mystery. Though Carlo has two sons, Jason (who is seen on the show) and James (who is not), Carlo's wife (if he has one) is never seen by the audience, or even mentioned, nor is Carlo ever seen with a comare or mistress. When Bobby Baccala is robbed and he is wounded, forced to wear an eyepatch, Carlo refers to Bobby looking like Captain Haddock from The Adventures of Tintin, mistaking Haddock for the eye-patch wearing character, Piotr Skut which leads people to believe he read the comic books. This is in stark contrast to the rest of Tony's crew, all of whom but Paulie have significant others or families who are regularly shown. Elliot once unknowingly encountered Tony Soprano in the parking garage at Columbia University, while both were visiting their daughters. He followed Tony in his car in the hopes of taking Tony's parking space when he left but annoyed Tony by driving too closely, describing him later to Melfi in a therapy session as "this Bluto-type guy." He presented the encounter to Melfi as a way of saying that parking garages are not inherently dangerous places and that she should not blame herself for her rape. He thought that Tony may have been a maintenance man working in the building. In the series finale, Gervasi's son was picked up by the FBI for drug dealing. Gervasi failed to show up for a meeting with Paulie Gualtieri, which worried Tony Soprano that he may have been cutting a deal. Soprano's attorney confirmed that someone was, in fact testifying before a grand jury and that indictments were forthcoming. In the final scene, Tony told Carmela that Carlo was testifying, thus confirming that he turned informant, likely to keep his son out of jail.
