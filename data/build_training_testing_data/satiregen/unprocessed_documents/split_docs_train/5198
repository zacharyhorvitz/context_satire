In 2018 it was announced that the airline was introducing new routes from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to Aruba and between Curaçao and Kingston, Jamaica. These new services add to the airline's nonstop flights to Tortola, St. Maarten and Providenciales, Turks and Caicos, reported Caribbean Journal (CJ). The announcement came from interCaribbean's Chairman and Founder Lyndon Gardiner, and the airline's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Executive Director Trevor Sadler. “At interCaribbean Airways, we know that the Dominican Republic currently leads the region as an economic engine and as a strategic commercial and business point,” said Sadler in a recent presentation to stakeholders. In 2003, his first season of competition with Robert Yates, Sadler won the pole at both Darlington Raceway and Talladega Superspeedway, and finished 22nd in points. That year, he had a vicious crash at Talladega after near-contact with Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and touched the right-front fender of Kurt Busch. His car flew into the air, flipped twice, landed on his roof, spun towards the banking, and flipped six times. Sadler emerged uninjured.
