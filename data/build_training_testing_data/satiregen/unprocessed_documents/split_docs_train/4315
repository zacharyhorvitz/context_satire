The Art Institute of Chicago was founded in 1879. The Art Institute of Chicago collects and preserves items of universal cultural and artistic value in support of public interest and education of the fine arts. The curation of the scroll presented at The Art Institute of Chicago explains that the scroll originated from the 21st Egyptian Dynasty, 1070-946 BC also known as the Third Intermediate Period. The scroll was part of the exhibit; When the Greeks Ruled Egypt. The growth of the collection has warranted several additions to the museum's original 1893 building, which was constructed for the World's Columbian Exposition of the same year. The most recent expansion, the Modern Wing designed by Renzo Piano, opened in 2009 and increased the museum's footprint to nearly one million square feet, making it the second-largest art museum in the United States, after the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Art Institute is associated with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, a leading art school, making it one of the few remaining unified arts institutions in the United States. In FebruaryÂ 1989, a student named "Dread" Scott Tyler spread a Flag of the United States on the floor of the Institute as part of a piece entitled What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag? The piece consisted of a podium, set upon the flag, and containing a notebook for viewers to express how they felt about the exhibit. In order for viewers to write in the notebook, they would have to walk on the flag, which is a violation of customary practice and code.
