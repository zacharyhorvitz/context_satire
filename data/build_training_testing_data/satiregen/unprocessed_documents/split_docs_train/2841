 President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney step into a more free-wheeling town-hall style debate on Tuesday night, a setting that has given the two coolly intellectual candidates some trouble in the past. Both will have to recalibrate their approaches from their first encounter on Oct. 3, which was won by Romney. "I think Obama assumes he will do better in town hall debates because he has an advantage on empathy," said Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie, adding that Obama is going to have to "show a little more passion and fire in his belly." Five things to watch for in tonight's debate Romney could be less aggressive, which earned him points in the first debate, and focus more on trying to narrow the likability gap.  We are just hours away from tonight's Vice Presidential Debate. For the first time since the matchup against Mitt Romney, President Obama is admitting his performance may have left something to be desired, on account of what people were saying in the last week. "Gov. Romney had a good night," Obama said in a sit down with ABC News.  This morning on "Starting Point with Soledad O'Brien," Obama Campaign senior advisor David Axelrod previews the vice presidential debates, saying that Vice President Joe Biden is looking forward to it and the pressure will be on Rep. Ryan to explain details. “One feature of this debate that will be interesting is a few weeks a go, Soledad, Congressman Ryan was on television and when he was asked to explain how they’re going to pay for this $5 trillion tax cut for the wealthy, he said, "Well, it’s too complicated in this short period of time." Well, now he has 90 minutes to do it so perhaps he’ll use his time that way,” Axelrod says. Soledad also asks about Romney’s proposed tax cut, and asks why Democrats continue to refer to it as a “$5 trillion tax cut for the wealthy” even though some analysts say it's not true.
