 They are the images we can't unsee -- the torches on a college campus and the moment of a car's impact in Charlottesville, the crime scene tape and the vehicles of first responders in Pittsburgh and Thousand Oaks, the swastikas painted on community centers and the screenshots after the fact of dark threats lodged or warning signs missed on social media.

It may not look so different from what we see in a World War II documentary or an educational curriculum about the Holocaust, wrote Jill Filipovic, but there it was in a photograph, gone viral this week, of Wisconsin high school students giving an apparent Nazi salute before their prom: "a terrifying sight," contended Filipovic, because "right-wing terrorism, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic terrorism, is the biggest domestic terror threat Americans now face." If a picture speaks a thousand words, then the numbers don't lie.
