When Harvey Weinstein was charged with handling the U.S. release of Princess Mononoke, director Hayao Miyazaki was reported to have sent him a samurai sword in the mail. Attached to the blade was a stark message: "No cuts." Miyazaki commented on the incident: "Actually, my producer did that. Although I did go to New York to meet this man, this Harvey Weinstein, and I was bombarded with this aggressive attack, all these demands for cuts.  For the first time in more than a year and only weeks before his sex crimes trial, Harvey Weinstein has spoken out publicly, calling himself a "forgotten man." In an exclusive interview with the New York Post, Weinstein refused to speak about the allegations against him, according to the newspaper. He said he agreed to do the interview to prove that he hasn't been exaggerating about his ailments. Weinstein arrived at a hearing last week looking frail and using a walker, and his attorney Donna Rotunno said in court that her client was scheduled to have back surgery.  Attorneys for one of Harvey Weinstein's alleged victims on Wednesday rejected a tentative deal between the disgraced movie producer, his bankrupt company and dozens of his accusers. A source with knowledge of the deal confirmed to CNN a tentative deal has been reached. In the agreement, which needs sign off from all parties and a bankruptcy court, Weinstein does not have to admit to any wrongdoing, according to the source. The source would not disclose the amount of the tentative deal, but according to The New York Times which first reported the deal, $25 million would go to his accusers.
