Brandon Foster (season 1â€“present) is the 16-year-old son of Stef and her ex-husband, Mike. He is one of Callie's love interests. He is very talented musically, specifically with the piano, and writes piano pieces which he presents for chances at scholarships. He has been shown to have an unsteady relationship with his father, Mike, due to the fact that Mike is a struggling alcoholic and has disappointed him many times through his childhood and teen years. Spies, first loves, phony birth certificates, and the preservation of endangered species, fueled the plots. One major storyline that never got resolved was Garrett blackmailing Sydney with the fact that he could prove she was swapped at birth with Sandy Swan (the birth certificate was phony). After making peace with Callie and Jimmy, they offered to help Sydney find the evidence to help her disprove it. The 65 episode run ended unsuspectingly with a (to be continued) sign, which it never was; leaving a lot of questions unanswered and a lot of viewers confused and disappointed. HistoryVeronica Landers, the unstable wife of Joshua Landers, was presumed dead when a body was found at the bottom of a lake along with her wedding ring. However, Veronica turned up alive at Genoa City Memorial Hospital, having undergone extreme facial reconstruction after a car accident that left her hideously disfigured. She was determined to recover and return to her husband. After tracking Joshua down, she called him on the phone, but she was shocked when a woman, Joshua's new wife, Nikki Newman, answered the phone.
