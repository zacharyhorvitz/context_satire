 Washington Gov. Jay Inslee will unveil a sweeping plan aimed at combating climate change on Friday that, if enacted, would mean a wholesale change to the way the United States builds buildings, manufactures cars and supplies the power grid and includes a proposal to cut US coal production by 2030. The plan, Inslee's first major policy rollout of his presidential campaign, would implement 100% clean energy standards in three key sectors of the American economy -- electricity, vehicles and new buildings -- and represents the major bet Inslee is placing on the importance of climate change to Democratic primary voters as he vies for a chance to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. "We as Americans face a choice. As of May 24, 2019, Inslee secured a place in the Democratic Presidential Debates by reaching the threshold of financial contributions from 65,000 individual donors and 1% support in DNC-approved polls needed for inclusion. He was the thirteenth candidate to "double qualify." Inslee subsequently requested that one such debate focus on climate change. In addition to rejecting the proposal, the Democratic National Committee reminded him that attempts to organize a debate privately would violate the exclusivity contract for candidates. The 2020 presidential campaign of Jay Inslee began when Inslee, the Governor of Washington, announced on March 1, 2019 that he would be running for the Democratic nomination. He was chair of the Democratic Governors Association for the 2018 election cycle and served as a co-chair of the United States Climate Alliance. He was the first governor to enter the 2020 race. Inslee's campaign centered around climate change and other environmental issues.
