Dwight Eisenhower High School is a public high school located in Decatur, Illinois. The school serves about 1200 students in grades 9 to 12 in Decatur Public Schools District 61. Students from this school were featured on The N's Student Body, a show on which students competed against other students from their crosstown rival, MacArthur High School, to see who could lose the most weight for a $25,000 grand prize. Eisenhower High School organizes its students into communities divided by class, and has instituted a mandatory school uniform policy along with MacArthur High School. Eisenhower's Key Club was formed in 1973. During the 2008-2009 school year, Key Club, for the first time in its history, was awarded the honored title of "Diamond-Level Distinguished" (the highest honor a Key Club may receive). IKE was one of the two Michigan Key Clubs to receive the title that year. Eisenhower High School is named after Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower, who was the 34th President of the United States and supreme military commander of Allied forces in the European Theater during World War II.
