Donald is a masculine given name derived from the Gaelic name DÃ²mhnall. This comes from the Proto-Celtic Dumno-ualos ("world-ruler" or "world-wielder"). The final -d in Donald is partly derived from a misinterpretation of the Gaelic pronunciation by English speakers, and partly associated with the spelling of similar-sounding Germanic names, such as Ronald. A short form of Donald is Don. Andrew Schnell (born November 1, 1991) is a professional squash player who represents Canada. He reached a career-high world ranking of World No. 60 in October 2016. Peggy March (born Margaret Annemarie Battavio, March 8, 1948 in Lansdale, Pennsylvania) is an American pop singer. In the United States, she is primarily known for her 1963 million-selling song "I Will Follow Him". Although she is sometimes remembered as a one-hit wonder, she continued to have success in Europe well into the 1970s.
