 Facing a trio of possible scandals that threaten to overwhelm his second term agenda, President Barack Obama on Thursday rejected calls for a special counsel to investigate Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups and declared he would fix any problems in government. "My concern is making sure that if there is a problem in the government that we fix it," Obama told a Rose Garden news conference with visiting Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. "That's my responsibility, and that's what we're going to do." A light rain suddenly turned heavier when Obama began speaking, symbolizing his political woes that prompted him to make a trio of moves this week intended to regain the momentum or at least halt the damage.  Secretly accessing phone records of journalists. IRS targeting of conservative groups. Misleading statements last year about the Benghazi terrorist attack. News headlines of the past week portray an administration engulfed in potential scandal, providing opponents of President Barack Obama with plenty of ammunition to try to derail his agenda in the early months of his second term.  CNN's Chief National Correspondent John King reports on the new developments unfolding in Washington D.C. with the IRS and the September 11, 2011 attack in Benghazi. President Obama's administration is fighting a battle on capital hill in regard to recent reports that the IRS targeted conservative tea party groups trying to get tax exempt status. The IRS agency's acting commissioner was forced to step down due to the targeting of conservative political groups. His pink slip may not be the last.
