In early 2018, it was announced that Metz would star in Breakthrough, working with producer DeVon Franklin. She is cast as Joyce Smith, the mother of John, a 14-year-old boy who fell through an icy Missouri lake and was proclaimed dead. The movie, based on the book written by Smith herself, tells the story of how a mother gives credit to God for bringing her son back to life through prayer. In 2014, Lapkus launched her own podcast on the Earwolf network, called With Special Guest Lauren Lapkus. The show's premise is that each week her guest is the host of their own podcast, and she is appearing as a character on their show. Her guests have included Paul F. Tompkins, Betsy Sodaro, Andy Daly, Nick Kroll, and Scott Aukerman. She has said that she "never expected to get into podcasts at all" and to her it is funny she has one. Metz has stated that her first job was at McDonald's in Gainesville, Florida so she could afford to purchase a $120 pair of sneakers that her mother wouldn't agree to pay for. She fondly recalls how her manager treated both her and her fellow employees with respect and dignity, and how she learned early on the benefits of hard work and the advantages one can gain from being nice to other people.
