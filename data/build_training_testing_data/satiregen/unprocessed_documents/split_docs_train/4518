During the general election, Humphrey faced former Vice President Richard Nixon of California, the Republican Party nominee. and Governor of Alabama George Wallace the American Independent Party nominee, Nixon led in most polls throughout the campaign, and successfully criticized Humphrey's role in Vietnam, connecting him to the unpopular president and the general disorder in the nation. Humphrey experienced a surge in the polls in the days prior to the election, largely due to incremental progress in the peace process in Vietnam and a break with the Johnson war policy, but was defeated by Nixon on Election Day.  The presidential race is entering a whole new ball game, according to at least one new poll. The Pew Research poll shows Republican Mitt Romney leading President Barack Obama 49% to 45%. Last month when President Obama was ahead the case was Pew talked to more Democrats than Republicans. Meanwhile, Gallup's daily tracking poll shows President Obama ahead of Mitt Romney by five points.  Need any more evidence that debates do matter in the presidential election? A slew of national polls and surveys from crucial swing states suggests that they do. President Barack Obama maintained a narrow lead over GOP challenger Mitt Romney in most national polls through the summer and had the advantage in battleground states that will determine the outcome of the election. But polls taken after Obama's lackluster performance in last week's first presidential debate indicate that Romney got a measurable bounce -- enough to put him in the lead in several national surveys and to tighten the race in some battlegrounds.
