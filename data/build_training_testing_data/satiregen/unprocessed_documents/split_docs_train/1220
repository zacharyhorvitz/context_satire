Leah Thomas of Cosmopolitan said "This soap opera drama series will have your jaw dropping with all the twists turns imaginable.

Though he started writing in Dagbladet as an economics writer in 1920, Hoff was well known for being an editor and writer in Farmand, a business magazine he bought in 1935. Hoff built Farmand to become the leading Norwegian business magazine of his time. At Farmand, he was well known for being an outspoken editor. He also made a clear policy that Farmand should be an apolitical body for the industry's freedom. The Comac Society was the second to be formed on Long Island, preceded only by Newton in 1768. However, the historic building we now call our 1789 Chapel, has the distinction of being the oldest Methodist Church in continuous use in New York in which people still worship in the original building, with but few alterations. For it was in 1789 during the pastorate of William Phoebus that James Hubbs and the community erected "a neat, substantial and commodious house of worship." Others active in the society at that time were Nehemiah Brush, Jacob Wheeler, Charles Peters, Joel Rogers and Jacob Hoff.
