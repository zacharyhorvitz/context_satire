In late 2003-early 2004 US Airways lobbied for lower operating fees at Pittsburgh International Airport, citing its economies of scale as the primary carrier and largest tenant at the airport. US Airways attempted to leverage its adverse cash position and "red ink" in the years following 9/11 to negotiate better financial terms with the airport. The Allegheny County Airport Authority rejected US Airways' demands for reduced landing fees and lower lease payments, in part due to antitrust and FAA regulations that required the airport operator to extend the same financial terms to all carriers if it accepted US Airways' demands. US Airways threatened to move traffic to rival hubs in Philadelphia and Charlotte, and the airline made good on its threat in November 2004, reducing its flights at Pittsburgh International Airport from primary-hub to secondary-hub status. On November 15, 2006, US Airways Group announced a proposal to purchase Delta Air Lines for $8.0 billion, half of this amount to be paid in cash with the remainder to be paid in stock. US Airways Group had obtained a firm commitment from Citibank to provide financing for both the cash portion of the merger offer, as well as the required secured loan refinancing at both airlines. The combined airlines would have flown under the Delta Air Lines name. Delta Air Lines repeatedly stated its intentions of exiting bankruptcy as a stand-alone carrier. Pittsburgh International Airport won a three-way competition between Phoenix and Charlotte in 2007 for the right to continue as US Airways' Global Flight Operations center. Opening in November 2008, US Airways invested more than $25 million ($29.7 million today) into a 72,000-square-foot (6,700Â m2) facility. It replaced a smaller 11-year-old (pre-merger) operations center closer to downtown Pittsburgh. The state-of-the-art Ops Center opened ahead of schedule and was home to approximately 600 employees.
