 Standing before this city's iconic Independence Hall, Pope Francis gave a ringing endorsement of religious freedom and immigration on Saturday, urging his American hosts to avoid a "superficial quest for unity." "In this witness, which frequently encounters powerful resistance," the Pope said, "you remind American democracy of the ideals for which it was founded, and that society is weakened whenever and wherever injustice prevails." Drawing cheers from the large crowd on Independence Mall, where many of the faithful waved flags from countries such as Costa Rica and Mexico, the Argentine-born Francis urged his diverse flock to "never be ashamed of your traditions." "Do not forget the lessons you learned from your elders," he said, "which are something you can bring to enrich the life of this American land."  Americans' wealth hit a record $85.7 trillion this spring, thanks mainly to the recovering housing market. But maybe you aren't feeling so flush? That's probably because the typical Americans' wages have stagnated for the past three years. It's yet another example of the nation's lopsided economic recovery.  A day after taking on price gouging by drug companies, Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan to help Americans' afford the rising cost of seeing the doctor. Under the Democratic presidential candidate's proposal, patients would be able to visit the doctor three times a year without having to meet their deductible first. Also, they could apply for a new tax credit of up to $5,000 if they face excessive costs, the campaign said Wednesday. "When Americans get sick, high costs shouldn't prevent them from getting better," Clinton said.
