Albany High was the only school in the Dougherty County School System to have an on-site football stadium; because of this, all the high schools in Dougherty County use Hugh Mills as a home field. To alleviate confusion during games between schools, signs are posted at each of the entrance gates to designate the home team. If the three schools have home games on the same weekend, games are played on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. On May 1, 2017, four Albany High students filed suit against the school arguing that they had been punished unfairly for their involvement with racist harassment on Instagram. The students and their lawyers claimed that the school had violated their First Amendment rights by punishing them for actions that took place outside of school grounds and outside of school hours. The complaints also stated that the students were refused protection by Jeff Anderson as a growing body of students gathered outside of the office where they were meeting for a restorative justice session. As the four students attempted to leave through their peers, two of the students were struck in the head by an enraged demonstrator, while others hid in a locked vehicle for safety, prompting complaints that the school mishandled the situation and allowed an unruly assembly to take place.
