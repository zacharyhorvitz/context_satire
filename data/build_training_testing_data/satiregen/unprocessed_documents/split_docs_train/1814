 Did you hear about the white woman who called police in Memphis earlier this month because a black man who wanted to buy a house was trying to take a look at it first? What about the white people who called the police on black people simply for sleeping in their own dorm lounge at Yale, barbecuing at a park, shopping at Nordstrom Rack, waiting in a Starbucks or ... the list goes tragically on and on. White women like me, we need to have a talk. Enough is enough and we need to make ourselves part of the solution.  Starbucks stores are now open to all â€” no purchase necessary. The company informed US employees on Friday that people can gather in their cafes and patios even if they don't buy drinks, and that store bathrooms are available to everyone. "Any person who enters our spaces, including patios, cafes and restrooms, regardless of whether they make a purchase, is considered a customer," Starbucks said in an email to employees. The policy change follows an uproar over the way two black men were treated at a Starbucks in Philadelphia last month.  Starbucks in recent days made it official: "Any customer is welcome" to spend time in its stores and use the restroom, even if they don't buy anything. But there are limits. Starbucks doesn't want its coffee shops to become public bathrooms. A company spokesperson stressed in an email to CNNMoney on Monday that it is asking all customers to behave in a way that "maintains a warm and welcoming environment."
