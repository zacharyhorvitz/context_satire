Produced by DreamWorks before the split and was released by Paramount after the new DreamWorks was formed. Distributed by Paramount Pictures and United International Pictures.

Paramount's most important property, however, was Star Trek. Studio executives had begun to call it "the franchise" in the 1980s due to its reliable revenue, and other studios envied its "untouchable and unduplicatable" success.
