Jiménez Vernís began exhibiting her work in 1957. She joined the Taller de Gráfica Popular (TGP) in 1963, when that organization was at its height, entering with friend Adolfo Quintero. What she liked about the TGP was the contact with workers, farmers and students that the artists had. Much of her work with the organization was related to making flyers and other announcements for political events and for unions. Swann is best known for her depictions of rural and indigenous life in Mexico, which she found to be a strong source of inspiration, linking their traditional values with her pictorial ones. Carlos Pellicer called her work a “case of spiritual fusion” and claimed that she “discovered Mexico’s indigenous soul.” Her work was well received in Mexico. For her first exhibit in Mexico Diego Rivera wrote, “The use of divided color that she brings about with insight and sensitivity is one of the qualities in her work that she should strive to retain.”  In 1950 Dr Atl noted that “This artist is essentially a luminist, because she paints with light, not in the manner of the Pointillists or the Futurists, but rather according to her own understanding, by creating genuine vibratory sensations in the spectator.”
