The Panic of 1907, which began in New York in October, followed on the heels of this frenetic reconstruction period. Several New York banks, deeply involved in efforts to manipulate the stock market, experienced a run when speculators were unable to pay for stock they had purchased. The run quickly spread to other New York banks, which were forced to suspend payment, and then to Chicago and the rest of the country. Wells Fargo lost $1 million in deposits weekly for six weeks in a row.  A fan of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers was removed from a preseason game against a Chinese team after he held signs and chanted in solidarity with pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The NBA is embroiled in a political firestorm that began when the general manager of the Houston Rockets expressed support for the protests against China's influence in Hong Kong. Sam Wachs, 33, told CNN he and his wife brought face masks and "Free Hong Kong" signs at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia for the game against the Guangzhou Loong Lions on Tuesday. Shortly after they held up the signs while sitting near the Chinese bench, security rushed to take the signs away, he said. In a March 2018 statement Wells Fargo said, "Any solutions on how to address this epidemic will be complicated. This is why our company believes the best way to make progress on these issues is through the political and legislative process. ... We plan to engage our customers that legally manufacture firearms and other stakeholders on what we can do together to promote better gun safety for our communities." Wells Fargo's CEO subsequently said that the bank would provide its gun clients with feedback from employees and  investors.
