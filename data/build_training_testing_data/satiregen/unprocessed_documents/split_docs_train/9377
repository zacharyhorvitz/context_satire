Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and, rarely, is visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a bit before dawn. The Romans (Latin: Rōmānī, Classical Greek: Rhōmaîoi) were a cultural group, variously referred to as an ethnicity or a nationality, that in Classical antiquity, from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD, came to rule most of the then known world – Europe, the Near East and Northern Africa – through conquests made during the Roman Republic and the later Roman Empire. The Romans themselves did not see being "Roman" as something based on shared language or inherited ethnicity, but saw it as something based on being part of the same larger religious or political community and sharing common customs, values, morals and ways of life. Initially, this larger community was the city of Rome itself, but as the land under Roman dominion continued to increase, citizenship was gradually granted to the various peoples under Roman rule. The number of Romans rapidly increased due to the creation of colonies throughout the empire, throgh grants of citizenship to veterans of the Roman army and through personal grants by the Roman emperors.  In New York, the bookstores have front of store displays: Meghan, An American Princess. Although we expect Meghan to be titled duchess after her marriage, she is still, strictly speaking, a princess. And as well as being American, she is also an intelligent, successful, self-made woman, a committed feminist, a UN women's advocate and a woman of color, who has spoken movingly and courageously about the prejudice she has experienced. It looks like it's time to change the princess narrative, once and for all.
