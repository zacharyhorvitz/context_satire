Captain Wallace was sure in his element now. It was 'Stand by!' the whole time, not knowing whether the sticks would go, but the splendid rigging and equipment of sails in the Cutty Sark stood the strain. We lost two brand new topgallant sails and one lower fore topsail. In December 1883, Cutty Sark departed Newcastle, New South Wales with 4,289 bales of wool and 12 casks of tallow, arriving in London in just 83 days. This was 25 days faster than her nearest rival that year and heralded the start of a new career taking Australian wool to Britain in time for the January wool sales. Cutty Sark is featured in the film Green Book, in which the character Don Shirley, played by Mahershala Ali, requires that his driver/bodyguard, Tony "Lip" Vallelonga, played by Viggo Mortensen, makes sure that a bottle of Cutty Sark is made available daily in his sleeping quarters. Don is seen frequently taking a drink from this bottle.
