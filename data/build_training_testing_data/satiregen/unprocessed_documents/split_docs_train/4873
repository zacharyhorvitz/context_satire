The term "foo" was borrowed from Smokey Stover by a radar operator in the 415th Night Fighter Squadron, Donald J. Meiers, who (it is agreed by most 415th members) gave the foo fighters their name. Meiers was from Chicago and was an avid reader of Holman's strip, which was run daily in the Chicago Tribune. Smokey Stover's catch-phrase was "where there's foo, there's fire". In a mission debriefing on the evening of November 27, 1944, Fritz Ringwald, the unit's S-2 Intelligence Officer, stated that Meiers and Ed Schleuter had sighted a red ball of fire that appeared to chase them through a variety of high-speed maneuvers. In 1988, Healy married actress Denise Welch but they divorced in 2012. The pair appeared together on an episode of Lily Savage's Blankety Blank in 2001. The couple have two sons, the elder of whom, Matthew, is frontman of alternative rock band The 1975. In February 2015, Healy announced that he is to marry his partner, Joan Anderton. When Healy's wife, Denise Welch, was a guest on The Paul O'Grady Show, an apparently aged man came on the show to talk about a subject. He sounded unwell while Welch was speaking, and to her and everyone's surprise, he revealed himself to be Healy. Healy starred in the third series of the ITV comedy Benidorm playing a cross dresser called Lesley. He later became a regular in the fourth series in 2011.
