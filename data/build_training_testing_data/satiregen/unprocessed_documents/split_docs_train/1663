 "Better safe than sorry." That was New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's message to New Yorkers on Tuesday morning as they woke up to just 7 inches of snow -- nothing compared to forecasts of an epic storm that could heap 2 to 3 feet on the City. De Blasio practically shut down the city and mobilized a massive city-wide response as New York braced for a blizzard that the National Weather Service called "life threatening" and "potentially historic." Heeding meteorologists' forecasts, de Blasio urged New Yorkers Monday to "prepare for something worse than we have seen before."  Snow totals may have fallen below expected levels in New York City, but once again the city that never sleeps delivered a sign language interpreter that didn't disappoint. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio took to television Monday to warn residents about the possible dangers associated with this week's winter storm. And he brought with him sign language interpreter Jonathan Lamberton, whose impressive delivery earned him social media fandom. Lamberton joined the mayor at several news conferences as the storm approached, and his personal flare first and most importantly served to warn New York's deaf community of the hazards expected in the days ahead.  In addition to Philadelphia, Pope Francis told reporters Monday that he will also visit New York and Washington on his upcoming trip to the United States. In September, he is scheduled to attend the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia. The trip will be the popular pontiff's first to the United States as Pope. Speaking on his flight back to Rome from the Philippines, he did not provide a detailed itinerary for the U.S. trip but said he planned to visit the United Nations and go to the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington.
