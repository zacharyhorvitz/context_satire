In 1995, Helford launched Mohawk Productions to produce shows created or executive produced by him. Mohawk is affiliated with Warner Bros. Television. Anger Management starring Charlie Sheen premiered in 2012 on cable channel FX. In 2016, Helford co-created the CBS sitcom Kevin Can Wait and served as the series' showrunner for the first thirteen episodes before leaving the show that November due to creative differences. The Fox News story fell apart within hours. Other news organizations quickly revealed the investigator was a Donald Trump supporter and had according to NBC News "developed a reputation for making outlandish claims, such as one appearance on Fox News in 2007 in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistol-toting lesbian gangs were raping young women." The family of Seth Rich, the Washington, D.C. police department, the Washington, D.C. mayor's office, the FBI, and law enforcement sources familiar with the case, rebuked the investigator's claims. The family said, "We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers." Robyn Bahr of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: "The episode couldn't have gone more smoothly, which is a feat for the production but actually somewhat of a letdown for the shark-like audience, constantly on the hunt for that little taste of blood... Overall, the cast and crew pulled off a flawless execution, which I attest to Helford's veteran producing skills and the trust between the castmembers, many of whom have been working together for more than 30 years. Goranson, in particular, is the MVP of the episode, delivering zinger after zinger with her signature serrated verve and impeccable timing. The next time The Conners attempts this format, I hope they inject a little more acid into the proceedings.
