 In an unusually direct move, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday called on Hillary Clinton to apologize to him for saying that his campaign is lying about her relationship with fossil fuel money. "Secretary Clinton owes us an apology. We were not lying. We were telling the truth," the Vermont senator said during a standard section of his stump speech here. In October 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that four FBI field offices—in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, and Little Rock—had been collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to determine whether "there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling". In a reported separate investigation, the Washington field office was investigating Terry McAuliffe before he became a board member of the Clinton Foundation. CNN reported in January 2018 that the FBI is investigating allegations of corruption at the Clinton Foundation in Arkansas. Sources said that federal prosecutors are checking to see if foundation donors were improperly promised policy favors or special access to Hillary Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state in return for donations and whether tax-exempt funds were misused by the foundation's leadership. The 2008 presidential campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton, then junior United States Senator from New York, was announced on her website on January 20, 2007. Hillary Clinton was previously the First Lady of the United States and First Lady of Arkansas prior to her election as U.S. Senator from New York. She is also the wife of former President Bill Clinton.
