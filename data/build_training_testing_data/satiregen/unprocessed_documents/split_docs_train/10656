There was a series of sequels, all of which feature Andrew Stevens on the role of Will Griffith. The first two (Night Eyes 2 and Night Eyes 3) feature Shannon Tweed in the lead female role, while the fourth one features Paula Barbieri. At Clinton's request, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed a special prosecutor, Robert B. Fiske, to investigate the legality of the Whitewater transactions in 1994. Two allegations surfaced: 1) that Clinton had exerted pressure on an Arkansas businessman, David Hale, to make a loan that would benefit him and the owners of Madison Guaranty; and 2) that an Arkansas bank had concealed transactions involving Clinton's gubernatorial campaign in 1990. In May 1994, Fiske issued a grand jury subpoena to the President and his wife for all documents relating to Madison Guaranty, with a deadline of 30 days. They were reported as missing by the Clintons. Issue #1 is the first Playboy video to feature a Playmate of the Year (PMOY) (1982's Shannon Tweed), and the first Video Centerfold (Lonny Chin, Playboy's January 1983 Playmate). Other segments in the first issue are an interview with John and Bo Derek, an erotic fiction short, a documentary look at historic moments in Playboy, a pictorial of actress Barbara Carrera, a look at the Playboy Jazz Festival, comedy shorts from Michael Nesmith, and a pictorial of the Crazy Horse Saloon dancers.
