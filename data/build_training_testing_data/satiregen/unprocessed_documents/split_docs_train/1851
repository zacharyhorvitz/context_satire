 As Moore, Oklahoma, struggles to regain its footing under the public spotlight, journalists from CNN are among those sharing online images of the devastation of a deadly tornado, as well as the rescue and recovery efforts there. But they're not alone. From rescue workers like the Red Cross to the Oklahoma County Sheriff's office to the governor of the state, regular citizens are taking to social media to share, as well, helping paint the picture of a tragedy that has captivated and saddened a nation. How to help Here is our roundup of social media images and messages coming out of Moore -- both from our own staff and others.  The massive tornado that devastated communities in Oklahoma Monday touched down near the town of Newcastle just five minutes after the first warnings went out, according to the National Weather Service. But residents of Moore, which would be hardest hit by the killer storm, had about 30 minutes before the twister entered the western part of the city, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said Tuesday. It sounds like enough time to act, but in the wake of tragedy, the question always persists: Could more have been done to warn residents of the monster tornado? The science and technology behind severe weather prediction continues to improve, and many of the tools in place were deployed during Monday's tornado. On the afternoon of the bombing, the New York Post reported that a suspect, a Saudi Arabian male, was under guard and being questioned at a Boston hospital. That evening, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said that there had not been an arrest. The Post did not retract its story about the suspect, leading to widespread reports by CBS News, CNN, and other media that a Middle Eastern suspect was in custody. The day after the bombing, a majority of outlets were reporting that the Saudi was a witness, not a suspect.
