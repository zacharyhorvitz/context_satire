 Beyonce fans who don't have subscriptions to Jay Z's streaming music service Tidal can take heart. "Lemonade" is now for sale via Apple's iTunes. The album appeared on the service during the early morning hours of Monday, and was selling for $17.99. The much-anticipated "visual album" was released exclusively on Tidal on Saturday night, but the New York Times reported Sunday that it would soon appear on iTunes and Amazon. After the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) announced Friday as the global record release day, Billboard's Andrew Flanagan thought the album release was among the influencing points in the decision, writing: "After seven months of semi-public back-and-forth, a conversation instigated in part by Aussie piracy and Beyonce's surprise release in December 2013 has resulted in the global recording industry accepting Friday as the release date for new albums." Time named Beyoncé as one of the most influential people of 2014 due to the album release, writing: "Beyoncé doesn't just sit at the table. She builds a better one. Today she sits at the head of the boardroom table at Parkwood Entertainment.  We finally know what Beyonce's mysterious "Lemonade" actually is. Using spoken word, fashion and lyrics about relationships, infidelity, empowerment and love, the singer presented her new music Saturday night in a series of stylized music videos. She told the story of a woman not to be trifled with. The "visual album" offered something the music world has never seen before.
