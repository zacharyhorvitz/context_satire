 As part of their fight against the opioid crisis, the US Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration have issued joint warning letters to several website operators illegally marketing and selling opioids. On Monday, the FDA and DEA announced that they sent warnings to four online networks, operating a total of 10 websites, which the agencies said are illegally marketing unapproved and misbranded versions of opioid medicines, including tramadol. These warning letters come just months after the FDA issued a similar series of warnings to other opioid-selling website operators. The online networks that received the new warning letters, sent earlier this month, are Divyata, Euphoria Healthcare Pvt Ltd., JCM Dropship and Meds4U.  Flavored e-cigarette use among young people in the United States increased from 2014 to 2018, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration. The report, released Thursday, said current use of flavored e-cigarettes -- defined as use in the past 30 days -- had increased among high school students since 2014 and among middle school students since 2015. Public health officials have called youth vaping an epidemic. The rates of eighth, 10th and 12th graders who use e-cigarettes continued to rise in 2019 and doubled from 2017 to 2019, according to research released last month.  Another state has announced plans to work toward banning the sale of certain e-cigarette products. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Tuesday called for a statewide ban on the sale of flavored vaping products, including mint and menthol. The ban will not include tobacco-flavored products, according to the governor's office.
