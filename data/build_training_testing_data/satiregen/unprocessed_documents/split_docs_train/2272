In April 2016, Trump vowed to bring "some showbiz" to the convention, criticizing the party's 2012 convention in Tampa, Florida, as "the single most boring convention I've ever seen." The convention's lineup of speakers lacked "many of the party's rising stars" and rather featured some of Trump's "eclectic collection of friends, celebrities and relatives." Politico reported that Trump was directly involved in details of convention plans, seeking "to maximize the drama and spectacle" of the four-night event. A large number of prominent Republican elected officials said they were not interested in attending the convention or even speaking at it, seeking to distance themselves from Trump.  Is the tea party changing the Republican Party from the inside -- or selling out to the GOP? As Republicans prepare to officially roll out Mitt Romney as their party's presidential nominee at the Republican National Convention this week, major tea party groups and figures have descended on Tampa, Florida, to schmooze with party bigwigs and rally for Romney. But Romney's conservative credentials have long been viewed with suspicion by the movement. So it came as a surprise when, before at least one event, tea party organizers committed what some activists would consider heresy: seeking approval from establishment Republicans to rally.  Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is behind enemy lines tonight. The co-chair of the Obama Campaign and chairman of the Democratic National Convention is on hand at the Republican National Convention to rebut the message from the GOP. He talks with John Berman about his role at the convention in the midst of Tropical Storm Isaac. Villaraigosa says he’s in Tampa to challenge the Republican platform “in a way that is respectful of the other party.”  “We’re to compare and contrast, but we’re also here together, working together, to make sure that people are safe," he says.
