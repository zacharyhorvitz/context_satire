Green Day played a secret-show in Costa Mesa, California on August 11, 2011, where they performed various songs from the upcoming album, including "Let Yourself Go". Later on, the song was also played at few other secret shows of the band. A recording of the band performing the song live at Red 7 in Austin, Texas on November 17, 2011 was released online on July 30, 2012 as the "official live video" for the song. On December 1, 1970 the single "Let Yourself Go" / "Your Time Hasn't Come Yet, Baby" was re-released as part of RCA Victor's Gold Standard Series (together with 9 other Presley's singles). Brown and his musicians continued to experiment with the arrangement of "Let Yourself Go" during rehearsals on the road. Eventually a new song, "There Was a Time", developed from the accumulated changes. It was recorded live on stage at the Apollo Theater, where it was the longest part of an extended medley with "Let Yourself Go" and "I Feel All Right". Released in edited form as the B-side of "I Can't Stand Myself (When You Touch Me)", "There Was a Time" charted #3 R&B and #36 Pop.
