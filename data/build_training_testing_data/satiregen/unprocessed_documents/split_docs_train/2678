Charlie L. Russell was born in Monroe, Louisiana, the eldest of two children of Charlie, Sr. and Katie Russell. His father moved to Oakland, California, in 1942 and became a shipyard worker. The family was reunited with the father a year later. Charlie and his younger and more famous brother, basketball legend Bill Russell, attended local Oakland schools. Bill Russell was born in 1934 to Charles Russell and Katie Russell in Monroe, Louisiana. Like almost all Southern towns and cities of that time, Monroe was very segregated, and the Russells often struggled with racism in their daily lives. Russell's father was once refused service at a gas station until the staff had taken care of all the white customers first. When he attempted to leave and find a different station, the attendant stuck a shotgun in his face and threatened to kill him if he didn't stay and wait his turn. Charles Russell was described as a "stern, hard man" who initially worked in a paper factory as a janitor, which was  a typical "Negro Job"â€”low paid and not intellectually challenging, as sports journalist John Taylor commented. When World War II broke out, the elder Russell became a truck driver. Russell was closer to his mother Katie than to his father, and he received a major emotional blow when she suddenly died when he was 12 years old. His father gave up his trucking job and became a steelworker to be closer to his semi-orphaned children.
