In 2003, Farber was considered for a seat on the New Jersey Supreme Court by former Gov. James McGreevey. A nomination did not materialize after it was revealed that she had an unpaid traffic ticket for unsafe driving, which led to a bench warrant being issued. Farber claimed she received no notice of a hearing and paid a fine to resolve the matter. Cardinale, one of two Republicans to oppose Farber's nomination, said that he was concerned about the state appointing someone who had been repeatedly accused of breaking traffic laws as its top law enforcement official. "Your record taken in its totality does not support the notion that you have respect for the law," he said. Later, he said that approving Farber's nomination might send a message "to young people, to the whole population of the state of New Jersey, that it's O.K. to offend the law repeatedly time after time. During Farber's nomination proceedings, Senator Gerald Cardinale, a Republican from Bergen County, directed some of the most pointed queries at Farber. "Can you tell me how many times you've gotten speeding tickets or is it an isolated incident?" Cardinale asked. Farber apologized for her driving history but offered no specifics.
