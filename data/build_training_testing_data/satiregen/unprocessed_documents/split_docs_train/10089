 Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's running mate, will share the stage in Danville, Kentucky, in their only debate. Biden and Ryan's debate follows the top of the tickets' first of three debates last week, in which Obama turned in a lackluster performance, upstaged by an aggressive and vibrant Romney. Here are five things to watch for on Thursday night: 1. Will Biden go where Obama didn't?  Vice President Joe Biden is a gaffe-prone avuncular type; Rep. Paul Ryan's is a wonky Gen-Xer. But both men will face the same challenge at their debate on Thursday: staying out of their own way. "Biden, the thing he does so well for someone his age is he has a lot of energy," said Melissa Wade, a debate professor at Emory University. "A lot of the way he messes up is he's so energetic, he gets wound up and he finds an inappropriate metaphor and runs with it."  Paul Ryan has a constant companion on the campaign trail -- a weighty burden he clearly can't live without. It's an oversized, well-worn brown briefcase that holds about 40 pounds of paperwork that he's been studying nonstop to prepare for his debate with Vice President Joe Biden. Ryan sat down for an exclusive interview with CNN to give some insight into how he is getting ready for his 90-minute face-off. As he held the bulging briefcase in his lap, he told us that this is the way he has gotten ready for moments large and small his whole life: intense study.
