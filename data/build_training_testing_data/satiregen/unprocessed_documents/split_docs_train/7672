 Call it what it is: a desperate midterm election Hail Mary -- President Donald Trump floating a proposal to eliminate birthright citizenship by executive order. Let's cut to the chase: This literally can't happen. In the President's way is a little thing called the Constitution, which he swore under oath to uphold. Birthright citizenship is a hot-button issue for anti-immigration activists, adding to Trump's intentionally toxic rhetoric about a migrant "invasion." Also, the president-elect's name is typically added after the "I", for example, "I, George Washington, do...." Normally, the chief justice of the United States administers the oath. It is sometimes asserted that the oath bestows upon the president the power to do whatever is necessary to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution." Andrew Jackson, while vetoing an Act for the renewal of the charter of the national bank, implied that the president could refuse to execute statutes that he felt were unconstitutional. In suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, President Abraham Lincoln claimed that he acted according to the oath. Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental.
