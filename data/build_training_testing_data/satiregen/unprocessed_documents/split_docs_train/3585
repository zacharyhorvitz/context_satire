A made-for-television documentary about the film, I'm Healthy, I'm Alive, and I'm Free (alternative title: The Making of Midnight Express), was released on January 1, 1977. It is seven minutes long. It features commentary from the cast and crew on how they worked together during production, and the effort it took from beginning to completion. It also includes footage from the creation of the film, and Billy Hayes' emotional first visit to the prison set. Cooper (Chris Marquette) is a slacker and he works as a telemarketer. On a Friday, he turns up late for work and is promptly fired by his boss, Maureen (Deborah Geffner). He is fired for coming late, driving customers away, and fooling around in the office. Shortly after, an extremely loud sound is heard and Cooper faints with pained expressions on his face. Staub gave a hint about the new name stating, "we have some Asian painters coming up with the artwork". Straub's team had not held a job fair or hired staff to run the operation, apart from the few facilities and security staff that were inherited with the purchase of the Revel in 2015. Straub said anyone who learned the resort was open, was welcome to check in. The property was renamed TEN Atlantic City in September 2016, with an opening predicted for early 2017, but this did not happen.
