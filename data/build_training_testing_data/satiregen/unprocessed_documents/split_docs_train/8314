The Pew Research Center released its 10th annual report on Global Restrictions on Religion as part of the Pew-Templeton Global Religious Futures project, funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the John Templeton Foundation. While the previous reports focused on year-over-year change, this report provides a broader look at the trend in particular regions and in 198 countries. The report documents how government restrictions on religion and social hostilities involving religion have changed and increased, from 2007 to 2017. It said 52 governments impose high levels of restrictions on religion, up from 40 in 2007, while 56 countries experienced the highest levels of social hostilities involving religion, up from 38 in 2007.  Millennials are less interested in following politics, but they have a harder time avoiding it on social media than older generations. Nearly a quarter of Millennials who use Facebook said that at least half of the posts they see on the site pertain to government and politics, according to a study released Monday by Pew Research Center. That is higher than the portion of Gen-Xers and Baby Boomers who found that politics and government had a huge presence on the site. The study's findings illustrate the rising importance of Facebook as a news source. In March 2014, the Pew Research Center issued a report about how "millennials in adulthood" are "detached from institutions and networked with friends." The report said millennials are somewhat more upbeat than older adults about America's future, with 49% of millennials saying the country's best years are ahead, though they're the first in the modern era to have higher levels of student loan debt and unemployment.
