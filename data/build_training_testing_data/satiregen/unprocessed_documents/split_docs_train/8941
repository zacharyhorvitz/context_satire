EMI is closely associated with the Beatles, who recorded almost all of their albums and hits there between 1962 and 1970 using the four-track REDD mixing console designed by Peter K. Burkowitz. The Beatles named their 1969 album Abbey Road, after the street where the studio is located, following which the studio was renamed to Abbey Road Studios. Iain Macmillan took the album's cover photograph outside the studios, with the result that the nearby zebra crossing has become a place of pilgrimage for Beatles fans. It has been a tradition for visitors to pay homage to the band by writing on the wall in front of the building even though it is painted over every three months. J-Rocks made their mark as the first Indonesian band to have recorded at the world-famous Abbey Road studios in the United Kingdom. The recording and mixing process were performed during the five days from 12â€“16 October 2008. At Abbey Road studios, they were helped by Chris Butler, a renowned sound engineer. The result was their EP album, Road to Abbey, which contained 5 songs, released in 2009. The Beatles at Abbey Road is a multimedia presentation hosted by Abbey Road Studios in London that focused on the recording career of the English rock band the Beatles. It took place from 18 July to 11 September 1983, while part of the studios were undergoing renovation. The program included a guided tour of Abbey Road's Studio 2, where the Beatles recorded most of their music for EMI in the 1960s; a two-part video presentation narrated by disc jockey Roger Scott, with interviews and rare archival footage; and previously unheard outtakes from the band's recording sessions. The event was hosted by studio manager Ken Townsend and the shows took place three times a day.
