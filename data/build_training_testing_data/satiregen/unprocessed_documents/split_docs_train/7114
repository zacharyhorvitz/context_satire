In his final debate before the Iowa Caucus, Biden participated in the December 13 forum sponsored by The Des Moines Register. His most notable part came when asked to respond to allegations that he was "uncomfortable" speaking about race since making remarks earlier in the year when he referred to Barack Obama using the adjectives "clean" and "articulate". Biden answered the question remarking that anyone who has known him knew of this commitment to civil rights and race relations. Barack Obama came to his defense, saying: "Joe is on the right side of the issues and is fighting every day for a better America."  If the day ends in a "y" it's a good bet that Joe Biden has stumbled into yet another campaign trail gaffe. The error-prone Democratic front-runner is now caught in a fresh self-inflicted storm over a poignant story he told about an Afghan war hero that seems a mishmash of three separate tales. This after he assured a rapt crowd in New Hampshire last Friday about a story later fact-checked by The Washington Post: "This is the God's truth. My word as a Biden."  Former Vice President Joe Biden is preparing for a lengthy Democratic primary battle despite his status as the front-runner in national polls, senior campaign aides said Tuesday. Biden could withstand a loss in Iowa because of his strength among minority voters in the more diverse states that follow it in the presidential nominating process, the aides said. "We expect this to be a fight. We expect this to go for a while," a senior campaign aide said during a call briefing reporters on Biden's approach to the campaign this fall.
