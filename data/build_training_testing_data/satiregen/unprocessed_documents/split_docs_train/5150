 Kurdish forces guarding a US military base in northern Syria told CNN they feel they've been betrayed by their American allies after US President Donald Trump cleared the way for a Turkish operation against them. "The Americans sold us out and we do not expect them to help us fight the Turkish troops," one Kurdish fighter told CNN, as a US flag fluttered over the base. US personnel at the base in northern Syria said they could not speak to CNN due to the sensitive nature of their work here. But, based on comments from the Kurds protecting the base, their relationship has become strained.  Chiefs of tribal nations that once inhabited Georgia say that the Atlanta Braves' tomahawk chop is insensitive and inappropriate. The comments from Cherokee and Creek chiefs come after the Atlanta Braves said the team would hold a "continued dialogue" with Native Americans during the Major League Baseball offseason about whether to keep the decades-old tradition. The Braves did not specify which tribal nations it planned to talk to. "Although the Tomahawk Chop may be a game day tradition, it is not an appropriate acknowledgment of tribal tradition or culture," Muscogee (Creek) Nation Principal Chief James R. Floyd said in a statement to CNN.  As the country trains its gaze on the 2020 presidential election, for LGBTQ Americans, there are similarly important political contests to keep an eye on: next year's Senate elections. That's because, in May, the Democrat-led House of Representatives passed the Equality Act, an expansive bill that would protect against anti-LGBTQ discrimination in all aspects of commercial and public life. If the Democrats retain the House and win the Senate in 2020, many expect that they would have the votes to send the measure to the President's desk. CNN is set to host an LGBTQ town hall with 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, where the Equality Act is sure to be discussed, airing on Thursday from 7:30 p.m. to 12 a.m.
