In June 2009, Marr told an interviewer on London's XFM, "I think we were offered 50 million dollars for three ... possibly five shows." He said that the chances of a reunion were "nothing to do with money", and that the reasons were "really abstract". In October 2019, in a new interview with The Zach Sang Show, Smith expressed excitement about their upcoming record, which will land sometime in 2020. The singer also confirmed that their newest offering will feature fewer ballads and plenty of poppier tracks in the vein of their recent two previous singles. Smith said, "I feel like I have recently shown a side of me which I normally keep to myself or for my family and friends,” Smith told Sang. “I showed everyone it and everyone loved it. Smith was raised in a Baptist household and attended a Catholic school. In a 2013 interview, he did not identify as religious; however, in 2015 Smith said in an interview with The Christian Post that his Christian faith, which was instilled in him by his grandmother, helped him to accurately portray his role as Bennet Omalu in Concussion saying, "She was my spiritual teacher, she was that grandmother at the church, the one having the kids doing the Easter presentations and putting on the Christmas plays and her kids and grandkids had to be first. She was the most spiritually certain person that I had ever met in my entire life. Even to the point that when she was dying she was happy, like she was really excited about going to heaven."
