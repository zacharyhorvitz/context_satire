In the early 1990s, Old Ebbitt Grill was financially one of the best-performing restaurants in the city. In July 1992, the Washington Business Journal said the 390-seat Old Ebbitt Grill grossed more money than any other restaurant in the D.C. metropolitan area. It spent $17,000 a month on table linens. The Washington Post's Phyllis Richman claimed the combination of superb hamburgers with seasonal foods such as fresh Alaskan halibut, corn on the cob in the summer, and locally grown vegetables and berries, was what drew customers. Old Ebbitt Grill reopened at 675 15th Street NW in early October 1983. Clyde's Restaurant Group spent $4.4 million constructing and outfitting the interior. The architectural firm of Andrews & Chatelain designed the interior. The interior decoration was designed to mimic the bar at 1427 F Street, and included the game trophies, some of which were originals, not recreations, and rumored to have been shot by President Theodore Roosevelt. The restaurant also instituted a "back waiter" system. Back waiters were trained to balance plates of food on their arms, so they could get them to tables faster without the need to load and unload trays. Back waiters were required to have excellent physical strength and good balance. The back waiter system was created so that waiters continued to wait on tables rather than spending time in the kitchen waiting for orders to be filled.
