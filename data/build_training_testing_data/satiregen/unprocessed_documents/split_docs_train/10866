There is reasonable evidence that Maybelline products were tested on animals. In 1989, L’Oréal ceased to use animal testing in finished products prior to launch and committed to developing alternative methods. According to a 2010 report, though, it is required by law in some countries to use animal testing. In 2016, Gupta collaborated with Maybelline New York to produce a collection of clothes  inspired by a new lipstick line that the company was launching. She later admitted that the project fell through for a variety of logistical reasons. She has stated that the biggest regret of her career was her Stylista collection. In January 2019, it was announced that De Jager would serve as the Global Beauty Adviser for Marc Jacobs Beauty. The brand stated in a press release "In this newly created role, Nikkie will be integrated into the brand’s product development process, as well as share her incredible talent and expertise to expand unique content and artistry around the world on both Marc Jacobs beauty and his own channels."
