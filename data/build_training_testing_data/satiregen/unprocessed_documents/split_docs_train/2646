Although environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of government protection acts, most people view these agencies as being of prime importance in establishing and maintaining basic standards that protect both the environment and the people interacting with it.  The Trump administration is taking steps toward an anticipated move to roll back greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy rules for cars, The New York Times reported Thursday. The newspaper reported that details of the initiative remain in flux, but noted that the plan "could substantially roll back the Obama-era standards," citing two sources familiar with deliberations over the move. An Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman confirmed to the Times that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has given the White House a 16-page draft proposal to review. A weakening of automobile standards would deliver a win for car manufacturers and a blow to environmentalists. The Environmental Protection Agency can only act under statutes, which are the authority of laws passed by Congress. Congress must approve the statute and they also have the power to authorize or prohibit certain actions, which the EPA has to implement and enforce. Appropriations statutes authorize how much money the agency can spend each year to carry out the approved statutes. The Environmental Protection Agency has the power to issue regulations.
