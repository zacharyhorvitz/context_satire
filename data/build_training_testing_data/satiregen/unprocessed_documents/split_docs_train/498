 The East Coast is on edge. Hurricane Joaquin is the reason why. On Thursday, it lashed the Bahamas as a Category 4 storm with 130 mph winds. It's what is expected to come next that has the United States worried: a stronger storm and a sharp turn north.  Joaquin strengthened into a major hurricane on Wednesday night, the U.S. National Hurricane Center announced. The Category 3 storm is poised to pound the Bahamas with heavy rain and dangerous storm surges. And the storm's movement later this week could have flooding implications for an already drenched eastern United States. While forecasters are having a hard time figuring where Joaquin is headed, they believe the storm will continue to strengthen over the next day or so.  Along the Northeast, officials are trying to assure the public that Hurricane Joaquin won't be another Superstorm Sandy. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Thursday declared a state of emergency in anticipation of Hurricane Joaquin, a Category 4 storm that could get stronger. Joaquin's forecast track shows it could be near North Carolina by Monday and possibly New Jersey a day later -- a path that could bring it hauntingly close to where Superstorm Sandy made landfall in 2012.
