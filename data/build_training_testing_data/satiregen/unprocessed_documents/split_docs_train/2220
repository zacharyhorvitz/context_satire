Crisscrossing America for casting calls in many cities and pouring over auditioning tapes, the producers divided the country into "Hot Zones" that included every state. From the thousands who tried only thirty-two people from each zone made the cut. They'll be judged by the three celebrity panel and at the end of each episode, viewers were invited to vote for their favorite male and female participants. The following week, viewers would find out whom America has chosen and repeat the whole process of 32 candidates from "Hot Zone 2" and so on until one breathtaking man and one stunning woman are crowned as "The Sexiest People in America". The French are a British rock band, formed by Darren Hayman and John Morrison after the band Hefner declared an indefinite hiatus. Musically there is a specific continuity between Hefner and The French, which is manifested not only in the lyrics and compositions but also in the use of vintage drum machines and synthesizers, an aesthetic choice that was very present in Hefner's last recordings.The French released one album, Local Information, on Too Pure in 2003. Their most recent work together was a John Peel session in August 2004. Since then Darren Hayman has been involved in a legal dispute with Too Pure, and has subsequently launched a solo career.  Even Stan Wawrinka had to smile before Sunday's French Open final when the stadium announcer listed year-by-year each of the nine previous titles Rafael Nadal had won at Roland Garros. Another one can now be added to the list -- and it is one for the ages -- after the Spaniard crushed Wawrinka 6-2 6-3 6-1 to become the first man to win the same grand slam on 10 occasions. The 'Decima.' Indeed it is a feat that may never be duplicated.
