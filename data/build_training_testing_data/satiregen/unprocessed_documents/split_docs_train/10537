The National School Boards Association (NSBA) is a nonprofit educational organization operating as a federation of state associations of school boards across the United States. Founded in 1940, NSBA represents state school boards associations and their more than 90,000 local school board members. It argues that education is a civil right, and public education is America's most vital institution. In March of 2019, the Delegate Assembly of the National School Boards Association considered a non-partisan climate action resolution proposed by the Pacific Region Governors, including San Luis Coastal School District Trustee Chris Ungar. The New York State School Boards Association (NYSSBA) serves as the statewide voice of more than 700 boards of education. The collective influence of some 5,000 school board members, who constitute half the elected officials in the state, enables NYSSBA to work toward the benefit of the elementary and secondary public school system in New York. School board members are the educational leaders of their communities; they determine policies that govern the operation of their local public school system. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that in the U.S., 20.8% of students ages 12â€“18 experienced bullying at school in 2014-15. Prevention for bullying by parents, teachers, and other adults includes talking to students about bullying, modeling good examples of treating others with kindness, and helping students get involved in something they're passionate about. Helping students understand the importance of reporting bullying and teaching them ways to stop others from bullying can also be effective.
