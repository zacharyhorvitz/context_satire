 Bigger and better than before -- that's the promise as the NFL International Series returns to London this weekend, and hopes are rising that Britain will one day have its own permanent franchise. Wembley Stadium will host American football's overseas showpiece for the eighth year running and, for the first time, the home of English soccer will welcome three regular-season games, spread over the next six weeks. Building on the two games it held last year and the one it hosted initially, overseas fans will get a rare glimpse of the United States' most popular sport. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed as early as February that the games had already sold out, meaning 270,000 spectators will witness the Oakland Raiders take on the Miami Dolphins, the Detroit Lions face the Atlanta Falcons and the Jacksonville Jaguars play the Dallas Cowboys.  American journalist Michael Scott Moore, held for more than two years by Somali pirates, has been freed, Moore's family and a Somali official told CNN on Tuesday. "We are just elated," Marlis Saunders, Moore's mother, said in a brief conversation. "It took a lot of work for us to get this point. And to hear he is free -- just joyful, I can't describe it."  An American sentenced in North Korea ripped up his visa so he could go to prison and expose human rights violations there, state media said Saturday. Matthew Todd Miller was convicted of committing "acts hostile" to North Korea and sentenced to six years of hard labor last week. Saturday's report in the state-run Korean Central News Agency boldly heaped blame on Miller, claiming his acts were a preconceived plan to gain notoriety. The 24-year-old from Bakersfield, California, arrived in North Korea as a tourist in April.
