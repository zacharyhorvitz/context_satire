In the season 14 finale, JJ reveals during a hostage situation in which the unsub forces her to expose her darkest secret that she has always loved Spencer and admitted that she was too afraid to say anything and that things had now become too complicated. Later on during Rossi’s wedding, Spencer asks JJ if she meant it to which she replies with silence and a glance to which Spencer replies with “everything’s ok”. Reid is close to JJ, Morgan, and Emily Prentiss. JJ asks him to be godfather to her newborn son Henry, and is one of the only two people on the team who calls him "Spence." It is implied in "Plain Sight" that Reid may have a slight crush on JJ, and Gideon even prods him to ask out JJ after giving him Washington Redskins football tickets for his birthday, but nothing comes from it, and they continue with their brother-sister relationship. However, Reid is very protective of her, and often blames himself if she is injured; even if there was nothing he could have done to prevent it. In the months following, Reid throws himself into his work when he is not able to sleep because of a recurring dream where Maeve asks him to dance with her, but forces himself to wake up before he answers. By the end of "Alchemy", Reid is able to complete the dream by accepting Maeve's request to dance with her. In "The Inspiration", Reid admits that, had Maeve not died, he might have had kids. In the season nine finale, it is revealed that he still carries a copy of The Narrative of John Smith in his bag.
