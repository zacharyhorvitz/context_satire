Angela (53, from Hazlehurst, Georgia) and Michael (31, from Lagos, Nigeria) are returning from Seasons 1 and 2 of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. After initially breaking up at the end of Season 1, they reunited Season 2. The reunion has since been a rollercoaster filled with lies, numerous arguments, financial theft, and probable infertility on Angela's part due to her age. Nonetheless, the couple celebrated an engagement party thrown by his family in Nigeria, and are seeking a K1 for Michael so they can get married in the United States in front of her mother. Her parents, Owen and Priscilla, married early in their relationship and lived in a back-to-nature hippie commune in Caldecott County, Mississippi. Born as Anna Marie, she also enjoyed the attentions of her Aunt Carrie, on her mother's side. Anna Marie was raised speaking colloquial English and French, common to the Mississippi bayou area. The commune's failed attempt to use Native American mysticism to reach the "Far Banks" resulted in Priscilla's disappearance. Anna (38 from Bellevue, Nebraska) met Mursel (38, from Antalya, Turkey) on social media. Despite their language barrier, their romance blossomed. Four months after her trip to Turkey, he proposed. Although Anna is looking forward to getting a happily ever after with Mursel, his family doesn’t know about her three children, and would never approve of her choice to have children out of wedlock.
