According to parliamentary rules, the Speaker is the highest authority of the House of Commons and has final say over how its business is conducted, as well as other key choices, for example, which tabled amendments are selected for votes. In addition to the role of presiding officer, the Speaker performs several other functions on the behalf of the House of Commons. The Speaker represents the body in relations with the Sovereign, the House of Lords, and non-parliamentary bodies. On important occasions of state (such as Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee in 2002), the Speaker presents Addresses to the Crown on behalf of the House. The House of Commons was established in 1867, when the British North America Act (now called the Constitution Act, 1867) created the Dominion of Canada and was modelled on the British House of Commons. The lower of the two houses making up the parliament, the House of Commons in practice holds far more power than the upper house, the Senate. Although the approval of both Houses is necessary for legislation to become law, the Senate very rarely rejects bills passed by the Commons (though the Senate does occasionally amend bills). Moreover, the Cabinet is responsible solely to the House of Commons. In May and June 1939, Elizabeth and her husband toured Canada from coast to coast and back, and visited the United States, spending time with President Roosevelt at the White House and his Hudson Valley estate. U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt said that Elizabeth was "perfect as a Queen, gracious, informed, saying the right thing & kind but a little self-consciously regal". The tour was designed to bolster trans-Atlantic support in the event of war, and to affirm Canada's status as an independent kingdom sharing with Britain the same person as monarch.
