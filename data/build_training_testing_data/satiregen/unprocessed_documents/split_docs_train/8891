 What do Democrats really want from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation? It's a simple enough question, but the answers can be complicated and conflicting. The most obvious, and prevalent, would be the "smoking gun" -- proof positive that President Donald Trump personally negotiated or signed off on the terms of Moscow's meddling in the 2016 election. The reality, of course, is that Mueller is unlikely to turn up anything quite so bold.  It took barely an hour for President Donald Trump's first, and best, defense to crumble after special counsel Robert Mueller's charging spree. And in a cascade of developments, it quickly became clear that the Russia cloud engulfing the White House is only thickening -- and may not be disbursed until deep into the President's term, if ever. "Taken together, it seems to me that this is a very important interim development in the Mueller investigation, but only as an appetizer," said Steve Vladeck, CNN legal contributor and professor at the University of Texas Law School. "And like most meals, if all we get is an appetizer, I think folks on all sides of the political spectrum will find the denouement rather unsatisfying.  The dramatic intensification of the Russia investigation on Monday reignited President Donald Trump's fury at the controversy clouding his presidency, prompting his aides to urgently advise him against lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller as they work to revive a halting policy agenda. Watching the developments unfold on the large television screens installed in his private residence, Trump was "seething," according to a Republican close to the White House. The indictments on Monday of campaign aides Paul Manafort and Rick Gates weren't a surprise to Trump, according to people who have spoken with the President. Trump has long assumed that members of his presidential campaign would be swept up in Mueller's probe.
