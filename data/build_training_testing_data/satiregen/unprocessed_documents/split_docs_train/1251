Following her husband's murder, Taya has given speeches and talks addressing his service and veterans' issues at numerous venues, as well as appeared on news networks such as CNN and Fox News. She is an advocate for women and families who have lost family members while serving in war. In August 2013, the state of Texas enacted the Chris Kyle Law (SB162), which was created to "expand the effort to help ease employment challenges for active duty military members and their spouses". At the ceremony, Kyle stated, "I hope that by incorporating these changes into current Texas law we can honor the legacy of Chris Kyle and the many like him." Sean Burns wrote in the Philadelphia Weekly that Levine "knows how to stay out of the way long enough to let a very talented cast shine, and Rogen's fundamental, unexpected decency, which can often only be expressed through shoulder-punching obscenities, grows more quietly moving as the picture wears on." The film follows Gunther Wheeler (Kyle Howard), who moves from the large city of New York to the quiet suburb of Pleasant Valley, New York. When he needs money to buy tickets to a concert for a date with a girl (Kylee Cochran) he likes, he gets a job as a local paperboy. When several bullies try to take over his neighborhood, Gunther and his new friends must stand-up against them, and stop them with the help of Crazy Man Cooper (Robert Englund).
