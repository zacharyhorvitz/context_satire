In June 2013, Tesla announced the goal to deploy a battery swapping station in each of its existing supercharging stations, to be renamed Tesla stations. At an event at Tesla's design studio in Los Angeles, CEO Elon Musk demonstrated a battery swap operation with the Tesla Model S, which took just over 90 seconds each for the two cars participating in the demo. The swapping operation took less than half the time needed to refill a gasoline-powered car used for comparison purposes during the event.  Tesla may have overcome some of its Model 3 production problems, but Elon Musk & Co. now face another unwanted issue. Every Model 3 is about to become more expensive. That's because Tesla customers who receive their cars after the end of the year won't be getting a $7,500 tax credit. The federal tax credit serves as an incentive for US car shoppers who choose eco-friendly plug-in vehicles. In an interview for Wired Science recorded during 2006 Musk presented the Model 3 as likely being affordable by most people able to purchase new cars. In 2008 the car was stated to be a family car. In 2017 Tesla added that the Standard Range version of the all-electric car would have an estimated EPA-rated range of 220 miles (354 km), a five-passenger seating capacity, front and rear trunks, and promised sports-car levels of acceleration performance. Tesla said it would have a 5-Star safety rating and have a drag coefficient of Cd=0.23.
