In 1995, Cowan co-founded Initial Entertainment Group (IEG) with Graham King. During her tenure as president, IEG had successes that included: an Emmy nomination for Rent-A-Kid starring Leslie Nielsen; Emmy, Golden Globe and People's Choice nominations for If These Walls Could Talk; a United Nations Award for Savior starring Dennis Quaid; and Oscar-winning Traffic starring Michael Douglas. Additional projects produced by Cowan included Very Bad Things and Robert Altman's Dr. T & the Women. Robert Stewart and his two sons favoured the Act of Union and fought to have it presented once more after it had been turned down in 1799. As a result of the vote, Robert Stewart obtained a seat in the House of Lords in London, which he never took up. In 1816 he was created Marquess of Londonderry, due to the influence of his son, Lord Castlereagh. This title is again in the Peerage of Ireland. Robert's mother had a half-brother Robert Cowan, a son of her father's first wife, while she was from the second marriage. This half-brother had made a fortune while being Governor of Bombay and had died in London on 21 February 1737, soon after having returned from Bombay. Robert's parents married about 3 months after his death. In his will the Governor bequeathed his estate to his younger brother and then to his half-sister.
