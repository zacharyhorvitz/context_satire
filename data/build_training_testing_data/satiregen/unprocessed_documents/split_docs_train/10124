 As they struggle to save for retirement, a growing number of middle-class Americans plan to postpone their golden years until they are in their 80's. Nearly one-third, or 30%, now plan to work until they are 80 or older -- up from 25% a year ago, according to a Wells Fargo survey of 1,000 adults with income less than $100,000. "It is so tough for Americans to save for retirement that the answer seems to be to work longer," said Joe Ready, director of Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust. Overall, 70% of respondents plan to work during retirement, many of whom plan to do so because they simply won't be able to afford to retire full time.  The candidates were in their Sunday best attire and behavior last night at the Alfred E. Smith Charity Dinner. Both President Obama and Mitt Romney took playful jabs at each other and at themselves for a good cause. But it was probably just for one night. Just a few days ago, there was little to joke about when the candidates went face to face over integral issues at the second presidential debate.  First-time claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, but the broader trend remains choppy, making it difficult to get a clear reading on the job market in October. About 369,000 people filed for first-time unemployment benefits in the week ended October 20, down 23,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday. The initial claims number has bounced around for the last five weeks, pointing to little improvement in the job market since September. The four-week moving average, which smooths out some of the volatility, has risen for the last two weeks but overall, the story there has largely remained the same since July.
