But one of the strengths that makes America exceptional is our willingness to openly confront our past, face our imperfections, make changes and do better." Hastening the CIA's fall from grace was the burglary of the Watergate headquarters of the Democratic Party by former CIA officers, and President Richard Nixon's subsequent attempt to use the CIA to impede the FBI's investigation of the burglary.

Haldeman, to tell the CIA that further investigation of Watergate would "open the whole can of worms about the Bay of Pigs". In this way Nixon and Haldemann ensured that the CIA's No. 1 and No. It also concluded that "the claims that Bland√≥n and Meneses were responsible for introducing crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles and spreading the crack epidemic throughout the country were unsupported."
