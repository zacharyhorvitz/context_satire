The Windham County Sheriff's Department fell into controversy most recently when its then Sheriff, Sheila Prue was alleged to be stealing department funds, using department equipment for personal use and for mismanagement of the department. Controversies arose regarding many deputies receiving insufficient training as well. Late 2006, Prue resigned and the reigns of the department were left to Richard Guthrie, a long-time veteran law enforcement officer in the Windham County community. John Moore was sworn in as the first sheriff of what was then called Harrisburg County (later renamed Harris County) in February 1837. Among the oldest law enforcement agencies in Texas, the department has grown from a single man on horseback to a modern agency with 3500 employees, including over 2500 sworn officers. The County Sheriff's Office is under the direction and control of the County Sheriff, who is elected County-wide to serve a four-year term. To assist the Sheriff in the performance of his duties, the Sheriff appoints an Undersheriff to oversee the day-to-day operations of the entire Office and to perform the duties of the Sheriff in his absence. Additionally, the Sheriff employees a Chief Deputy Sheriff, who oversees all law enforcement activities of the Office, and a Jail Superintendent, who is responsible for the management of the County jail and detention center.
