 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reluctantly offered Congress a few details about his September meeting with President Donald Trump, telling lawmakers on Wednesday that antitrust did not come up during their conversation in the Oval Office. Asked during a House Financial Services Committee hearing whether antitrust investigations into Facebook came up in the West Wing, Zuckerberg said: "I don't think so, but the meeting was private, overall." "Those subjects didn't come up, but in general I don't feel like it's appropriate for me to comment in too much detail on private conversations," he said. Zuckerberg also said that the topic of Facebook's policies on fact-checking politicians did not come up during his conversation with Trump.  Everyone has a breaking point. It's worth remembering that fact at this moment as congressional Republicans find themselves confronted with a cavalcade of troubling news stories about President Donald Trump and his conduct in office. Because while elected GOP officials have almost totally capitulated to Trump's hostile takeover of their party, there is always a point at which you simply cannot look even quasi-objectively at the actions of this president and conclude that standing behind him remains the right (or even defensible) thing to do. And this week sure looks like just that sort of breaking point moment.  Just when you were wondering whatever happened to Jared Kushner, the White House adviser who got his job because his father-in-law is President, he popped up on an Israeli TV station on Monday to jab at the Democrat who may be on the ballot opposing President Donald Trump in 2020. He said he's been busy cleaning up "the messes" that former Vice President Joe Biden was supposedly responsible for creating related to the Middle East and criminal justice. Kushner's simplistic take sheds little light on the two issues he named, but illumination was not the point. No soundbite could ever help anyone understand the problems he pointed to.
