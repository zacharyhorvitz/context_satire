 Meghan Markle will make a striking feminist statement in her wedding to Prince Harry on Saturday, choosing not to be chaperoned for much of the procession down the aisle of St. George's Chapel, Windsor, CNN has learned. In an unprecedented step for a royal bride in the UK, Markle will walk unescorted down the aisle of the chapel nave, after being met at the West Door by a member of the clergy. She will be accompanied in this first part of the wedding procession only by her bridesmaids and page boys, with the senior church figure walking ahead. Prince Charles will join her when she reaches the Quire, where the main royal guests will be seated.  The American actress Meghan Markle has confirmed that her father, Thomas Markle, will not attend her wedding to Britain's Prince Harry on Saturday. Her statement ends days of speculation over the 73-year-old's health, and a controversy over whether he staged a series of paparazzi-style photographs. "Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health," Meghan Markle said in a statement provided by Kensington Palace Thursday.  Meghan Markle's mother, Doria Ragland, was meeting Queen Elizabeth for tea at Windsor Castle Friday, as final preparations were made for the royal wedding on Saturday. Ragland met several other members of the British royal family Thursday, Kensington Palace said, ahead of her daughter's marriage to Prince Harry, the Queen's grandchild and sixth in line to the throne. She had tea with the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall -- Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla -- at Clarence House in London. Later, she met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their two older children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, during wedding rehearsals in Windsor.
