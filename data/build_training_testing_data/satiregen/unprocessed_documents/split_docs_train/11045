Weber has a brother, Brandon, who is two years younger than him. Brandon grew up playing hockey with Shea's former Predators teammate Cody Franson. When Weber was 14, his mother was diagnosed with brain cancer, which surgery mostly removed. However, she later began suffering from similar symptoms, and in early 2010, had a series of seizures. When Ross went to court to face the charges, "Greg volunteered to be my attorney as a favor. I remember we slept in his parents' basement in Queens. We drove to court in a Jeep and had dirty blue sport jackets on. It took him two tries, but he got the case dismissed." Giraldo said on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on July 7, 2005, that he had quit drinking alcohol. His series Friday Night Stand-Up with Greg Giraldo began on Comedy Central in late 2005 and ran until 2006. His CD Good Day to Cross a River was released in 2006 by Comedy Central Records. Giraldo was featured (along with Dane Cook and Sean Rouse) in Dave Attell's Insomniac Tour, released April 2006.
