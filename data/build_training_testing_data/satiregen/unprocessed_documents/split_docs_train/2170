Obama promised that he would run the "most transparent" administration in US history, with mixed results. On taking office, the Obama administration said that all executive orders, non-emergency legislation, and proclamations would be posted to the official White House website, whitehouse.gov, allowing the public to review and comment for five days before the President signs the legislation, but this pledge was twice broken during Obama's first month in office. On January 21, 2009, by executive order, Obama revoked Executive Order 13233, which had limited access to the records of former United States presidents. Obama issued instructions to all agencies and departments in his administration to "adopt a presumption in favor" of Freedom of Information Act requests.  The moment that Donald Trump took the oath of office and became the 45th President, a transformation occurred -- online. Simultaneous with the formal transfer of power that occurred on the steps of our nation's Capitol, the entire White House digital presence was changed over. The White House website changed from the administration of former President Barack Obama to that of Trump. As a result, it appeared to Internet users that the Obama administration had vanished -- tweets and all.  President Barack Obama plans to travel to Palm Springs after the inauguration Friday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday. "The first family is looking forward to flying to Palm Springs, California, on Friday," Earnest said, noting the desert city fits the bill of a warm destination, which Obama has long promised. "He and his family have enjoyed the time they spent there in the past, and they're looking forward to traveling there on Friday," Earnest added. Obama will fly aboard the presidential aircraft to the Coachella Valley oasis, where he's taken frequent golf trips as president, two sources familiar with his plans told CNN earlier Tuesday.
