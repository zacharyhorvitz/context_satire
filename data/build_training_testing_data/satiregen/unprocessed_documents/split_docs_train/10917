 (CNN) -- An Army veteran who neighbors say played in a far right punk band was the lone shooter in the rampage at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that killed six people and wounded four, according to information from law enforcement authorities. Wade Michael Page, 40, was shot to death by police responding to the Sunday morning attack in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek, the community's chief of police told reporters Monday. It was the latest violence against the Sikh community in the United States in apparent misdirected revenge for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. One of the heroes on Sunday was the president of the temple Satwant Kaleka, who passed away after trying to tackle the gunman and getting shot.  By the CNN Wire Staff (CNN) -- People of all faiths lit candles and prayed Tuesday night in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, for those killed and wounded at Sunday's mass shooting at a Sikh temple. The prayer and remembrance vigil, which appeared to draw a large crowd, was held outdoors in the Milwaukee suburb. The step toward healing came as family and friends recalled the six killed by a gunman. The older son of one victim, Paramjit Kaur, 41, said his mother was shot just after completing prayers.  Almost a week after the shooting rampage that killed six people and wounded three others on Sunday, the SikhTemple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin reopened today. CNN took an exclusive tour of the temple and spoke to its members. “Our temple will never be the same again,” said Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka, whose uncle died in the shootings. Tangible evidence of the massacre remains, in the form of a bullet hole shot through the door to the main prayer area.
