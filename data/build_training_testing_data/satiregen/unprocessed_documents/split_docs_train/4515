The Greeks or Hellenes (; Greek: Έλληνες, Éllines ) are an ethnic group native to Greece, Cyprus, Albania, Italy, Turkey, Egypt and, to a lesser extent, other countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. They also form a significant diaspora, with Greek communities established around the world.Greek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, but the Greek people have always been centered on the Aegean and Ionian seas, where the Greek language has been spoken since the Bronze Age. Until the early 20th century, Greeks were distributed between the Greek peninsula, the western coast of Asia Minor, the Black Sea coast, Cappadocia in central Anatolia, Egypt, the Balkans, Cyprus, and Constantinople. Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek colonization. Grecian Formula is a men's hair coloring product from Combe Incorporated. Until recently, the formulation used in the United States contained lead(II) acetate. Because lead acetate was banned in cosmetics in Canada and the European Union, the formulations sold there did not contain it. In 2017 Environmental Defense Fund and other consumer groups filed a complaint with the Food and Drug Administration to force the removal of lead acetate from Grecian Formula and other hair dyes.
