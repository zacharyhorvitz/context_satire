Jeffrey Fowle, an American arrested in North Korea in May for leaving a Bible at his hotel, has been released and is on his way home, a senior State Department official told CNN on Tuesday. An American government plane picked up Fowle on Tuesday before flying to Guam, the official said. Fowle was arrested at the airport earlier this year while trying to leave North Korea. CNN learned of Fowle's release earlier Tuesday but agreed not to report the news until he landed in Guam.
