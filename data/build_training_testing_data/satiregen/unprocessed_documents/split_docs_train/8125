The Stormy Danielsâ€“Donald Trump scandal is a political scandal involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels, Donald Trump, and Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen. The scandal surfaced in January 2018, when The Wall Street Journal revealed that shortly before the 2016 United States presidential election, Daniels had been paid $130,000 for signing a nondisclosure agreement about an affair she had with Trump in 2006. Later, Daniels signed a statement witnessed by her lawyer and her publicist denying that she had ever had an affair with Trump.  White House counselor Kellyanne Conway -- who managed Donald Trump's campaign in its final months -- said Friday she had no knowledge during the campaign about the $130,000 payment from Michael Cohen to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. "I had never heard about that during the campaign. I was the campaign manager," Conway told reporters at the White House. Asked if she knew about the payment last year in the White House, Conway replied, "I did not."  President Donald Trump is shifting his story about the Stormy Daniels controversy following the revelation by his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, that the President reimbursed a payment to the adult film actress by Michael Cohen. Trump -- who previously said he was not aware of the $130,000 Cohen paid to Daniels before the 2016 election in an effort to keep her quiet about an alleged affair between her and the President -- denied on Thursday that any campaign money was used to reimburse Cohen and said he was paid via retainer. The payment has prompted complaints to the Justice Department and Federal Election Commission over potential violations of campaign finance law. "Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA," Trump wrote on Twitter Thursday morning.
