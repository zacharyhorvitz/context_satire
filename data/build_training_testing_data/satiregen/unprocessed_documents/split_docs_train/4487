Under the U.S. Constitution, a two-thirds majority of the Senate is required to convict the president. The possible penalties for conviction are the removal from office and disqualification from holding office in the future, but the Senate would likely conduct separate votes for these. This means that Trump could be removed from office and still be able to continue running for re-election in the 2020 presidential race, or that he could remain in office, but be barred from re-election. Section 2 of Article Two lays out the powers of the presidency, establishing that the president serves as the commander-in-chief of the military, among many other roles. This section gives  the president the power to grant pardons, although there is some debate about the limitation set on this power. Some argue that this power cannot be used to stop an office holder from being impeached, while others go further and argue that the president cannot pardon criminal behavior for which an office holder has been impeached. A third view suggests that the constitution withholds the pardon power from the president while he is being impeached. The Constitution vests the president with Executive Power. That power reaches its zenith when wielded to protect national security. And federal courts in the United States must pay proper deference to the Executive in assessing the threats that face the nation. The president is the military's commander-in-chief; however Article One gives Congress and not the president the exclusive right to declare war.
