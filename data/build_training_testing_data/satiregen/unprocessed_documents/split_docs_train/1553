 A day after losing the first presidential debate, President Barack Obama and his campaign accused his Republican challenger Mitt Romney of being dishonest about tax policy and other issues. "If you want to be president, you owe the American people the truth," Obama said at a campaign rally Thursday in Denver. "So here's the truth: Governor Romney cannot pay for his $5 trillion tax plan without blowing up the deficit or sticking it to the middle class. That's the math."  Mitt Romney's solid debate performance Wednesday night gives him the type of energy and momentum that President Barack Obama now will have to work overtime to undo. "The thing that this debate did is it gave people reasons to think about (a) President Romney," said John Geer, chairman of Vanderbilt University's political science department. "This often happens with challengers in the first debate. Now Obama needs to reconnect with the American public and (make the case of) why he should be re-elected."  A bad week suddenly got a lot better for President Barack Obama, who was criticized by friends and foes for a lackluster debate performance before learning of record fundraising followed by Friday's stronger-than-expected jobs report. The drop in the unemployment rate to 7.8% provided both a tangible and symbolic campaign boost after analysts and a snap poll said he lost the first debate to Republican challenger Mitt Romney on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Democratic source familiar with fund-raising confirmed to CNN that the Obama re-election team raised more money in September than any campaign has brought in this election cycle. According to the source, the Obama campaign is expected to exceed $150 million for the month, topping the previous record of $114 million that the president's team raised in August.
