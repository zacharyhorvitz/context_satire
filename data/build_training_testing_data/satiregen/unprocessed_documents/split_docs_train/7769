Visitors still flocked to Vasquez's jail cell, many of them women. He signed autographs and posed for photographs. Vasquez sold the photos from the window of his cell and used the money to pay for his legal defense. After his conviction, he appealed for clemency. On January 28, Davis informed the Pelicans that he would not sign a contract extension in the coming off-season, and requested a trade. He is eligible to become a free agent in the summer of 2020. A day later, the NBA fined him $50,000 for making his request public. Davis recovered from his injury and was available to play, but the Pelicans said they would hold him out until after the league trade deadline on February 7. Vasquez remained in the Los Angeles County jail for nine days. He had numerous requests for interviews by many newspaper reporters, but agreed to see only three: two from the San Francisco Chronicle and one from the Los Angeles Star. He told them his aim was to return California to Mexican rule. He insisted he was an honorable man and claimed he had never killed anyone.
