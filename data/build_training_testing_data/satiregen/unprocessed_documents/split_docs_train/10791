 One crew member wrote her mother an email saying the crew was heading directly into Hurricane Joaquin. "Winds are super bad," she said. "Love to everyone." Another is about to become a new father and was supposed to return home soon to learn the gender of his expected twins.  Hillary Clinton grew emotional on the campaign trail Monday while introducing a mother whose child was killed during the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Clinton got choked up while bringing on to the stage Nicole Hockley, the mother of Dylan Hockley, a 6-year-old killed in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012. The families of those killed in Newtown "have taken the unimaginable grief that they have been bearing and have tried to be the voices" for gun violence victims, Clinton said, her voice breaking. "I want you to introduce yourself and maybe talk about what you and other parents are trying to do to get the changes that are necessary," Clinton said, turning to Hockley. Dylan's father, Abram Zimmerman—an electric-appliance shop owner—and mother, Beatrice "Beatty" Stone, were part of a small, close-knit Jewish community. They lived in Duluth until Dylan was six, when his father had polio and the family returned to his mother's hometown, Hibbing, where they lived for the rest of Dylan's childhood. In his early years he listened to the radio—first to blues and country stations from Shreveport, Louisiana, and later, when he was a teenager, to rock and roll.
