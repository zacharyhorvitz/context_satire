James Weber was the manager of the Hotel in the 1960s. He was a Yale graduate, who moved to Puerto Rico to work for the Vanderbilt Hotel company. His parents had once owned the Weber and Sons department stores in Chicago, and his Granddaughter, Melanie Laporte, was one of the four women on the Puerto Rican 4 by 100 freestyle team that won a bronze medal for Puerto Rico in the 1967 Pan American Games. Like Eric Beale, she is fond of Abby Sciuto; and, when the latter visited the OSP Operations Center, Hetty points out to the other agents Abby's ability to "be functional and stylish at the same time". When Deeks was shot and there was no one to call, Hetty told him to put her down as his next of kin for the future. In the same episode, Eric, like Abby, is shown to be skilled in sign language, beginning to learn it when he was seven years old. Near the episode's end, Eric signs to Abby that his best friend growing up was deaf. Like G. Callen, Sam Hanna, Kensi Blye and Nate Getz, he was introduced in the back-door pilot "Legend". In the opening episode of season seven, "Active Measures", Eric asks Sam to show him how to fire a weapon and how to fight, leaving open the possibility that he may want to try his hand as a field agent in the future.
