Partly based on such litigation experience, Congress enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, better known as the Clean Water Act. This act established a national framework for addressing water quality to be implemented by agency in partnership with the states.  President Obama's deal with China to have both countries make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions will cost the U.S. economy tens of billions of dollars a year, according to critics. And advocates of the agreement say that even if those cost estimates are correct, it would be money well spent. The case against the deal: "Our economy can't take the president's ideological War on Coal, which will increase the squeeze on middle-class families and struggling miners," said Senator Mitch McConnell, who is about to become Senate majority leader and comes from the coal belt state Kentucky. Studies prepared on behalf of industry groups and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce say Obama's efforts thus far to cut greenhouse gasses will cost the economy between $40 billion to $52 billion a year. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is the head of the United States federal government's Environmental Protection Agency, and is thus responsible for enforcing the nation's Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, as well as numerous other environmental statutes. The Administrator is nominated by the President of the United States and must be confirmed by a vote of the Senate. The office of Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency was created in 1970 in legislation that created the agency.
