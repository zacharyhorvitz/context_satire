 The Jennifer Lopez-backed NUVOtv cable channel will buy Fuse for $226 million, the companies said Friday. Fuse, a music television channel, is low-rated, but it has a foothold on cable and satellite lineups in 73 million households across the country. That's one of the reasons why it is valuable to NUVOtv, which is only available in about 32 million households. Fuse "enhances our distribution relationships" and "dramatically expands" its potential footprint, Michael Schwimmer, the chief executive of NUVOtv's parent company SiTV Media, said.
