On July 24, 2016, while still on the run, Caro Quintero gave an interview to Proceso magazine. In this interview he claims he did not kill Enrique Camarena. He told the reporter that after his release from prison, he was visited (separately) by "El Chapo" Guzman and Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada. He claims he told them he did not want to return to the business. Lamborghini's increasing wealth allowed him to purchase faster more expensive cars than the tiny Fiats he had tinkered with during his youth. He owned cars such as Alfa Romeos and Lancias during the early 1950s and at one point he had enough cars to use a different one every day of the week, adding a Mercedes-Benz 300SL, a Jaguar E-Type coup√©, and two Maserati 3500 GTs. Of the latter, Lamborghini said, "Adolfo Orsi, then the owner of Maserati, was a man I had a lot of respect for: he had started life as a poor boy, like myself. But I did not like his cars much. Silvana was also a track star - running and winning NYC Championship for the relay. She was coached by Sunny Pomales, a wonderful man who demanded the best from her. As life would have it, everything came together. In Silvana's first film, Windwalker, she had to do a scene where she had to run full out.
