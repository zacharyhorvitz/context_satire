Denny's (also known as Denny's Diner on some of the locations' signage) is an American table service diner-style restaurant chain. It operates over 1,600 restaurants in the United States (including Puerto Rico and Guam), Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, The Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Japan, Honduras, New Zealand, Qatar, Philippines, United Arab Emirates, Cura√ßao, and the United Kingdom. Originally opened as a coffee shop under the name Danny's Donuts, Denny's is now known for always being open and serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner around the clock. Denny's does not close on holidays and nights, except where required by law. The organization is known for its advocacy for the privatization of Social Security and senior citizen health programs, as well as its opposition to the estate tax. The organization bills itself as a conservative alternative to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). In the 2012 election, the organization ran a $3.5 million ad campaign which falsely claimed that President Obama had proposed rationing and denial of certain Medicare treatments, and that he would cut $500 billion from Medicare. AARP (formally the American Association of Retired Persons) is a United States-based interest group whose stated mission is "to empower people to choose how they live as they age". According to the organization, it had more than 38 million members as of 2018. The magazine and bulletin it sends to its members are the two largest-circulation publications in the United States. AARP was founded in 1958 by Ethel Percy Andrus (a retired educator from California) and Leonard Davis (later the founder of the Colonial Penn Group of insurance companies).
