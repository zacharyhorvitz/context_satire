 Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine, campaigning together on Saturday for the first time since Labor Day, looked to punish Republicans for standing with Donald Trump, starting with Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey. Campaigning at a high school in Pittsburgh, Clinton slammed Toomey for supporting Trump, arguing that he is putting party in front of country in a political calculation that shows he won't stand with Pennsylvania voters over his party's nominee. The comment is the clearest statement yet that Clinton will look to help Senate Democrats in the final two weeks of the campaign. "He still refuses to stand up to Donald Trump.  Hillary Clinton launched what is expected to be a whirlwind, final stretch of her 2016 campaign on Friday by taking a victory lap in the battleground state of Ohio. Two days after she faced off on the debate stage against Donald Trump for the last time, Clinton reminded voters of her opponent's outlandish comments about the results of the election that have drawn widespread scorn.

He refused to say he would respect the results of this election," Clinton said at a campaign rally in Cleveland.  Sen. Tim Kaine got some Hammer Time Sunday evening. MC Hammer was one of about 15 guests at a Hillary Clinton fundraising dinner featuring the Democratic vice presidential nominee in Leesburg, Virginia, costing $50,000 a person. Hammer tweeted a photo from the event: "Dinner with Sen. Kaine (& friends ) being reminded that were not at the Victory line but must be diligent & vigorous in our pursuit." "That was fun," Kaine told reporters on his way into his Senate office Monday morning.
