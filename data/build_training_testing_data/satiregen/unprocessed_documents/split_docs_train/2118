 Ethan Schmidt and Shannon Lamb taught together at Delta State University. A photo on the school's website shows them standing side by side, smiling at a 2013 holiday party. That same year, Schmidt thanked Lamb in the acknowledgments of his book. Now, Schmidt is dead after someone shot him Monday in his office on the school's campus in Cleveland, Mississippi. Texas's secession from the Union and the American Civil War delayed repayment of the borrowed monies. At the end of the Civil War in 1865, The University of Texas's endowment was just over $16,000 in warrants and nothing substantive had been done to organize the university's operations. This effort to establish a University was again mandated by Article 7, Section 10 of the Texas Constitution of 1876 which directed the legislature to "establish, organize and provide for the maintenance, support and direction of a university of the first class, to be located by a vote of the people of this State, and styled "The University of Texas." Thirty percent of the university's endowment comes from Permanent University Fund (PUF), with nearly $15 billion in assets as of 2007. the University of Texas System gets two-thirds of the Available University Fund, the annual distribution of PUF income. A regental policy requires at least 45 percent of this money go to the university for "program enrichment." By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, UT gets 30 percent which is the minimum amount of AUF income that can be distributed to the school under current policies. The Regents, however, can decide to allocate additional amounts to the university.
