On Rotten Tomatoes, the movie received mixed reviews and gained an approval rating of only 41%, based on 17 reviews, but there is no consensus between the rather harsh reviews of the professional movie critics and the relatively more favourable viewer scores. Robert W. Butler, writing for the Butler's Cinema Scene, notes that "Penn is extraordinary in his depiction of insanity interrupted by spells of rational thought that lead only to crushing guilt. The film's underlying theme is the search for redemption, and Penn fearlessly plumbs those depths.". Tara McNamara, writing for Common Sense Media, mentioned that "Despite the fact that both the star/producer and the director have disavowed it, this isn't a bad film; it's beautifully shot and sensationally acted, and it tells a fascinating real-life story.". Gibson played a na√Øve but ambitious journalist opposite Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hunt in Peter Weir's atmospheric 1982 film The Year of Living Dangerously, based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Koch. The movie was both a critical and commercial success, and the upcoming Australian actor was heavily marketed by MGM studio. In his review of the film, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, "If this film doesn't make an international star of Mr. Gibson, then nothing will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence." In 1995, Gibson produced, directed, and starred in Braveheart, a historical epic, for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, the Academy Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award for Best Picture. He later directed and produced The Passion of the Christ, a biblical drama that was both financially successful and highly controversial. He received further critical notice for his directorial work of the action-adventure film Apocalypto (2006), which is set in Mesoamerica during the early 16th century.
