Bronson Avenue (Ottawa Road #79) is a major north-south arterial road in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It starts as a continuation of the Airport Parkway, which is an expressway to the Macdonald-Cartier International Airport. It continues past Carleton University, the Glebe, north through Centretown, and ends downtown at Sparks Street. Starting as an expressway leading from the Airport Parkway, Bronson quickly becomes a six lane divided principal arterial with little or no direct frontage and a speed limit of 70 km/h (43 mph). The team played at Sam Boyd Stadium in suburban Whitney. As was the problem at many of the other playing fields of the American CFL teams, the end zones at the stadium were only 15 yards long, instead of the usual 20 yards needed for the Canadian game. In addition, the stadium was uncovered and offered no protection from the infamous Las Vegas summer heat. Head coach Ron Meyer was seen at many practices running drills with no shirt on in the sweltering heat. Even as SMU attendance grew, the football team was not immediately successful. Ron Meyer, an up and coming coach who had previous success at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, was hired by SMU in the winter of 1975. In his first four years, Meyer led the Mustangs to a record of just 16â€“27. Seeing that SMU football lacked talent and size, Meyer began to assemble his best recruiting class.
