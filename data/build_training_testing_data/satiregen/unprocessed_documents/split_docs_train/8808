Pence grew up with her parents and siblings in Arlington County, Virginia. Her father Mike encouraged her to be a writer and "cherished" a biography she wrote of him when she was 7. Her mother Karen said that she was a storyteller since she could talk. :1 Pence described her family as "very, very close" and said that " talk about everything together".  President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump visited Walter Reed Medical Center on Saturday, where the President awarded the Purple Heart to a wounded soldier. Trump presented the medal to Sgt. 1st Class Alvaro Barrientos and thanked him on behalf of himself and the first lady. Barrientos' wife, Tammy, was present for the short ceremony.  When I interviewed then-candidate Mike Pence at the Reagan Library during the 2016 campaign he, and we, were told that he would not be taking a tour of the museum. However, once he got there, he wanted to see the museum dedicated to his political hero. So that's what he did. So it should have been no surprise that despite the fact that he, and we, were told that for security reasons, now-Vice President Mike Pence would be limited in his movements at the Korean Demilitarized Zone, when the time actually came, he would push those limits.
