 Hillary Clinton has won Puerto Rico's Democratic primary, putting her on the cusp of clinching the party's presidential nomination. Clinton is not expected to win all 60 delegates that were at stake Sunday, which would have put her over the top in the nomination battle against rival Bernie Sanders. She remains shy of the 2,383 she needs to win the Democratic nomination. Clinton is closing in on a historic nomination as the first female presidential nominee with one more round of states -- California, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Dakota and Montana -- set to vote Tuesday.  Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton met Friday, a day after the Massachusetts senator endorsed the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and called on Democrats to unite behind her. As expected, the two huddled Friday morning at Clinton's Washington, D.C., home. On Thursday, Warren finally endorsed Clinton after being one of the lone hold outs in the Senate. "I'm ready to get in this fight and work my heart out for Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States and to make sure that Donald Trump never gets any place close to the White House," Warren told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow.  Hillary Clinton wants to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination. Just not in Long Beach. Clinton has spent the last three decades waiting for the moment when she could claim the mantle as the the first woman to become the presumptive presidential nominee of a major political party. So when CNN, the Associated Press and others called her race against Bernie Sanders on Monday night, one would think she would celebrate.
