 A deadly winter storm that began in Southern California and stretches to Texas threatens to wreck Thanksgiving week travel plans all the way to the Atlantic. At least six people have lost their lives in traffic crashes blamed on the storm system since late last week. An arctic air mass is expected to keep temperatures 15 to 20 degrees below normal along the East Coast through Thursday. Even if the system fails to deliver heavy snow, it could cause air travel disruptions with high winds, forecasters say.  Armed militants took over three police camps Saturday in northern Kenya, a siege that prompted a significant response by local and national authorities, a Kenyan agency said. The attack was centered in the village of Lorokon in Turkana County, which borders Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north and a sliver of Ethiopia to the northeast. Kenya's National Disaster Operation Centre tweeted that the siege comes on the heels of a border dispute between the Turkana and Pokot peoples. "(Authorities) are combating the bandits in Turkana, but there is heavy resistance," the agency tweeted Saturday evening.  It's ugly out there. And it's only getting uglier. Tuesday has been a mess for much of the East Coast. A massive storm that started in California soaked a huge swath from Florida to New England, with snow and sleet falling in pockets of Pennsylvania and New York.
