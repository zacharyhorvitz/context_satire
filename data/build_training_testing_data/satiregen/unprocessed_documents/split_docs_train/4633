 NASA announced clear evidence that there is liquid water on Mars, in the present day. Water is necessary for life as we know it. On Earth, the first single-celled organisms appeared at least 3.5 billion years ago, almost certainly in an aqueous environment that allowed them to maneuver to find food and energy. Eventually very complex life forms evolved, including humans, whom fossil evidence date back only a couple of hundred thousand years. Over time, proud of their state's contributions to the end of slavery and the preservation of the Union, Kansans embraced the "Jayhawker" term. The term came to be applied to people or items related to Kansas. When the University of Kansas fielded their first football team in 1890, like many universities at that time, they had no official mascot. They used many different independent mascots, including a pig. In September 1861, the town of Osceola, Missouri was burned to the ground by Jayhawkers during the Sacking of Osceola. On the 150th anniversary of that event in 2011, the town asked the University of Kansas to remove the Jayhawk as its mascot. The university refused.
