Rivera Garza’s works have been described as a “disturbing pleasure.” As a writer, she aims to darken thing and make readers suspicious, believing that “there is too much light and clarity in the world” as well as too much communication and messaging. She does not write to create stories, nor to express herself or convince her readers to her point of view. Instead she believes she is producing a kind of reality, agreeing with poet Caridad Ascensio that books provide travel through a state of mind. She does not believe the purpose of fiction is to inform, as there are other ways to do this, but rather she views writing as a physical manifestation of thinking. John and Jill eventually drifted apart and divorced. After this turn of events, John found himself trapped by his own complacency until he was diagnosed with inoperable cancer. Extremely bitter over his squandered life and the loss of his unborn son, John began observing the lives of others and became even more depressed as he saw those around him squandering the gift of life that he had just been denied. John went to a man named William Easton to get money for a cancer treatment, but was denied. While she declines to use words to describe herself, she does state that “I am me and my keyboard.”  She states that her personality is not fixed, and such would be limiting. Rivera Garza maintains interests in narrative, history, and the nature of human language/communication. She believes that writing can be a question of life or death,  and that writers should misbehave in real life as well as in the imagination to be connected to the world and better able to tell stories.
