From 1996 through 1998, the Royal Crown Revue was engaged in a lawsuit with the Amazing Royal Crowns after much confusion with promoters. In accordance with a July 1998 settlement, the latter band changed its name to the Amazing Crowns; in exchange, the Revue agreed to drop the lawsuit. The band was also sued by Royal Crown Cola, and won that suit. Oddly, RC Cola later offered to sell RCR's CD through a series of marketing promotions. In the 1950s, Royal Crown Cola and moon pies were a popular "working man's lunch" in the American South. In 1954, Royal Crown was the first company to sell soft drinks in a can, and later the first company to sell a soft drink in an aluminum can. In 1901, the Cole-Hampton-Hatcher Grocery Store was established in Columbus, Georgia. In 1903, the Hatcher family took sole ownership and the name was changed to the Hatcher Grocery Store. The grocery store was located at what was 22 West 10th Street. Today's address (after house number changes) is 15 West 10th Street.
