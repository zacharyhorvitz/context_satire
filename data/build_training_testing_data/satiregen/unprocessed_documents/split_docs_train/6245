Sometimes called (alternatively attributed to James Brown) "the hardest working man in show business", Philbin holds the Guinness World Record for the most time spent in front of a television camera. His trademarks include his excited manner, his New York accent, his wit, and his irreverent ad-libs. Philbin gained his first network TV exposure in 1967 as Joey Bishop's sidekick on The Joey Bishop Show on television (1967â€“1969). In a Johnny Carson-Ed McMahon vein, Bishop would playfully tease Philbin and he would take the barbs in stride. But his feelings were hurt when he learned from the network grapevine that ABC executives were dissatisfied with his work and his thick accent, so during the opening of one 1968 program, he launched an unplanned diatribe about "not being wanted and letting down" the program and abruptly quit on air. A few nights later, assured by Bishop that all was well and the barbs were not personal, Philbin returned. Walker then moved to New York City, where he became Ornette Coleman's bass guitarist for two and a half years before releasing his debut album. He then toured with Regina Belle, where he soon became musical director. When Belle noticed his voice, she gradually worked his vocals into her act; Walker credits her for teaching him to find his voice.
