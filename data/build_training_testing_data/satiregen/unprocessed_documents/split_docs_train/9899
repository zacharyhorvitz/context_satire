 Ivanka Trump is the eldest daughter of Donald Trump. And a senior adviser in his White House. And, according to her, she could have been the head of the World Bank, too. In an interview with the Associated Press in the Ivory Coast (she's in Africa along with the head of USAID) Ivanka Trump said she talked to her father about the opening but decided against the job -- preferring to stay on in her current role, which has a very fuzzy job description but puts her in the mix on virtually every issue that comes across her father's desk. Sarah Elizabeth Sanders (n√©e Huckabee; born August 13, 1982) is an American campaign manager and political adviser who was the White House press secretary under President Donald Trump. Sanders is the third woman to fill the position.With the release of the Mueller Report in April 2019, it is claimed that Sanders admitted to investigators that she had made false statements to the public as press secretary.On June 13, 2019, President Trump tweeted that Sanders would be leaving her role as press secretary for his administration at the end of the month. After Donald Trump was elected, Sanders was named to the position of deputy White House press secretary in his new administration. On May 5, 2017, she held her first White House press briefing, standing in for Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who was serving on Naval Reserve duty. She continued to cover for Spicer until his return to the podium on May 12. She stood in for Spicer during the dismissal of James Comey and the controversy following it.
