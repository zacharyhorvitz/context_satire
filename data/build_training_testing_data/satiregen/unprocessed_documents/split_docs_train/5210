The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country comprising 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe. Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million, the U.S. is the third most populous country.  Working hard at a job, traveling for business and trying to move up the career ladder can make doing everything else in life that much tougher. Unless, of course, you have some flexibility in how you structure your job -- especially in terms of when and where you work. And that's exactly what workers say they want, according to a new EY survey of 9,700 full-time employees in eight of the world's largest economies:  the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, India, China and Japan. They listed flexibility as a top feature they want in a job -- ranked just behind competitive pay and benefits.  If politicians feel unloved in America, they should try Britain. Here, voters castigate politicians as liars on live television, tell pollsters by 10-1 margins that their leaders don't care for the national interest and have descended into a corrosive countrywide funk challenging the very legitimacy of government. Now the electorate may add a dose of Washington-style gridlock with a May 7 vote likely to leave no big winner and instead produce a fractious coalition or a weak government without a mandate that would struggle to survive, let alone get anything done.
