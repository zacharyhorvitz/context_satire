At his first audience on 16 March 2013, Francis told journalists that he had chosen the name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, and had done so because he was especially concerned for the well-being of the poor. He explained that, as it was becoming clear during the conclave voting that he would be elected the new bishop of Rome, the Brazilian Cardinal Cláudio Hummes had embraced him and whispered, "Don't forget the poor", which had made Bergoglio think of the saint. Bergoglio had previously expressed his admiration for St. Francis, explaining that "He brought to Christianity an idea of poverty against the luxury, pride, vanity of the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the time. He changed history."

Bergoglio had previously expressed his admiration for St. Francis, explaining that “He brought to Christianity an idea of poverty against the luxury, pride, vanity of the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the time. He changed history." Francis from the start of his papacy has attacked the harm done to the poor by what he calls the sin of market speculation. Back in Buenos Aires he was known as the "slum bishop" because of his frequent visits to shantytowns. Since becoming pope he has been saying that his church should be closer to the poor, and has been attacking the global economic system based on "a god of money". He told the United Nations leaders that the organization's future sustainable development goals should stress the "structural causes of poverty and hunger".
