Conrad Hilton Jr. was born in Dallas, Texas. His father, Conrad Hilton, was the founder of Hilton Hotels, and his mother was the former Mary Adelaide Barron. Hilton grew up with three siblings: William Barron Hilton, Eric Michael Hilton and Constance Francesca Hilton. He was the great-uncle of Paris and Nicky Hilton. Over the next decade, he expanded west to California and east to Chicago and New York, crowning his expansions with such acquisitions as the Stevens Hotel in Chicago (then the world's largest hotel, it was renamed the Conrad Hilton), and the fabled Waldorf-Astoria in New York. He formed the Hilton Hotels Corporation in 1946, and Hilton International Company in 1948. On September 21, 2010, on their way to a Tokyo press conference to promote fashion and fragrance lines, Hilton and her sister Nicky were stopped by immigration officers at Narita Airport because of Hilton's drug-possession conviction the previous day. Under Japan's strict drug laws, travelers convicted of a drug crime are usually denied entry into the country. Airport officials questioned Hilton "for hours", and she and Nicky were detained overnight at the airport hotel. On September 22 Japanese authorities denied Hilton entry, and she was put on a plane back to the United States.
