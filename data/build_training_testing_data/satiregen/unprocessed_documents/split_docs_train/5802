From 1975 to 1976 small numbers of Coupe de Villes were converted into car-based pick-ups, similar to a Chevrolet El Camino, but much more upscale. Coachbuilding company Traditional Coach Works manufactured 204 of these, called the Cadillac Mirage, to Cadillac's standards, such that one could be ordered through a participating Cadillac dealer. The floor bed could carry flat plywood 4 x 8 sheets with the tailgate closed, while the two-seat front cabin offered driver and passenger a plush ride.

The reviews for the fourth generation Escalade's redesign has been met with positive results from automotive critics. USA Today's James R. Healey and Fred Meier noted that "The once-unthinkable big Cadillac SUV has become indispensable." CNET's Antuan Goodwin notes that "Fans of the Escalade will appreciate the automaker's sticking with the original message and not "ruining" its former flagship, but if you already think the giant luxury SUV is a relic of the past, there's nothing in the 2015 Escalade that will convince you that it's anything but an old dog that's learned a few cool new tricks." Carscoops noted that "It may have impressed us more if a) it had shown the Escalade first instead of last, after the Chevrolet and GMC models or b) if the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon and Yukon XL simply did not existâ€¦" and added that Cadillac has won their attention with the redesign. In the final scene of the King of the Hill episode "Hank Gets Dusted," Hank Hill has his father's Cadillac, which he cherished growing up, pushed front first into a hole along with other Cadillacs to reference the Cadillac Ranch.
