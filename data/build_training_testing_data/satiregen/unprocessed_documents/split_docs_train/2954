Adolfas Mekas (30 September 1925 â€“ 31 May 2011) was a Lithuanian-born American filmmaker, writer, director, editor, actor and educator. With his brother Jonas Mekas, he founded the magazine Film Culture, as well as the Film-Makers' Cooperative and was associated with George Maciunas and the Fluxus art movement at its beginning. He made several short films, culminating in the feature Hallelujah the Hills in 1963, which was played at the Cannes Film Festival of that year and is now considered a classic of American film. Empire is a 1964 black-and-white silent film by Andy Warhol. When projected according to Warhol's specifications, it consists of eight hours and five minutes of slow motion footage of an unchanging view of the Empire State Building. The film does not have conventional narrative or characters, and largely reduces the experience of cinema to the passing of time. Warhol stated that the purpose of the film was "to see time go by." As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally I Saw Brief Glimpses of Beauty is a 2000 experimental documentary film directed by Jonas Mekas. The film had its world premiere on November 4, 2000, at the London Film Festival and is a compilation of Mekas' home movies. At almost five hours in length, it is one of the longest experimental films ever made.
