On January 8, 2009, President-elect Barack Obama nominated Lynn as his Deputy Secretary of Defense. This was complicated by the fact that new ethic rules promulgated by Obama for members of his administration created a waiting period of two years between lobbying activities and working for the administration on the same issues, which Lynn's work with Raytheon violated. President Obama waived the new rules for Lynn, which received criticism from John McCain as well as outside groups such as the Project on Government Oversight, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Government Accountability Project, and Public Citizen. McCain later said that the nomination should probably move forward. William J. Lynn III (born January 1, 1954) is a former United States Deputy Secretary of Defense.
