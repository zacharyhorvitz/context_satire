Omar Dean was a 20-year-old contestant from Melbourne, Victoria who auditioned for The X Factor singing "Climax" by Usher. Dean stated that his "own desire and passion" and encouragement from family and friends inspired him to audition. At the age of 15, Dean was bullied at school for being overweight. He turned to music to cope with the bullying. Jai Waetford was a 14-year-old contestant from Campbelltown, New South Wales who sang two songs at his audition. The first was "Different Worlds" by Jes Hudak and the second was an original song titled "Don't Let Me Go". Waetford's family and friends inspired him to audition for The X Factor. He lived with his mother Alana Dow and grandparents Hannah and Roger Dow. "We didn't want it to be called 'the Lisas,' either," singer Lisa Origliasso added. "So one day we saw the movie Heathers, and there's a line where Christian Slater asks, 'Are you a Heather?' and Winona Ryder's character  answers, 'No, I'm a Veronica,' and so we went with that, because she was this kind of cool, unique chick with an attitude."
