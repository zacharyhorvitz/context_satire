Gomez appeared on the radio program On Air with Ryan Seacrest and told Seacrest that she had "a million ideas and it’s just going to be cooler and it’s going to be stronger and it’s going to be better." She later told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show that the album will have a "sense of strong pop", and that she experimented with electric guitar. She also told Fallon that it took her "four years now to even feel at a good place with this album." Midway through the album's recording process, Gomez went on a trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico with Hit-Boy and a few members of his producing team, as well as Rock Mafia and songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels. According to her, "it was all of us in one house for five or six days. We would go out, listen to live music, and go back and create in this studio – in a closet, basically." During the creative process Gomez wanted "to get out of her head." In an interview to Entertainment Weekly, Gomez stated that she was influenced by a wide range of artists growing up, from Janet Jackson to Britney Spears and NSYNC. She commented that her main influence for the record was Christina Aguilera, specifically her 2002 release Stripped, which she cites as an exemplar of a "complete" album and inspired her own decision to tell a story through Revival. Gomez further commented on her life in the media: "Now, I’m in the place of my life where I released an album at 16—nobody’s going to relate . They’re going to be like, 'Great, what are you singing about?'
