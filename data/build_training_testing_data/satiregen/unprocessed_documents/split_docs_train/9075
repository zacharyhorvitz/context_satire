During the first 2008 series, however, the mysterious suitcase was no longer the prize one of the two players left could take. Starting from €0 (later €1,000 see below), the amount of money awarded to a player who eliminates themselves rises up to a certain amount, chosen beforehand, after which the players cannot eliminate themselves freely anymore. If a player buzzes before the money rise has ended, the player will receive the amount of money it had risen to up to that point. If no player eliminates themselves, the contestants will receive a calculation, which they will have to answer correctly to proceed to the final round. The program is about 10 candidates, who have to complete assignments by which they can earn money. However, one of the group members is the Mole. The other candidates do not know who the mole is, and need to unmask them. The mole's goal is to make the assignments fail and keep the amount of money earned as low as possible. De Mol, a well-known personality in the Netherlands, acquired his fortune producing television programmes. In 1997–1999 he developed the highly popular reality television series Big Brother with his eponymous production company, John de Mol Produkties. In 1994 his company merged with Joop van den Ende TV-Producties into Endemol, but it still functioned on its own. He also produced Fear Factor, Love Letters, 1 vs. 100 and Deal or No Deal (Miljoenenjacht) for Endemol.
