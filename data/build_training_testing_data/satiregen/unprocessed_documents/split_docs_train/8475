Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy at University of the Pacific Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry. The library consists of collection of 1,400 human skulls collected over past 40 years. Atkinson is also known for developing the Universal Appliance in the 1960s which led to eventual formation of the Unitek Division of 3M Company. Blue Bell is known for its large executive-style homes, major business parks, community shopping facilities, and small businesses. It is one of the most affluent areas outside the Main Line communities in the Philadelphia area.
