 The same day that a gunman opened fire on an early-morning crowd in a Dayton, Ohio, nightlife district, residents attending a vigil for the victims of the shooting shouted at Gov. Mike DeWine to "do something." As DeWine gave brief remarks on a stage in the Oregon District of Dayton on Sunday, he was met with repeated calls for action from the crowd. "We are here tonight because we know that we cannot ease the pain of those families who have lost someone," DeWine said at the vigil honoring the nine killed and 27 injured in the carnage.  An Ohio Republican state lawmaker on Sunday blamed mass shootings in the US on former President Barack Obama, "fatherlessness," video games and "drag queen advocates" following two shootings this weekend in Texas and Ohio that left more than 30 dead. The state's Republican Party is now calling for her resignation. The comments from state Rep. Candice Keller -- whose district is close to Dayton, Ohio, where a gunman opened fire early Sunday in a popular downtown area, leaving nine dead -- were made in a now-deleted Facebook post on her personal account after the Ohio massacre occurred, according to the Dayton Daily News. The Dayton shooting, as well as a weekend attack in El Paso, Texas, have reignited a national discussion about the causes of gun violence.  President Donald Trump on Sunday weighed in on two mass shootings that occurred 13 hours apart in Texas and Ohio, acknowledging "perhaps more has to be done" to address gun violence. "We've done actually a lot," Trump told reporters of his administration's work on the issue, "but perhaps more has to be done." Trump, who made the comments to reporters on a tarmac in New Jersey after a weekend spent at his golf club in Bedminster, has overseen a ban on so-called bump stocks, but has not pursued large-scale gun control efforts. His predecessor, President Barack Obama, took executive actions on gun control, including on background checks and mental health.
