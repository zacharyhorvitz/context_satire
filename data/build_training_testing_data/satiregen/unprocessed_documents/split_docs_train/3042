 For the first time ever, Apple unveiled two new iPhones on Tuesday, a traditional upgrade of its iPhone 5 as well as a simpler, cheaper version. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C are a reaction to a changing smartphone market. "Business has become so large that this year we are going to replace the iPhone 5 and we're going to replace it with not one, but two new designs," Cook said. "This allows us to serve even more customers."  Investors were optimistic Tuesday ahead of a much-anticipated Apple event, where the tech giant is expected to announce some new iPhone offerings. U.S. stock futures were higher ahead of the opening bell. Shares of Apple inched higher in premarket trading amid expectations the company will release the next generation of iPhones, rumored to be colorful and cheaper to produce. The event is being held at 1 p.m.  Apple's innovation problem is real. And it's unlikely to silence the critics if it simply unveils multi-colored iPhones on Tuesday. Rivals have caught up to Apple in the markets it once dominated, and the tech giant's rumored future products appear to be more evolutionary than revolutionary. A smartwatch and an "iTV" are intriguing, but they're niche products that won't set the world on fire like the iPhone and iPad did.
