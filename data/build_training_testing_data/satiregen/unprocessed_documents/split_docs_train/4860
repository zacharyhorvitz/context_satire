Initially the film was titled Down and Under and was shot as an R-rated mob comedy in the style of Midnight Run. The film was shot in Australia in August 2001, and originally included cursing, sex, and violence, and only one scene with a kangaroo. However, when the film's producers saw the first rough cut, they realized that it wasn't working as expected. Inspired by positive response to the kangaroo scene in early test screenings, as well as the marketing campaign behind the recently released Snow Dogs, the production shifted the marketing focus away from that of a dark mafia comedy to that of a family-friendly animal picture. He is an anthropomorphic rapping kangaroo who had a previous encounter with Charlie Carbone and Louis Booker from the original film (though the sequel is usually canon). An animal with a love for candy, he is a friend to Charlie, Jessie and Louis, and is currently living in the Australian outback along with his family. Bay's success in music videos gained the attention of producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, who selected him to direct his first feature-length film, Bad Boys. The film was shot in Miami in 1994 and starred Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The action film proved to be a break-out role for Smith, who was segueing from television to films at that time. Shooting in Miami was a good experience for Bay, who would later own a home in the city and spend a great deal of time there.
