Since the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is worldwide, there are volunteers in the nation affected that can provide help in disaster situations. However, the British Red Cross, in common with other national societies, sends paid personnel abroad, called delegates, who have specialised skills such as in logistics, to assist the agencies in the aftermath of a major international disaster. This is in addition to resources the British Red Cross can provide, in co-operation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Until September 28, 1998, the Canadian Red Cross was responsible for all blood services in Canada. On the recommendation of the Krever Commission, the organization was removed from this position and replaced by the Canadian Blood Services. This was due to nationwide controversy when it was revealed that the Canadian Red Cross had  supplied, between 1986 and 1990, blood which it knew might be tainted with Hepatitis C and HIV. The American Red Cross in the war was a quasi state organization however it is best described as a Non Governmental Organizational as it was not officially part of the United States  Government. The Red Cross in the war focussed principally on overseas civilian aid and not domestic disaster relief. The Red Cross spent "less than one million dollars on domestic disaster relief, in comparison to the $120 million devoted to relief overseas. The Red Cross during the war provided food, employment, housing and medical assistance to millions of civilians displaced by the war.
