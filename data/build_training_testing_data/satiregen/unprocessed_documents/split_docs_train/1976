1857Dr. A. J. Bowie, especially skilled in plastic and bone surgery, resigns from the Navy to work at St. Mary's and Marine Hospital. The leading medical journal of the time writes, "It cannot be denied that San Francisco and Dr. A. J. Bowie lead the surgical world in the success of operations upon bones." St. Mary Hospital was opened on January 8, 1863 as a community hospital by the Poor Sisters of St. Francis, a religious congregation founded in 1845 in Germany. The hospital was opened during the American Civil War as a location to treat the returning wounded and was the second hospital ever to open in the State of New Jersey and is now its longest operating. The Sisters purchased five lots at Fourth and Willow Streets for this purpose. The money to pay for the land was raised though donations. In 1923, the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word answered the call from Rev. J.M. Hegarty, pastor at St. Anthonyâ€™s, to care for the sick and poor in Long Beach, by purchasing what is now St. Mary Medical Center from Dr. T.O. Boyd.
