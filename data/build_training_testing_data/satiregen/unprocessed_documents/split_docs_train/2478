 When voters go to the polls Tuesday in the heavily Democratic state of California, they will see three words next to the name of Donald J. Trump: "Republican, American Independent."

Donald Trump delivered the weekly Republican address Saturday, continuing a tradition for the GOP nominee on the weekend before Election Day. Trump, who rose to political fame promoting an outsider persona, has held a factitious relationship with party leaders and has at times struggled to unite the GOP around his nomination. But polls are tightening in the final stretch before Tuesday, and in his address, Trump promoted a message of unity, saying he would work with a Republican Congress to "finally deliver the change the American people deserve." That includes many proposals from his stump speech, including the creation of new jobs, reducing taxes, repealing and replacing Obamacare, suspending the Syrian refugee program, and ending federal funding to sanctuary cities.  Donald Trump on Sunday warned his supporters in this border state that Hillary Clinton "wants to let people just pour in," saying without evidence that hundreds of millions of people could enter the US under a Clinton presidency. And speaking just nine days before Election Day, the Republican nominee also bemoaned criticism of waterboarding and appeared to once again call for bringing back the since-banned technique for use in the fight against ISIS. "These savages are chopping off heads, drowning people. This is medieval times and then we can't do waterboarding?
