 A new anti-terrorism law in Egypt will make publishing news that contradicts the official version of events in terrorism-related cases a crime punishable by prison sentences, a setback for the freedom of the press, according to the local journalists union. The anti-terrorism draft law lists more than 25 crimes, 12 of which are punishable by death. It was approved by the Cabinet and the State Council and is pending the approval of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, who has legislative powers in the absence of a parliament. A terrorist attack on military outposts in Sinai led to an hourslong battle in a town near the Gaza border, killing at least 17 soldiers and over 200 militants on July 1, the military said.  Israeli authorities and relatives of a man believed to have been held against his will in Gaza for nearly a year have appealed for the Palestinian militant group Hamas to free him. Avera Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli citizen, has been in Gaza since September 7, according to the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, or COGAT, the Israeli government division that deals with the West Bank and Gaza. Mengistu entered the coastal enclave "by his own initiative" only weeks after the end of last summer's Gaza war, said a spokesman for COGAT administrator Yoav Mordechai. The case has been made public following the lifting of a gag order.  The group assembles every Tuesday, toting fabric, needles, the occasional rhubarb pie and their "Iowans Ready for Hillary" pins. For two hours, they talk 2016 while stitching a very political quilt. "This is a supporter quilt. It's kind of a way to say to Hillary, 'We've got your back,'" Iowan Clara Oleson said.
