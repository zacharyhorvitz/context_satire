The Scripps National Spelling Bee (formerly the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee and commonly called the National Spelling Bee) is an annual spelling bee held in the United States. The bee is run on a not-for-profit basis by The E. W. Scripps Company and is held at a hotel or convention center in Washington, D.C. during the week following Memorial Day weekend. Since 2011, it has been held at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center hotel in National Harbor in Oxon Hill, Maryland, just outside Washington D.C. It was previously held at the Grand Hyatt Washington in Washington D.C. from 1996 to 2010. The morning rounds of day three reduced the field to 16 finalists, which then competed in the evening finals. The winner was Karthik Nemmani, an eighth grader from McKinney, Texas, who correctly spelled "koinonia" for the win. 12-year-old Naysa Modi, a fourth-time speller from Frisco, Texas, placed second, falling on the word "Bewusstseinslage". The two finalists were both from the Dallas area; Nemmani was a wild-card entrant under this year's new rules, after losing his county spelling bee to Modi. The competition was won by 13-year-old eighth grader Sai R. Gunturi of Dallas, sponsored by the Dallas Morning News, who correctly spelled rhathymia followed by pococurante for the win. He had happened to have studied the final word previously, so knew he was going to win. He won $12,000 as well as additional prizes. It was Gunturi's fourth trip to the bee, improving his performance every year.
