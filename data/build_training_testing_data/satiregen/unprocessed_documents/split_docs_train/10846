 Donald Trump says "I'm ready, I'm absolutely ready" to face Megyn Kelly at Thursday's Republican debate. The two have not spoken since the day they clashed at a debate last August. Fox isn't calling it a rematch, but everyone else is. The face-off is expected to be one of the highest-rated GOP debates of the season thus far.  Republican presidential hopefuls got animated Thursday night, defending their positions and attacking each other at a Fox News debate in Detroit. If you missed it, here are the highlights in GIF form. There were only four participants this time: Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.  After Super Tuesday comes Super Thursday: Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly's rematch at the next GOP debate. The GOP frontrunner and the Fox News host will meet for the first time since August 6, when Trump objected to the questions Kelly asked at the first Republican primary debate of the season. Trump has criticized Kelly off and on ever since, sometimes harshly, other times dismissively. At one point Fox called his attacks "disturbing" and said he should apologize.
