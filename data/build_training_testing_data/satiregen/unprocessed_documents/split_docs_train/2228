 A group of six Michigan voters are wrestling with what kind of Democratic candidate they believe can take on President Donald Trump in 2020. Five Democrats and one independent voter, some of whom worked on Democratic campaigns, sat down with CNN on "New Day" to size up the Democratic field ahead of CNN's Democratic presidential debates in Detroit Tuesday and Wednesday night. The panel exemplifies the struggle among Democrats as to whether their nominee should be moderate or more progressive, practical or bold, in their desire to beat Trump in 2020. Edith Suttles likes former Vice President Joe Biden so far, because she believes he's "competent politically" and "solid in foreign relations."  Sen. Bernie Sanders said Sunday he is "not happy" he voted for the controversial 1994 crime bill. "No, I'm not happy I voted for a terrible bill," the 2020 presidential hopeful said when asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union" in an exclusive interview if he was glad he voted for the bill. But, he said, "I am happy I was honest with the people of my state." The Vermont senator running for the Democratic nomination said the bill had a ban on assault weapons and a provision that addressed violence against women, which he said he had campaigned on in 1988 and 1990.  Former Vice President Joe Biden said Thursday he was surprised by the "degree of the criticism" against former President Barack Obama at Wednesday's CNN Democratic debate. Asked about attacks from 2020 rivals, Biden told reporters in Detroit, "I expected it." But, he added, "I was a little surprised how much the incoming was about Barack." Some Democratic candidates on Wednesday night raised Obama's immigration policies and the millions of deportations that occurred during his presidency as a way to challenge Biden, who has used his time as Obama's vice president as a centerpiece of his pitch to progressives.
