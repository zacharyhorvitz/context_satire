 Senate negotiators announced Tuesday that they had reached a tentative agreement on a multi-year, multi-billion bill to fund highway construction ahead of a deadline at the end of the month when the current funding expires. But Senate Democrats blocked taking up the agreement right away so they could have additional time to study the deal. Quick passage of the agreement is also complicated by a pair of unrelated but contentious issues two Republican presidential candidates want to debate as part of the bill -- funding for Planned Parenthood and the Export-Import Bank. "Senators from both parties know that a long-term highway bill is in the best interest of our country. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution disqualifies from the Senate any federal or state officers who had taken the requisite oath to support the Constitution, but later engaged in rebellion or aided the enemies of the United States. This provision, which came into force soon after the end of the Civil War, was intended to prevent those who had sided with the Confederacy from serving. That Amendment, however, also provides a method to remove that disqualification: a two-thirds vote of both chambers of Congress. The United States House of Representatives is the lower house of the United States Congress, the Senate being the upper house. Together they compose the national legislature of the United States.
