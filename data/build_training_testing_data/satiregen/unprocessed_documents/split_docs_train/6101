Jimmy again brings up the topic that Tom needs to be more strict with his kids. Tom is angered by this, and he and Jimmy decide to settle the matter at the Annual Labor Day Family Cup. Tom trains the kids for days, not realizing they are miserable. Sarah and Elliot Murtaugh watch Ice Age together, but are spied on by their fathers, which ultimately results in them getting into an argument and humiliating their children. On August 31, 2019, The Chris Kyle Memorial Benefit & Auction Facebook page, managed by Chris's father and mother Wayne and Deby Kyle, posted a photograph with a caption referencing Taya Kyle's refusal to let Chris's parents see their grandchildren - "Let me introduce the Kyle Family, Wayne & Deby, Jeff & Amy and their girls. There are 3 Kyle Family members missing from this picture, Chris & Jeffâ€™s Granny who has been a regular at the Benefit except this year due to health reasons, and Chris's son and daughter, our grandson and granddaughter, who we haven't been allowed to see for over 3 years which tears our hearts apart each and every day." The next morning, Tom goes to the Cup to compete with Nigel and Kyle, the only two still willing to go. However, after discovering an old "Team Baker" flag, Kate and the rest of the kids show up, showing they forgive him and are willing to compete. After the events, however, the Bakers and the Murtaughs are tied for first; a tiebreaking canoe race is announced, in which every family member must compete. During the canoe race, Nora goes into labor; the Murtaughs want to help, but Jimmy, sensing the opportunity to defeat Tom once and for all, refuses to do so.
