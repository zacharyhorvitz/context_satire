 It's been just three months since marijuana was legalized in Colorado, but economists don't think the state will raise as much in taxes as was hoped. They had expected to raise $22.7 million before July from special sales taxes on recreational marijuana, but state economist Larson Silbaugh is skeptical. About $3.4 million was raised in January and February, the only months for which sales have been reported so far. "If current tax revenues keep coming in at the same pace, we won't meet that expectation," Silbaugh said.  What role, if any, did legally purchased and consumed marijuana play in a husband's alleged murder of his wife this week in Denver? That's what police are investigating in the shooting death of Kristine Kirk, who called 911 Monday and, according to a police affidavit, said her husband, Richard Kirk, was hallucinating after he had "taken some marijuana." "This is under investigation," Denver police spokeswoman Raquel Lopez said about the possibility of marijuana use. Kristine Kirk, 44,  told a 911 operator that her husband also may have been on some prescription medication for back pain, according to a police affidavit.
