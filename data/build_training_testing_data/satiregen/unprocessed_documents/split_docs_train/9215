The University of Michigan (UM, U-M, U of M, or UMich), often simply referred to as Michigan, is a  public research university in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The university is Michigan's oldest; it was founded in 1817 in Detroit, as the Catholepistemiad, or University of Michigania, 20 years before the territory became a state. The school was moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 onto 40 acres (16 ha) of what is now known as Central Campus. Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the flagship university campus has expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than 34 million gross square feet (780 acres; 3.2 km2) spread out over a Central Campus and North Campus, two regional campuses in Flint and Dearborn, and a Center in Detroit.

The thought of establishing a part of the University of Michigan in the city of Flint started in the year 1837 when Sarah Miles wrote a letter to her family stating, "A branch of the Michigan University at Ann Arbor is to be established in Flint at some future day." In May 1944 the Flint Board of Education requested that the University of Michigan open a satellite campus in Flint. In June 1944, Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the G.I. Bill into law.
