 For three days, Clackamas Town Center has been a crime scene. On Friday, it will be a shopping mall, once again. Yet the Oregon shopping center's scheduled 9 a.m. reopening -- announced on its Facebook page -- does not close the books on the many questions tied to Tuesday's fatal shooting. Investigators have identified Jacob Tyler Roberts, 22, as the man responsible for the bloodshed and panic at the mall, located in the community of Happy Valley, about 10 miles southeast of Portland.  The gunman shot three people on the second floor of an Oregon mall, then ran. Shoppers hid behind racks as the man, wearing a vest and a mask, ran down a corridor and to a back hallway that led downstairs. By then, he likely heard the sirens as dozens of police vehicles converged on the Clackamas Town Center in Happy Valley. He then took his own life.  On Tuesday, a masked gunman opened fire in a suburban Portland, Oregon mall that police say was full of nearly ten-thousand people. According to the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office, three people were killed, including the shooter who died of a self-inflicted gunshot. One young woman suffered a traumatic injury. This morning Austin Patty, a employee at the Macy’s inside the Clackamas Town center joins “Starting Point” to talk about his experience inside the store at the time of the shooting.
