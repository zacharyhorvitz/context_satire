 The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have named their third child Louis Arthur Charles, a choice that confounded expectations. Prince Louis (pronounced Loo-ee) is fifth in line to the British throne, after grandfather Prince Charles, father Prince William and  his two older siblings. "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son Louis Arthur Charles," Kensington Palace said in a statement. "The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, the wife of Prince William, gave birth to the couple's third child on Monday, a son who becomes the fifth in line to the British throne. The Duke of Cambridge was present for the birth, at 11 a.m. local time at St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, Kensington Palace said. The newest arrival to the royal family weighs 8lbs 7oz (3.8 kilograms), and both mother and baby are "doing well," according to the Palace. "The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and members of both families have been informed and are delighted with the news," Kensington Palace said in a statement on Twitter.  What's in a name? A lot, if you happen to be a member of Britain's royal family. As the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Monday announced the arrival of their son and third child, speculation turned to a possible name. The baby boy was born at St. Mary's Hospital in London at 11 a.m. local time, Kensington Palace said in a statement.
