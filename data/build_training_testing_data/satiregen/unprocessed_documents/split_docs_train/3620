 Hamas wants an end to Israel's long blockade of Gaza and raids on the territory in any cease-fire that might put a stop to five days of weaponry plummeting from the sky, a top Palestinian official said Sunday. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, said an Israeli airstrike killed a family of 10 on Sunday. Israel, meanwhile, said Hamas had fired nearly 150 rockets into Israel in a single day, and that the strike was aimed at killing one of the leaders of the militant group's rocket corps -- but Israel was unsure whether he was among the dead. It was the latest violence in what has become a daily nightmare for millions in the region, one that puts Gaza's 1.7 million residents and millions of Israelis in harm's way. Fighting spread in the Gaza Strip, with both factions attacking vehicles and facilities of the other side. Following a breakdown in an Egyptian-brokered truce, Israel launched an air strike which destroyed a building used by Hamas. Ongoing violence prompted fear that it could bring the end of the Fatah-Hamas coalition government, and possibly the end of the Palestinian authority.  Crowds in Gaza are taking to the streets, celebrating a cease fire that appears to be holding between Israel and Hamas after eight days of rockets and airstrikes. Talks are set to begin today on easing economic restrictions on Gaza as part of the agreement. Mark Regev joins us from the CNN Bureau in Jerusalem with the latest.
