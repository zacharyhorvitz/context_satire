Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a positive review, calling it the best Netflix film to date and praising Sandler's performance, writing: "With no shtick to fall back on, Sandler is forced to act, and it’s a glorious thing to watch – even for those fans who like him best in perpetual man-child mode (don’t worry: the character is a full-grown variation on that familiar Sandler prototype)." Other critics were equal with their praise of Sandler, with various outlets calling his performance a "triumph," "miraculously great" and that "it's time to admit that Adam Sandler is actually a good actor." In her round-up of the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, Wendy Ide of The Guardian ranked Uncut Gems as one of the best films of the year, calling it "Audacious, thrilling and exhausting" and Sandler's "remarkable performance" as one of the best performances of the year, and praising the cinematography. Kevin Garnett's performance in his movie debut was also received positively. Brady Langmann of Esquire called it the year's best breakout performance and Alan Siegel wrote on The Ringer that it was "one of the best acting performances by an athlete ever." Covert's first film role was a cruise ship bartender in Sandler's 1989 film Going Overboard which also was Sandler's first cinematic appearance, he played Shecky, who aspired to be the cruise ships house comedian. Covert had minor parts in several subsequent Sandler films before his first prominent role in 1998's The Wedding Singer alongside Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Covert would continue to have fairly large roles in Sandler's next four films, including one in Little Nicky for which he gained 40 pounds. He eventually settled back into smaller walk-on and single-scene appearances in Sandler's films beginning with 50 First Dates in 2004.
