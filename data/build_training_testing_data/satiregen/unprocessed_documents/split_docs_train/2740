The report also said that Home Office officials should have been aware of, and addressed, the problem much earlier. Cross-party MPs on the committee noted that the Home Office had taken no action during the months in which the issue had been highlighted in the press. By late May 2018, the government had contacted 3 out of the 63 people possibly wrongly deported, and on 8 June, Seth George Ramocan, the Jamaican high commissioner in London said he had still not received either the numbers or the names of those people the Home Office believed they had wrongly deported to Jamaica, so that Jamaican records could be checked for contact details. By late June, long delays were being reported in processing "leave to remain" applications due to the large numbers of people contacting the Home Office. The Windrush hotline had recorded 19,000 calls up to that time, 6,800 of which were identified as potential Windrush cases. 1,600 people had by then been issued documentation after having appointments with the Home Office. On 18 July 2012, the Public and Commercial Services Union announced that thousands of Home Office employees would go on strike over jobs, pay and other issues. However, the PCSU called off the strike before it was planned it claimed the department had, subsequent to the threat of actions, announced 1,100 new border jobs.
