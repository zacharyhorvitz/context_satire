In 1910 Greenwich consolidated its small local districts into one large one covering the whole town. Expansions to the mills had nearly doubled Glenville's population, with more Polish immigrants coming in, and the school building became overcrowded. The building's neglect and its educational impact, such as classes held in hallways, was the subject of a state report and then a scathing article on June 16, 1912 in The New York Times. Called "Rich Greenwich Spends More on Tires than Schools," it deplored how affluent Greenwich, which relied on philanthropy for much of its school funding, did not keep schools in working-class neighborhoods up to the same standards as those in richer ones. In September 2019, more than thirty years after the last graduating class at Sylva-Webster, the first annual Sylva-Webster Fest was held at Bridge Park in Sylva. This event culminated when the older classes formed a committee regarding the interest in having a class-wide reunion and from there, bloomed one of the best class reunionever imagined and over 500 in attendance from the combined classes.
