The championship was introduced on the May 20, 2019, episode of Monday Night Raw, during which Titus O'Neil from Raw became the inaugural champion by securing the title belt first in a scramble involving several other wrestlers. The current champion is Riddick Moss, who is in his first reign. He won the title by pinning Mojo Rawley on Raw in Ontario, California on February 10, 2020. In early September 1991, Davis checked into St. John's Hospital near his home in Santa Monica, California, for routine tests. Doctors suggested he have a tracheal tube implanted to relieve his breathing after repeated bouts of bronchial pneumonia. The suggestion provoked an outburst from Davis that led to an intracerebral hemorrhage followed by a coma. After several days on life support, his machine was turned off and he died on September 28, 1991. In a 2019 interview marking his 70th birthday, Joel commented on why he rarely plays the song anymore: "He didn’t age well. Captain Jack’s been demoted to Private Jack. In the verses, there’s only two chords, and it goes on and on, and it’s kind of a dreary song if you think of the lyrics. The kid is sitting home jerkin’ off.
