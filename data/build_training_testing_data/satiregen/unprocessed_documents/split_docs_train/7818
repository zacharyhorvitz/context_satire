 Ben Carson is calling on the five Republican presidential candidates to all gather and bury their hatchets before Thursday night's debate in Detroit. In a statement, Carson, a long-shot in a race dominated by Donald Trump, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, said that "this race has taken a turn for the worse, to the point of embarrassment on the world stage." He blamed the race's negativity -- which in recent days has featured Trump mocking Rubio's perspiration and Rubio joking about the size of Trump's fingers -- on the media. "If we are to defeat our Democratic opponent in the general election this November, we must reach an agreement together with each other that we will not succumb to the media's desire for a fight on the stage in Detroit," Carson said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.  Ben Carson on Friday officially ended his presidential campaign and revealed his next move: chairing a group focused on getting out the Christian vote in November. "Even though I might be leaving the campaign trail, you know there's a lot of people who love me. They just won't vote for me," Carson told the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering in National Harbor, Maryland. "But it's OK.  A super PAC supporting Ben Carson on Thursday sent out a fundraising email to supporters saying the candidate needs to be on the Republican ticket -- even as the vice presidential nominee -- in order to capture the minority vote. The email, signed by 2016 Committee National Chairman John Philip Sousa IV, said that the race is still "in flux" but if Carson isn't on the ticket, "The Democrats will win the White House and the America we love will disappear." Sousa said front-runner Donald Trump and Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz can't win without Carson, who has thus far lagged behind the field in the early nominating states.
