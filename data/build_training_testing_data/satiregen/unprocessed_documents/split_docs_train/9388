 November is National Native American Heritage Month. It's a time to recognize the many sacrifices, contributions and achievements of Native American people, as well as celebrate their rich and vibrant cultures. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush approved a joint resolution designating November as "National American Indian Heritage Month." The meaning of the word American in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. American is derived from America, a term originally denoting all of the New World (also called the Americas). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the United States of America. In modern English, American generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification.  "American Son" possesses considerable power in its premise, while wrestling with the claustrophobic aspects of transferring a stage play to the screen. Ultimately, the subject matter wins out, yielding a flawed but brisk 90-minute Netflix presentation that reunites the cast headed by Kerry Washington. The entire drama unfolds within a Miami police station in the wee hours of the morning, where Washington's Kendra is introduced frantically calling her just-turned-18-year-old son, Jamal, who isn't answering. Desperate for answers, she vents at the officer on duty (Jeremy Jordan), who won't provide any useful information about her missing son.
