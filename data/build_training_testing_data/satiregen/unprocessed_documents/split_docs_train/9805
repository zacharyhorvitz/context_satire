 Former President Jimmy Carter was released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Wednesday morning after spending more than two weeks there following a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain, according to a statement from the Carter Center. "He and Mrs. Carter look forward to enjoying Thanksgiving at home in Plains, where he will continue to recover," the Carter Center said in a statement. "The Carters are grateful for all the prayers, cards, and notes they have received and hope everyone will join them in enjoying a special Thanksgiving." Carter, 95, was admitted to the hospital on November 11 for the procedure to relieve pressure on his brain.  Former President Jimmy Carter was discharged from a Georgia hospital on Wednesday afternoon, according to the Carter Center. "He said he looks forward to further rest and recovery at home in Plains, Georgia. He and Mrs. Carter wish everyone peace and joy this holiday season," according to a statement from the Carter Center. The 95-year-old Carter was admitted to Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Georgia, last weekend for a urinary tract infection.

"He is feeling better and looks forward to returning home soon. We will issue a statement when he is released for further rest and recovery at home."
