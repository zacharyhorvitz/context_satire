Donald Trump won the general election of Tuesday, November 8, 2016, despite losing the popular vote while winning the electoral college. Media analysts differ as to why the polling industry was unable to correctly forecast the result. Two daily tracking polls, the UPI/CVoter poll and the University of Southern California/Los Angeles Times poll were the only polls that often predicted a Trump popular vote victory or showed a nearly tied election. This is a list of opinion polls taken on the presidency of Donald Trump in 2019. Polls throughout the year have shown that more disapprove of Trump than approve of him, generally by a margin of between five and fifteen percentage points. The polls also show that the margin may be stronger or weaker in some states, when compared with the national polls. A poll conducted on November 11–15, 2019, by NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist Poll of registered American voters showed 45% of respondents favored impeachment and removal from office, while 44% of those polled opposed the idea. A poll on November 16–17, 2019, by ABC News and Ipsos, stated that 51% of those polled believe Trump was wrong in how he handled the Ukrainian situation and should be impeached. Ipsos also said 21% of polled American adults had made up their minds on impeachment due to the hearings, while the others polled said they had made up their mind prior to the hearings.
