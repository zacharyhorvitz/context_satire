RedTube is a pornographic video sharing site, which in September 2009 held an Alexa ranking within the world's top 100 sites. By June 2010 it had fallen out of the top 100, but it made a return in mid-2012. Its popularity has been ascribed to its non-sexual name, which is a reference to the non-pornographic video sharing website YouTube. The website is based in Houston, Texas and has servers in San Francisco, New Orleans and Montreal. Though not the most popular pornographic website, Pornhub holds the honour of being the single largest such website on the internet, hosting more videos than any similar site. The site was launched in Montreal, providing professional and amateur pornography since 2007. Pornhub also has offices and servers in San Francisco, Houston, New Orleans and London. In March 2010, it was bought by Manwin (now known as MindGeek), which owns numerous other pornographic websites. YouPorn is a free pornographic video sharing website and one of the 100 most accessed websites in the world. Since launching in August 2006, it grew to become the most popular pornographic website on the internet, and, in November 2007, it was reported to be the largest free pornographic website as well. As of February 2013, it was the 83rd most popular website overall and the fifth most popular pornographic website. In the category of pornographic websites, it was surpassed in the rankings by competitor sites xHamster, XVideos, and Pornhub, as well as the adult webcam site LiveJasmin.
