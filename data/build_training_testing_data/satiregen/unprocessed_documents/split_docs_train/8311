 There was a sign taped to the front door of Albertine in New York City on Thursday: "Sorry, we won't have any Charlie Hebdo issues today." The message anticipated a question that employees of the French book shop had heard hundreds of times. Stores and newsstands throughout New York that had never sold Charlie Hebdo had been inundated with inquiries from people who have probably never read the satirical magazine. In New York City, at least, "I am Charlie" had become "Where is Charlie?" California is a state in the Pacific Region of the United States. With 39.5 million residents across a total area of about 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2), California is the most populous U.S. state and the third-largest by area. The state capital is Sacramento. The Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second- and fifth-most populous urban regions, with 18.7 million and 9.7 million residents respectively.  Charlie Hebdo's latest issue was released Wednesday to tremendous fanfare and potentially millions of readers. But good luck getting your hands on a copy in the United States. Last week's deadly shooting introduced Charlie Hebdo to scores of people around the world who were previously unfamiliar with the French satirical magazine. As a result, its typical print circulation of 60,000 copies may jump to as many as 3 million for the new issue, which has a cartoon depiction of the Prophet Mohammed on the cover.
