As a child, Kauffman loved reading. When he was 11, Kaufmman had to leave school for a year due to a heart valve that would not close completely. During this year, Kauffman taught himself how to speed read. It was not uncommon for Kauffman to read one-two books a day.  It is the breakthrough signing that has confirmed Paris Saint-Germain's arrival as a potent force in European football as they unveiled Swedish superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic on Tuesday. The striker has been tempted away from Italian giants AC Milan to ply his trade in the French league, signing on a three-year contract for a reputed fee of $24.5 million. Ibrahimovic's capture again underlines the intentions of PSG's owners, Qatar Sports Investment, who have repeatedly stated their intention to transform the club into one of the world's biggest and best. And they have certainly put their money where their mouth is in the transfer market, signing Brazilian defender Thiago Motta as well as Argentina playmakers Ezequiel Lavezzi and Javier Pastore for enormous fees. Ewing Kauffmann was born on September 21, 1916, on a farm near Garden City, Missouri. He was the son of John S. Kauffman and  Effie May Winders who were German-Americans, When Kauffman was a child, his father ended up in a farming accident which left him blind in his right eye. Following the accident, his father relocated the family to Kansas City, where he worked as life insurance salesman.
