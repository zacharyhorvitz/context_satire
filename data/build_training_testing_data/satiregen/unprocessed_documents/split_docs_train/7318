 Republicans on Capitol Hill are not happy with President Donald Trump's plan to raise tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. And chief of staff John Kelly heard about it on Tuesday. Eight Republican lawmakers met with Kelly on Tuesday morning for breakfast at the White House. The meeting was dominated by Trump's decision to impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% on aluminum, sources inside the room said, with multiple senators expressing their concern that the trade decisions would hurt businesses that use those products as well as consumers.  President Donald Trump said Thursday his administration will impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as early as next week, a highly controversial move that Trump framed along economic and national security lines. Trump said the US will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminum to shore up the struggling industries, capping a fierce, months-long internal debate that divided some of the President's top advisers. The move is likely to invite retaliatory measures from foreign countries, raising the specter of a trade war between the US and several other steel-producing countries. It was not immediately clear whether the tariffs would be phased out over time and whether Trump would follow the advice of his national security advisers and exempt some countries from the tariffs to avoid harming key steel-producing US allies.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said it "shouldn't be a surprise to anybody in the whole wide world" that President Donald Trump is putting trade restrictions on steel. "Steel tariffs should not surprise anyone. Go back to the presidential campaign," Ross said Friday night on CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront." Trump announced stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports Thursday, which resulted in widespread criticism from US allies, including Canada and the European Union.
