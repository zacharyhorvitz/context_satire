 A third woman in London has made sexual assault allegations against disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. London Metropolitan Police said they received a report Sunday from a woman alleging an assault took place in 1992 in west London. CNN has been able to verify that the report refers to Weinstein. Before the allegations in London began to emerge, dozens of women in the American entertainment industry had openly accused the film producer of sexual harassment, sexual assault or other sexual misconduct, exposing an extraordinary culture of complicity and intimidation in Hollywood that allowed Weinstein to carry out the alleged actions.  It has taken me a few days to process the sudden explosion of allegations of sexual harassment, abuse and assault made against Harvey Weinstein. Each woman who steps forward leaves me with a mixture of emotions. On the one hand, I feel an overwhelming sense of relief and pride when I see women joining together to share their stories. On the other, I experience a sense of horror over the staggering number of accusers.  The Television Academy could soon become the latest Hollywood organization to distance itself from Harvey Weinstein, in the wake of multiple allegations of sexual harassment and assault brought against the film and television mogul. The Television Academy's Board of Governors met Thursday evening and voted to begin so-called "disciplinary proceedings" against Weinstein that could result in his ouster from the organization. "In accordance with the Academy's established procedures, it was overwhelmingly decided to initiate disciplinary proceedings concerning Academy member Harvey Weinstein; such proceedings could result in action up to and including termination of Academy membership," the statement said. They will have another meeting about the matter in early November.
