The program is under the direction of the Director of Student Activities and the Assistant Director of Student Activities of Northwestern State University. Contestants compete in several categories including interview, evening wear, and swimsuit competition. In addition to being bestowed the title of "Lady of the Bracelet" for the following year, the first place contestant receives a full scholarship and goes on to compete in the Miss Louisiana pageant, which can ultimately result in a berth to the Miss America pageant. It is traditionally held on the first Friday in February. Outside of the NU-Q and Education City communities, freedom of speech is highly limited and anyone who threatened “social values” or Qatar's “general order” through any forms of news, photos, videos or audio recordings can be sentenced to prison. A report by the former President of the Northwestern University Faculty Senate conducted during his tenure as President highlighted that these implicit community values seem to be ingrained in the students, who seemed to willingly comply with these restrictions both intentionally and unintentionally. Concerns have been raised over whether journalism can be taught effectively in a country with limited freedom of expression and where reports of censorship arise from time to time. Additionally, some members of Northwestern's faculty have expressed “dissatisfaction with the academic and free speech protections”. In an interview with the Washington Post, former Northwestern Faculty Senate President, Stephen Eisenman, said that “teaching journalism as an enterprise in which you must first learn what not to ask, is no kind of journalism instruction at all” and continued that at NU-Q this was “likely a matter of encouraging some enquiries and making others strange, awkward, rude or unserious”.
