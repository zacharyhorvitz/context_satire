The highest Australian Powerball jackpot was A$150 million on 19 September 2019. Most jackpot wins are not shared by multiple tickets. There are major differences between the Australian and American versions; in the US, a ticket automatically wins by matching the Powerball (the American game has 26 Powerballs) while in Australia a minimum of three numbers are needed being two regular numbers plus the Powerball. The American jackpot is annuitized (with a cash option) while Australians winners always collect in lump sum. Powerball is a drawing game in which players try to match five numbers from 1 through 69, plus a Powerball number from 1 through 26. A ticket that matches all six numbers wins the jackpot. Jackpot amounts begin at $40 million and grow with each drawing in which the jackpot is not won. Top-prize Powerball winners can choose cash in lieu of annuity payments. Powerball became available in Florida on January 4, 2009; the first drawing including Florida was January 7. Powerball jackpots start at $40 million; it is drawn Wednesday and Saturday nights at 10:59Â p.m. Since October 7, 2015, players choose 5 of 69 "white balls", and a red-colored "Powerball" out of 26 numbers from a separate pool. The odds of winning the jackpot per play are 1 in 292,201,338.
