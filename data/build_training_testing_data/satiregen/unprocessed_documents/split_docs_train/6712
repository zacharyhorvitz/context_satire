Over the years Colorado State University has had a few different mascots. In 1919 there was a black bear cub that served as the mascot not much was known about the cub. It was unknown where the bear came from or even its name, just as he mysteriously appeared, he disappeared the same year. He was replaced by Peanuts the Bulldog in 1912. The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder), colloquially referred to as CU or Colorado, is a public research university in Boulder, Colorado. It is the flagship university of the University of Colorado system and was founded five months before Colorado was admitted to the Union in 1876. By 1892, the last two years of classes were taught in Denver because the larger population afforded more practical experience. This triggered a turf battle with the private medical school at the University of Denver, and the resulting legal battle went all the way to the Supreme Court of Colorado. In 1897, the Supreme Court found that the charter of the University of Colorado restricted it to teaching in Boulder.
