 The first two openly gay US winter Olympians took to social media Friday to tell Vice President Mike Pence what they think of his position on gay rights. "The #OpeningCeremony is a wrap and the 2018 Winter Olympic Gaymes are officially under way!" wrote skier Gus Kenworthy in a caption on an Instagram photo of him and figure skater Adam Rippon. "I feel incredibly honored to be here in Korea competing for the US and I'm so proud to be representing the LGBTQ community alongside this amazing guy!  Vice President Mike Pence on Friday called the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, "every parent's worst nightmare." Speaking at a Republican National Committee event in San Antonio, Pence recounted several stories of victims and heroes from Wednesday's rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 dead. Pence, a father of three, said that "no parent should ever have to fear for their sons and daughters when they kiss them goodbye in the morning." The vice president told the event's attendees that the administration will "continue to bring the full resources of the federal government to bear in support of the Broward County Sheriff's Office and in support of this investigation."  US Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon turned down a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence after criticizing him for his stance on gay rights, USA Today reported Wednesday. After reading a January 17 interview in which Rippon criticized Pence, the vice president's staff asked the US Olympic Committee to set up a conversation that same day between the athlete and the politician, which Rippon ultimately declined, USA Today's Christine Brennan reported, citing two sources with knowledge of the situation. Brennan is also a CNN sports analyst. In a post on his official Twitter account Thursday, Pence told Rippon the US delegation was "for you," and warned him not to let the "fake news" distract him.
