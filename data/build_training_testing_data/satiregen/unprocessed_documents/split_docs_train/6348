 In his native Brazil, Neymar is being counted on to lead the South American nation to World Cup glory on home soil next year. If he can score the kind of goal he did Saturday in the Confederations Cup opener, then Brazil's chances of claiming a record-extending sixth title will surely increase. Neymar, hailed as the "modern successor" to Pele, netted with a stunning half volley in the third minute to help Brazil beat Japan 3-0 in Group A. Paulinho and Jo added the other goals in the second half. "It all happened in a flash," Neymar said. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (abbreviated to UK or U.K.) or Britain, is a sovereign country located off the north­western coast of the European mainland. Existing under its current name since 1921, the United Kingdom includes the island of Great Britain, the north­eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland. Otherwise, the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east, the English Channel to the south and the Celtic Sea to the southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Group of Eight  was an inter-governmental political forum from 1997 until 2014. It had formed from the Group of Seven after excluding the country of Russia, and resumed operating under that name after Russia was disinvited in 2014. The forum originated with a 1975 summit hosted by France that brought together representatives of six governments: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, thus leading to the name Group of Six or G6. The summit came to be known as the Group of Seven, or G7, in 1976 with the addition of Canada.
