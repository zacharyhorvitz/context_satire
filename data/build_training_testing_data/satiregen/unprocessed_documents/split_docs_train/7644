Established in 2007, DINE brings together Applebee's (established in 1980) and IHOP (founded in 1958), celebrating and supporting each brand's individuality, and leveraging their nearly 100 years of hospitality experience and expertise so that guests feel welcome, satisfied and eager to return, every visit, every restaurant, every time. In 1958, Al and Jerry Lapin built their first IHOP restaurant in Los Angeles, California. In November 2007, IHOP purchased Applebee's restaurant chain for approximately $2.1 billion. While other kids at the elite North Point Academy spend countless hours studying, Handsome Davis sees it as nothing more than a system of control over one's mind. That's why Handsome and his three best friends, Sammy, Victor and the cribsheet genius Applebee, have banded together and found ways to cheat on their tests all through their school years. Everything had been going along smoothly until the gang entered their final year of high school and the stakes were upped by the school's principal, Mrs. Stark. If they get caught cheating again Stark will make a note in their permanent records and possibly kill their chances of getting into college. As part of the company's marketing campaign and slogan, Wanda Sykes was hired to voice the chain's new mascot, the Applebee's Apple. The character appears in commercials touting Applebee's various specials and stating the new slogan, "Together is good." or saying, "Get it together, baby!" as the slogan appears at the bottom right of the screen.
