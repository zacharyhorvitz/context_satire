George Washington, the first President of the United States, advocated the establishment of a national university in the U.S. capital in his first State of the Union address in 1790 and continued to promote this idea throughout his career and until his death. In his will, Washington left shares in the Potomac Company to endow the university. However, due to the company's financial difficulties, funds were raised independently. On February 9, 1821, the university was founded by an Act of Congress, making it one of only five universities in the United States with a Congressional charter.  As unrest in Baltimore again focuses attention on race relations in America, President Barack Obama plans to re-launch his My Brother's Keeper Initiative -- meant to address the opportunity deficit for minority youth -- as a non-profit organization. He'll travel to the Bronx on Monday to unveil the "My Brother's Keeper Alliance" at Lehman College, part of the City University of New York System. A job listing found online describes the organization as "in a startup phase" and "preparing for hyper-growth." Obama first announced the My Brother's Keeper program in 2014 as an attempt to reverse trends showing young men of color are more likely to drop out of school, get in trouble with the lawor be unemployed. Beginning with the start of Samuel H. Smithâ€™s term as President in 1985, marked a large period of growth for WSU. In 1989, WSU gained branch campuses in Spokane, the Tri-Cities, and Vancouver with established extension offices and research centers in all regions of the state, with facilities in Prosser and Wenatchee. Smith proved to be a consummate fundraiser, with about $760 million raised during his term, thanks in some part to Microsoft co-founder and alumnus Paul Allen. In the 1990s Smith began to clamp down and take action regarding student alcohol abuse and disciplinary issues after some high-profile incidents on campus in an effort to improve the university's image.
