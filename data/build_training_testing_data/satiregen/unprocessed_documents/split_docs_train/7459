 From Gaza City to Tel Aviv, rockets kept flying, people kept dying and fear and anger on both sides kept growing. For all the bloodshed thus far -- including at least 30 killed in Gaza since Wednesday, according to a Palestinian government website, and Israel reporting three deaths in Kiryat Malachi -- there has been little indication the situation will calm any time soon. In fact, fears are rising that the opposite will hold true. Israel's Cabinet on Friday approved the activation of up to 75,000 reservists, prime minister's spokesman Mark Regev said.  A major conflict is developing in the Middle East this morning. Rockets fired from Gaza to Tel Aviv overnight after Israel began its “Operation Pillar of Defense” on Wednesday when a precision Israeli air strike killed Hamas military mastermind Ahmed Al-Jaabari. Hamas reports at least 15 Palestinians have been killed in missile strikes and Israeli forces reports three of its citizens have been killed. Massive anti-Israeli protests have since sprouted in Jerusalem, the West Bank, Egypt, and Jordan, in reaction in Israel’s strike on the Gaza Strip.  Israeli airstrikes on targets in Gaza continued into the early morning hours of Tuesday, the military said. The air force bombed a weapons storage facility and two sites where rockets had been launched, according to a statement from the Israel Defense Forces. A military representative said militants have launched more than 115 rockets toward Israel since Saturday. "The IDF will not tolerate any attempt to harm Israeli civilians and will operate against anyone who uses terror against the state of Israel," an Israel Defense Forces statement said.
