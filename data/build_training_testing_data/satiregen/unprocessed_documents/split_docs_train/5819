Joseph Harry Fowler Connick Sr. (born March 27, 1926), is an American attorney who served as the district attorney of the Parish of Orleans, which contains the city of New Orleans, from 1973 to 2003. His son, Harry Connick Jr., is a jazz singer, pianist, actor, and humanitarian. Connick Sr. is also a singer, long performing a few nights a week at local clubs as a hobby. The When Harry Met Sally... soundtrack album features American singer and pianist Harry Connick Jr. Bobby Colomby, the drummer for Blood, Sweat & Tears, was a friend of Reiner's and recommended Harry Connick Jr., giving the director a tape of the musician's music. Reiner was struck by Connick's voice and how he sounded like a young Frank Sinatra. The movie's soundtrack album was released by Columbia Records in July 1989. The soundtrack consists of standards performed by Harry Connick Jr. with a big band and orchestra arranged by Marc Shaiman. Connick's musical talents came to the fore when he started learning keyboards at age three, playing publicly at age five, and recording with a local jazz band at ten. When he was nine years old, Connick performed the Piano Concerto No. 3 Opus 37 of Beethoven with the New Orleans Symphony Orchestra (now the Louisiana Philharmonic). Later he played a duet with Eubie Blake at the Royal Orleans Esplanade Lounge in New Orleans.
