On May 3, 2014 an interview with Sulkowicz appeared on the front page of The New York Times. For several days from May 7 onwards, Paul Nungesser's name was included within lists of "sexual assault violators" written on the walls or doors of campus bathrooms, or on flyers. On May 14, Sulkowicz filed a report with the NYPD. Columbia's student newspaper, the Columbia Daily Spectator, controversially published the accused student's name two days later.  Allegations of hazing, racist chanting and sexual assault have become the unattractive face of college fraternities over the past few weeks. From Sigma Chi's chapters at the University of Houston and Westminster College in Missouri, to Sigma Alpha Epsilon's chapters at Furman University in South Carolina and the University of Oklahoma, universities are closing Greek doors and suspending their members at almost record numbers. Allegations of criminal activity and indecent behavior happening within these fraternities, as well as among chapters of Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Delta Rho and Pi Kappa Alpha, have left many questioning whether the Greek system itself is the problem. While it may be unfair to paint fraternities with a broad brush, "We can take note of what they are," said Frank Bruni, author of "Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania." Founded in 1961 under the auspices of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) examines day-to-day press performance as well as the forces that affect that performance. The magazine is published six times a year, and offers a reporting, analysis, criticism, and commentary. CJR.org, its web site, delivers real-time criticism and reporting, giving CJR a presence in the ongoing conversation about the media.
