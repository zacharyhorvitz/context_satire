 Vanquished at the polls in a primary upset, Rep. Eric Cantor said on Wednesday that he would step down as House majority leader, triggering a scramble among conservatives to replace him. Cantor's loss to a college professor and political novice on Tuesday in the Richmond-area campaign energized tea party supporters in a midterm year and obliterated his ambition to lead the House. Critics and analysts said he neglected his base at home in Virginia and paid the price. Cantor called the stunning loss a "personal setback" at a news conference and appealed for party unity before announcing his decision to vacate the No. Eric Ivan Cantor (born June 6, 1963) is a former American politician and lawyer who served as the United States representative for Virginia's 7th congressional district from 2001 until 2014. As a member of the Republican Party, he became House Majority Leader when the 112th Congress convened on January 3, 2011. He previously served as House Minority Whip from 2009 until 2011. His district included most of the northern and western sections of Richmond, along with most of Richmond's western suburbs and, until redistricting in 2013, portions of the Shenandoah Valley. According to the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs, McCarthy is the least-tenured majority leader in the history of the House of Representatives. When he assumed the majority leadership position in July 2014, he had served only seven years, six months and 29 days, the least experience of any floor leader in the House's history by more than a year.
