Shortly after the release of Five Nights at Freddy's, developer Cawthon began to confirm rumors of a sequel to the game. Just one month after the original game's release, Cawthon posted a teaser of a sequel on his webpage, and continued to post teasers until the game's release. A trailer for the game was released in October 2014. Five Nights at Freddy's 2 was first released for Microsoft Windows on November 11, 2014, earlier of its planned release of December 25, 2014. Doors often incorporate locking mechanisms to ensure that only some people can open them. Doors can have devices such as knockers or doorbells by which people outside can announce their presence and summon someone either to open the door for them or give permission to open and enter. Apart from providing access into and out of a space, doors can have the secondary functions of ensuring privacy by preventing unwanted attention from outsiders, of separating areas with different functions, of allowing light to pass into and out of a space, of controlling ventilation or air drafts so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled, of dampening noise, and of blocking the spread of fire. Plans to release the updated A-body lineup was scheduled for the 1972 model year but a strike which occurred at some GM assembly plants delayed the release for a full model year, eventually extending the lifecycle of the 1968-era generation; the redesigned A-bodies were designed in studio where it had more of a European influence - at the time of development John Z. DeLorean was the chairman at the Chevrolet division where he delayed some product releases and extending the lifecycle of some of its products; the redesigned A-bodies had some styling cues lifted from the concurrent second generation F-bodies - the front suspension was integrated into the A-body redesign with output from respective GM divisions (each division had its own sheetmetal design).
