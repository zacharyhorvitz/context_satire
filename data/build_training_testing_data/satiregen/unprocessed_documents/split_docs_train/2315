On November 13, 2015, Trudeau was asked whether his plans to change Canada's contribution to the fight against ISIL and to repeal parts of Bill C-51 would change following the terrorist attacks in Paris. Trudeau responded, "It's too soon to jump to conclusions, but obviously governments have a responsibility to keep their citizens safe, while defending our rights and freedoms, and that balance is something the Canadian government, and indeed all governments around the world, will be focusing on."  On Thursday morning, reports began to circulate that President Donald Trump was leaning toward voiding the North American Free Trade Agreement. By Thursday afternoon, Trump had changed his mind  -- the US would stay in NAFTA. What changed? He talked to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto.  Do politicians need to be populist to be popular? Since the election of President Trump and the Brexit result in the UK, this has been the question haunting European politics. With the first round victory of Emmanuel Macron in the French Presidential elections, it seems we have an answer. There is a route for centrist politicians to be popular while staying true to themselves.
