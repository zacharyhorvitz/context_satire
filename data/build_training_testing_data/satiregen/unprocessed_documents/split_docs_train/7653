Decker's Truck series debut at Daytona saw her No. 54 Toyota cut a left front tire and rupture an oil line, setting the truck on fire on the first lap. At Kentucky Speedway in July, Decker was involved in an on-track incident with Spencer Boyd, eliminating both drivers from the race. Later, in the truck garage, Decker took Boyd’s hat off his head and slammed it on the ground before being verbally warned by a NASCAR official stating "that's enough". On August 7, 2019, it was announced that Boyd was set to make his Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series career debut in that weekend’s race at Michigan International Speedway. The ride would come in the No. 53 for Rick Ware Racing, a team Boyd has previously driven for in the Xfinity and Truck Series. Boyd was born in Glasgow, Scotland to William and Mary Boyd, who both died a year apart when Boyd was in his early teens. He worked as a bookbinder for six years before pursuing an acting career. After graduating from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, he went on to perform with St Andrews Repertory and the Traverse Theatre.
