Confused, Anna leaves David behind, encountering Peter again. Peter points out that the commune has been razed, and he insists on starting a new one with Anna as his wife. When she refuses, he attempts to rape her. She kills him, and he forgives her with his last words. The idea to musicalize Ah, Wilderness came to David Merrick when George M. Cohan came through St. Louis with the original production of the O'Neill play. (It was rare of Merrick to mention his hometown, as he hated it, and once he refused to fly TWA to the coast because it flew over St. Louis). While producing The Matchmaker in 1955, he began working on Connecticut Summer. Things came to a halt when lyricist/librettist John La Touche died suddenly. Coming to take charge of the work in the spring of 1907 when the prospects were none too bright, he has developed and trained teams for the last three years that are a credit to him and to the school, and through them his hard work and excellent coaching is clearly shown. In his coaching and training he has not only given especial attention to each individual and to keeping the entire team in the best possible condition, but also has always insisted on team work so that his teams have all worked together like well lubricated machines. Too much cannot be said of Reid's ability as a coach and trainer of athletes.
