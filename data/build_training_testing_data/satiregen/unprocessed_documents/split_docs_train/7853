As the organization worked to define its mission, two charges surfaced from it – resolutions, and from the program – budget decisions. These changes were (1) to be the national voice for rural education, and (2) to sponsor the research that would provide validity to that “voice.” So important was the concept of being a national voice, the organization once again changed its name in 1986 to the National Rural Education Association. Some members felt that the dues issue would be the end of the organization because people would not be willing to pay $50 to belong to REA. Others were upset because affiliation with AASA had been rejected. After 1980 the organization was different. Some members chose not to renew their membership. In 1968 the Association became the Rural Education Association, and in the following year CUIS elected its last president. It appears that the two groups that had been meeting together apparently merged their meeting dates, their leaders, and their goals. The growth of the adversary relationship between teachers’ organizations and administrators must have resulted in an uncomfortable relationship between the Rural Education Association and its sponsoring organization, the National Rural Education Association. The rural department had expanded over the years to include county and intermediate superintendents and the leadership of the organization most often was from the ranks of administrators or representatives of higher education.
