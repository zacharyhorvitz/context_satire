 A 5-year-old boy freed Monday after being held captive in an underground bunker for six days is laughing and smiling and playing with his favorite toy dinosaur after being reunited with his family, authorities said. The boy's kidnapper is dead, but officials offered no details on the raid that freed the boy -- identified only by his first name, Ethan -- and left his abductor fatally shot. FBI Special Agent in Charge Steve Richardson visited Ethan at a hospital, where he was in a private area with heavy security. "He is doing fine," Richardson told reporters at a late-night news conference.  The hostage standoff in Alabama came to an end yesterday when FBI officials say negotiations broke down with 65-year-old Jimmy Lee Dykes, the abductor of a five-year-old boy taken off a school bus last Tuesday. Dykes is now dead. The FBI rescued that five-year-old hostage named "Ethan" from an underground bunker in Midland City, Alabama. Ethan returns home just in time to celebrate his sixth birthday tomorrow.  Jimmy Lee Dykes told neighbors he was building a storm shelter. He told one neighbor tornadoes had come dangerously close to destroying his homes in the past. But that bunker 4 feet below the Alabama dirt became a prison for one young boy named Ethan, surely more terrifying than any storm. He was held there for six days after being stolen from his school bus by Dykes who killed the driver after demanding hostages.
