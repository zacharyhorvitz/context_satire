 It was supposed to be the boring convention -- but the Democrats suddenly found that their Philadelphia party had turned into a Cold War-style espionage thriller. Democrats expected to show up in Philadelphia to nominate Hillary Clinton, paper over their disunity and turn their fire directly on Republican nominee Donald Trump and the foreboding picture he painted of America at the GOP convention. Instead, they were greeted by explosive fallout from a suspected Russian hack on the Democratic National Committee that exposed emails -- published by Wikileaks -- of top officials scheming against Bernie Sanders. The storm felled the party's leader, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was booed by members of her own Florida delegation Monday morning in the wake of the email disclosure and ultimately shelved plans to brave the convention hall Monday night.  It is official. He's with Her. On Monday night, Bernie Sanders finally did what all runners-up for a presidential nomination are tasked with doing. It is not easy and it certainly is humbling (ask Hillary Clinton, circa 2008).  Bernie Sanders sought to show a united front at the Democratic National Convention Tuesday by asking delegates to accept Hillary Clinton's nomination unanimously and by acclimation. The plan came at the end of the roll call vote of all 50 states. "I move that Hillary Clinton be selected as the nominee of the Democratic party for President of the United States," Sanders told the convention. The move came as Sanders has attempted to tamp down his rowdy supporters, at times getting booed by his own backers as he called for Democratic unity.
