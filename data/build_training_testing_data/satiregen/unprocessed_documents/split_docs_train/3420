At the height of the Vietnam War in 1967, American poet Richard Wilbur composed A Miltonic Sonnet for Mr. Johnson on His Refusal of Peter Hurd's Official Portrait. In a clear cut case of "criticism from the Right", Wilbur compares U.S. President Lyndon Baines Johnson with Thomas Jefferson and finds the former to be greatly wanting. Commenting that Jefferson "would have wept to see small nations dread/ The imposition of our cattle brand," and that in Jefferson's term, "no army's blood was shed", Wilbur urges President Johnson to seriously consider how history will judge him and his Administration. In the late 1960s, John was engaged to be married to his first lover, secretary Linda Woodrow, who is mentioned in the song "Someone Saved My Life Tonight". In 1970, right after his first US shows in Los Angeles, he lost his virginity to and started his first gay relationship with John Reid, the Tamla Motown label manager for the UK, who later became John's manager until 1998. The relationship ended five years later. He married German recording engineer Renate Blauel on 14 February 1984, in Darling Point, Sydney, with speculation that the marriage was a cover for his homosexuality. As time approaches at 2:22, Dylan rushes to the Grand Central Terminal to find Jonas with Sarah there. Angry, Jonas aims his gun at Dylan, and then to Sarah, and at 2:21 pm, Jonas fires his shot, but Dylan took a hit instead to protect her, and at 2:22, Jonas is shot and killed by the police. As Dylan momentarily passes out in Sarah's arms, she looked at the clock, and learned that they finally survived the whole event, with the time pointing at 2:23pm. In the final scenes, Dylan Branson (who has survived being shot), and his wife, Sarah, lived together with a baby, and for Branson, he finally overcame his fear of flying, and is now a pilot.
