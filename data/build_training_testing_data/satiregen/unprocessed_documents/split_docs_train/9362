Phil Leotardo, played by actor Frank Vincent, is a high-ranking member of the Lupertazzi crime family and the primary antagonist of the final two seasons of the show. Originally a captain, following the death of the original boss, Carmine Lupertazzi, the imprisonment and death of his successor Johnny Sacrimoni, and a brief power struggle with would-be boss Faustino "Doc" Santoro, Phil becomes the boss of the family. His inability to forgive the death of his brother at the hands of Tony's cousin, Tony Blundetto—even after Blundetto's own murder—forms one of the central conflicts of the series, with Leotardo aiming to kill Tony and cripple his entire organization in revenge. Leotardo had an alleged 27 hits to his credit. Prost's disqualification promoted de Angelis to the win, his second in F1, with second place awarded to Boutsen - who ran out of fuel as he reached the start-finish straight on his final lap and pushed his Arrows across the finish line - and third to Frenchman Patrick Tambay who also ran out of fuel just before the finish line and pushed his Renault across the line to secure his finishing position, in what would turn out to be the last podium finish for both Tambay and the original factory Renault team. Prost was leading by half a minute when on lap 49, five from the end, his Renault suffered a mechanical failure. This left de Angelis and Rosberg – neither of whom had won a Grand Prix before – battling for the lead. At the start of the last lap de Angelis was 1.6 seconds ahead. Rosberg closed rapidly on the final tour and was right on the Lotus's gearbox heading into the final corner, the Rindt Kurve.
