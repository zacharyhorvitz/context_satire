Although the official origin of the everything bagel is disputed, David Gussin is typically credited for its invention sometime around 1980. Gussin allegedly developed the idea for the everything bagel one day while sweeping up leftover bagel toppings from the oven. Instead of disposing of the leftover toppings, Gussin claims to have saved them in a bin and convinced the store owner to make bagels with them. Gussin recognizes the possibility that others could have invented the famous bagel topping combination before him, however he is adamant that he was the first to coin the name "everything bagel". In 1990, while still playing for the Dolphins, Offerdahl opened a bagel store, Offerdahl's Bagel Gourmet, in Weston, Florida. It would become the first of 10 locations. In 1995, Offerdahl merged with three other bagel retailers to form Einstein Bros. Bagels, a national chain. He stayed with the company for just over a year as the Vice President of Operations for Florida, and was a member of the board until 1997. Though the original bagel has a fairly well-defined recipe and method of production, there is no legal standard of identity for bagels in the United States. Bakers are free to call any bread torus a bagel, even those that deviate wildly from the original formulation.
