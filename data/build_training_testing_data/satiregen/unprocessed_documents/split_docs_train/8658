Ashley Parker Angel was born Ashley Ward Parker, the child of Darren and Paula Parker, and raised in the town of Redding, California. His grandparents are of German and Irish descent. Ashley was named after the fictional character Ashley Wilkes, his mother's favorite character from Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel Gone with the Wind, and the classic film of the same title. When Ashley was three years old, his parents divorced. Back in January 2011, rumors were swirling that a reunion was in the works for the band. TMZ reported that Erik, Trevor, Dan & Jacob have returned to the studio to record the follow-up to O2, however, it was confirmed that Ashley Parker Angel declined the offer from the guys. Ashley told TMZ in a following article his explanation. "O-Town was one of the greatest chapters of my life, so when the idea of a reunion was brought to me, of course I was intrigued. A series of scenes over the end credits reveal the truth behind the crime. It turns out that Ted Wheetly's shy, nebbish lawyer, George, was in fact the mastermind behind the whole scheme. George is actually a career con artist who, for many years, impersonated a lawyer who plotted to steal all of the Wheetly family's money, totaling $155 million. George first approached Brandi (who held a grudge against the Wheetly family) to help him, and Brandi then approached Rachel.
