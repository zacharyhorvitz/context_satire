Jordan was the assistant wrestling coach with the Ohio State University's (OSU) wrestling program from 1987 to 1995. Ohio State University began an independent investigation in AprilÂ 2018 into allegations of sexual misconduct by the former wrestling team's physician, Richard Strauss; Strauss was the team physician during Jordan's tenure as assistant coach. Strauss committed suicide in 2005. In early June 2018, at least eight former wrestlers said that Jordan had been aware of, but did not respond to, allegations of sexual misconduct by Strauss. Once the money was in hand, eight years of Congressional haggling ensued over how to interpret Smithson's rather vague mandate "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge". Unfortunately, the money was invested by the US Treasury in bonds issued by the state of Arkansas, which soon defaulted. After heated debate, Massachusetts representative (and former president) John Quincy Adams persuaded Congress to restore the lost funds with interest and, despite designs on the money for other purposes, convinced his colleagues to preserve it for an institution of science and learning. Finally, on August 10, 1846, President James K. Polk signed the legislation that established the Smithsonian Institution as a trust instrumentality of the United States, to be administered by a Board of Regents and a secretary of the Smithsonian. In July 2018, Jordan's congressional office released a statement prepared by public relations firm in which Hellickson reportedly said "At no time while Jim Jordan was a coach with me at Ohio State did either of us ignore abuse of our wrestlers. This is not the kind of man Jim is, and it is not the kind of coach that I was."
