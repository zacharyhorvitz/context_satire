He was a wonderful man, a fabulous actor and a dear and close friend since the first day we worked together. As Alan  said, he did not have an unadorable bone in his body. He was a treasure as a person, an imp at times, and always a true professional. He had worked with the greats and never saw himself as one of them. Charles trained as an actress and dancer at the Gemini Drama School and started her career in British television commercials, having been chosen as the face to launch Coca-Cola's new flagship brand Sprite. She continues in commercials and modelling work to this day but it was not until moving to Australia in the mid 1990s with then boyfriend, Scott Michaelson, that she landed her first acting role. Having turned up at Grundy Television studios auditioning for game show The Price is Right, Charles was noticed by casting director Jan Russ and invited to read for a part on Neighbours. She played Sarah Beaumont a role that was written for her off and on from 1995 to 2016. A three-quarter length oil portrait of Thomas Michaelson, in the dress uniform of a cavalry officer, can be seen on the website of the Dock Museum Collection.
