In the early hours of August 29, 1903, bank robbers broke into the Brewer Savings Bank using dynamite. They took $300 from the vault (most of the money having been removed beforehand) and retreated across the bridge to Bangor firing their guns at people in Brewer and police on the Bangor side. Despite mobilizing the entire Bangor police force in pursuit, they escaped capture. Mendocino Lodge No. 179, Free & Accepted Masons of California, continues to hold its meetings on the second floor of the building while much of the first floor now serves as the local branch of the Savings Bank of Mendocino County, to whom the building was sold in 1977. All four of these buildings were built beginning in 1865, after a fire devastated Augusta's downtown. This building was designed by Francis H. Fassett, Maine's preeminent architect of the time, and was built for O.C. Whitehouse, a dry goods merchant. He operated his store out of the building's second floor, while the first floor had as early tenants the Augusta Savings Bank and the United States Pension Agency.
