 Ted Cruz bowed out of the Republican presidential race Tuesday following a crushing loss to Donald Trump in Indiana, clearing the path for the real estate mogul to clinch the GOP nomination. It was a remarkable turn of events in a presidential primary race that seemed destined -- just weeks ago -- to end in a contested convention this summer. Even in the final hours of the race in the Hoosier State, Cruz insisted he was staying in the race until June 7 -- going so far as to attack his rival during a news conference as a "pathological liar" unfit for the White House. In the end, the growing strength of Trump's candidacy and Cruz's own stumbles in the past two weeks were too much for Cruz to overcome.  Even by the standards of the 2016 presidential campaign, Ted Cruz has had a dramatic week. Unusual tactical campaign moves, unforced errors on the trail and sweeping losses in the most recent round of GOP presidential primaries were the low points. Then, he won the endorsement of Indiana's governor, just days before the critical Hoosier State primary. Here are some moments from Cruz's week that was: Tag team with Kasich?  Donald Trump is predicting he can knock rival Ted Cruz out of the Republican presidential race by winning Tuesday's primary here, and recent polling shows he's in good shape. Both Trump and Cruz are hitting the campaign trail hard in Indiana, making appearances Sunday and several more planned for Monday. Trump will hold two rallies the day ahead of the primary, in Carmel and South Bend. Cruz is holding five events, with Indiana Gov.
