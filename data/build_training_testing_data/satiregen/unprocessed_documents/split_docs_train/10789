 Justice Antonin Scalia's death immediately triggered a monumental election-year battle in Washington over whether President Barack Obama should choose a successor who could tilt the Supreme Court toward liberals. Within two hours of Scalia's death being reported, presidential candidates along with Republican and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill were feuding over whether Obama should appoint a replacement for the eloquent and outspoken Scalia or wait for the next administration to make a decision. The battle lines underscored the huge political stakes in the 2016 election, which could cement the ideological balance of the court for years to come. Obama said Saturday he would nominate a successor "in due time," but Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insisted the next administration should make the appointment.  Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said the next president should choose the Supreme Court Justice to replace Antonin Scalia, days after stating whomever President Barack Obama picks should get a hearing in the Senate. "I urge Pres. Obama to follow a tradition embraced by both parties and allow his successor to select the next Supreme Court justice," the Alaska Republican tweeted Thursday evening. "If POTUS ignores precedent, I believe extraordinary circumstances give the Senate every right to deny the nominee an up or down vote.  Sen. Chuck Grassley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee which considers Supreme Court appointments, says he has not decided whether to give a confirmation hearing to President Barack Obama's eventual nominee to replace the recently deceased Justice Antonin Scalia. The Iowa Republican told home-state reporters he'd wait for Obama's nominee to be named before announcing his decision. "I would wait until the nominee is made before I would make any decisions," Grassley said Tuesday morning. "In other words, take it a step at a time."
