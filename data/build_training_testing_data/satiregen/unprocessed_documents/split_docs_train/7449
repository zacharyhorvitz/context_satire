 Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday praised President Donald Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey and insisted the decision wasn't due to the ongoing probe into alleged ties between Trump's campaign and Russia. "As has been stated repeatedly and the President has been told, he's not under investigation," Pence told reporters on Capitol Hill. He added: "There is no evidence of collusion between our campaign and any Russian officials." America's new post-Comey reality The vice president is taking the lead on the Hill in hopes of helping to reshape the narrative surrounding Comey's exit, a White House official said.  Democratic Rep. Al Green said Tuesday evening that President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey would be an impeachable offense if it was done to stop the investigation into alleged ties between Russian and Trump's 2016 campaign. Trump fired Comey Tuesday, citing a letter from the deputy attorney general that criticized the FBI director's handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server. However, the timing of Comey's firing -- in the midst of an FBI investigation into Trump's associates and Russia -- has raised serious questions about the President's motives. "Well, we live in a world where it's not enough for things to be right.  There are two reasons why President Donald Trump fired James Comey, according to a source close to the now-former FBI director: Comey never provided the President with any assurance of personal loyalty. The fact that the FBI's investigation into possible Trump team collusion with Russia in the 2016 election was accelerating. The official White House version of what happened is that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, fresh on the job, wrote a memo expressing concern about the way Comey had handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But mounting evidence suggests Comey was actually fired because of the Russian investigation.
