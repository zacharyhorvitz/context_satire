In 1989 at a consumer electronics show in Baltimore, where his company had a trade stand, he met John Fitzgerald Byers and Richard Langly and they subsequently formed a group publishing The Lone Gunmen newsletter. Frohike has a deep attraction for Dana Scully. In his first appearance he was taking photographs of Scully, ogling her and calling her “hot”. Whilst this attraction seemed rather lustful at first, he has shown genuine affection for Scully (and Fox Mulder) on numerous occasions, being the first person to bring her flowers after she returned from her abduction in the episode "One Breath". In 2000, Scully found Gibson living in Arizona in a school for the deaf, where he was apparently in hiding from alien bounty hunters or a New Syndicate like organization, who wanted him because he was "part alien". At the end of the episode, John Doggett said Gibson had become a ward of the state, and had been put under special protection. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club called the film a "cross between Wet Hot  and A Midsummer Night's Dream" and deemed it "a worthy followup to  Heathers."
