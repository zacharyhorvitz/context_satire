Former IPCC chairman Robert Watson said, regarding the Himalayan glaciers estimation, "The mistakes all appear to have gone in the direction of making it seem like climate change is more serious by overstating the impact. That is worrying. The IPCC needs to look at this trend in the errors and ask why it happened". Martin Parry, a climate expert who had been co-chair of the IPCC working group II, said that "What began with a single unfortunate error over Himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance" and the IPCC had investigated the other alleged mistakes, which were "generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment". A group of scientists launched a project named the "Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists" that contains the "Doomsday Clock" after the bombardment of Hiroshima and Nagasaky. The biggest is the danger to humanity the clock moves closer to midnight and vice versa. The target is to show the extent of danger to humanity, create awareness in public that will lead to solutions. In the beginning the organization focused on the danger of nuclear war, but in the 21th century, it has begun to deal with other issues like climate change and disinformation on the internet. The NIPCC presents itself as an "international panel of nongovernment scientists and scholars who have come together to present a comprehensive, authoritative, and realistic assessment of the science and economics of global warming". Because it is not a government agency, and because its members are predisposed to dispute that climate change is caused by human greenhouse gas emissions, NIPCC claims to offer an independent “second opinion” of the evidence reviewed – or not reviewed – by the  IPCC. The scientific validity of the claims made by the NIPCC report have been heavily criticized, as has the methodology of their reports and the lack of expertise of many of their authors.
