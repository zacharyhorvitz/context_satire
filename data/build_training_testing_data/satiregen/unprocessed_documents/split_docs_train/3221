 The US Constitution states plainly that "the Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments." You don't need a law degree to understand that a trial is the search for the truth. And to achieve that, you need to hear from witnesses with relevant information. Even "Judge Judy" has witnesses on her show.  More than three weeks after President Donald Trump was impeached by the House, his impeachment trial has not begun in Senate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democratic colleagues on Friday to prepare to transmit the two House articles of impeachment within the coming week. These are the articles the House voted on in December for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, after an investigation into Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democrats before the 2020 election, following a whistleblower report filed in August. Here is the final report on what Democrats found.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter to her caucus on Friday that she's preparing to send the impeachment articles to the Senate next week to start the impeachment trial of Presidnet Donald Trump. Read the letter below:  Dear Democratic Colleague,   For weeks now, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has been engaged in tactics of delay in presenting transparency, disregard for the American people's interest for a fair trial and dismissal of the facts. Yesterday, he showed his true colors and made his intentions to stonewall a fair trial even clearer by signing on to a resolution that would dismiss the charges. A dismissal is a cover-up and deprives the American people of the truth.
