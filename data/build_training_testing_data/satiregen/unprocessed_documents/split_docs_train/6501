 With one week until the 2018 midterms, will voters hold candidates who ignore protecting public health and the planet accountable? They certainly should since the risks could not be greater. Several weeks ago, an alarming report issued by 91 scientists who comprise the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees F.) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030. This brings an increased risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.  A Native American tribe is suing to stop North Dakota's new voter identification law before the midterm election vote next week, saying that the law disenfranchises voters living on reservations. The complaint centers around a state voter ID law that requires voters to provide a form of identification that includes their legal name, current street address and date of birth. The plaintiffs say the street address requirement poses a unique challenge to Native Americans who live on reservations or in rural areas, as the street names and residential addressees there have been assigned in incomplete or inconsistent ways. The federally-recognized Spirit Lake Tribe filed a complaint Tuesday against North Dakota Secretary of State Alvin Jaeger that reads: "Jaeger's implementation of the residential address requirement has imposed severe—sometimes insurmountable—burdens on the right to vote for many voters on reservations." Gerry P. Scharfenberger, who had served on the Middletown Township Committee for 14 years, was sworn into office in February 2018 to fill the seat expiring in December 2019 that had been held by Serena DiMaso until she resigned after taking office in the New Jersey General Assembly; Scharfenberger will serve on an interim basis until the November 2018 general election, when voters will select a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.
