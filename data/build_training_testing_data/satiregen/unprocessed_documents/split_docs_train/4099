The main task of Profolk is to create better conditions for folk and world music. This genre is represented and supported in Germany through constant exchange with political and business entities and the German Music Council. The association also supports the organization and implementation of concerts, workshops and similar activities. In addition, Profolk aims to promote musical, cultural and human diversity. Profolk was founded on 25 November 1984 in Göttingen. Since then, the main objective of the association has been to represent the interests of folk and world music in politics, business and society. Profolk,  a member of the German Music Council, is the only national non-profit association in Germany for this genre. The association operates worldwide. Since 1991, the annual Tanz & Folkfest Rudolstadt, also called Rudolstadt-Festival, takes place at the initiative of Profolk e.V. The beginnings of the Rudolstadt Festival date back to 1955, when the "1st Festival of German Folk Dance" was held in Rudolstadt, which developed into the German Democratic Republic (East German) dance and folklore festival with strong Eastern European participation. In 1991 it was relaunched with a completely different concept: initially conceived as a forum for the classical folk scene, the event soon established itself as a world music festival of international renown. The German Folk Promotion Prize (Deutscher Folk Förderpreis, DFF) was awarded at this festival between 1992 and 2001.
