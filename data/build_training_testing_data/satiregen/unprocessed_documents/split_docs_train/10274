While on a mission to 2002 to have George W. Bush forget about building the world's biggest ball of twine, Otto is taken back to the orphanage from which he came (as seen in the first episode) by Sister Thornley when Larry and Tuddrussel forget him. Without Otto, Larry and Tuddrussel must once again try to complete a historical mission (this time centered on Christopher Columbus who is working as a hot dog vendor instead of discovering America) on their own. When that fails, they scour many orphans from the past to find a replacement boy genius. When they realize that no one could replace Otto, Larry and Tuddrussel go back to the orphanage to rescue him from Sister Thornley. Under McManus and Warden Leo Glynn, all inmates in "Em City" struggle to fulfill their own needs. Some fight for power – either over the drug trade or over other inmate factions and individuals. Others, corrections officers and inmates alike, simply want to survive, some long enough to make parole and others just to see the next day. The show's narrator, inmate Augustus Hill, explains the show, and provides context, thematic analysis, and a sense of humor. After Otto catches a cold from not wearing a coat during the Time Squad's mission to Russia to get Karl Marx to write the Communist Manifesto instead of building the world's largest igloo, Tuddrussel and Larry must complete a historical mission without Otto helping them by trying to get Benjamin Franklin to be an author of the Declaration of Independence. Tuddrussel and Larry revealed to be highly incompetent on their mission. The first part had Tuddrussel beating up John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Rush because he thought they were Franklin. Then Tuddrussel and Larry thought that Franklin invented the lightbulb where Otto corrected them by stating it was Thomas Edison who invented the lightbulb.
