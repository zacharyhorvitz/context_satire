 The New York Times published a 4,536-word opus on President Donald Trump's two-year-long (and running!) attempt to thwart the multiple investigations into his 2016 presidential campaign and its ties to Russia. The entire thing is worth reading. It's chock-a-block with news -- like that Trump reportedly asked acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to install an ally to oversee the Southern District of New York investigation into Michael Cohen!!  Marc Short is returning to the Trump administration with a new title: chief of staff for Vice President Mike Pence. Short, who previously served as the President Donald Trump's White House legislative affairs director before stepping down last summer, will replace Nick Ayers. Ayers left at the end of last year after he declined an offer to become Trump's chief of staff because the two could not agree to a time commitment. Short, who worked for Pence during the 2016 campaign, will have an office in the West Wing.  President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, denied on Wednesday that he wanted a job at the White House after Trump was elected in 2016. "I was extremely proud to be the personal attorney for the President of the United States of America. I did not want to go to the White House. I was offered jobs," Cohen claimed.
