The firm announced that, effective 1 January 2017, Fred Nance would become Global Managing Partner of Squire Patton Boggs, U.S. LLP, managing 955 attorneys in 36 offices in 16 countries, including U.S., Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. This incorporates 688 lawyers in the US and the Dominican Republic. Nance has also been named to the firmâ€™s six member executive committee, where he will be the first African-American partner. Nance has had a storied career with Squires, negotiating a pact between the NFL and the city of Cleveland to return the Browns to the city; becoming a finalist for the position of NFL Commissioner in 2005; saving 1,000 and securing 600 more Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS) jobs for the city, when the Pentagon said it could no longer afford them; and signing up a young high school basketball player, LeBron James, as a client in 2002. Boggs, a Democrat, began his legal practice in New Orleans and later moved to Washington, D.C., to become a lawyer and lobbyist. He joined the law/lobbyist firm of James R. Patton Jr., which today is known as Squire Patton Boggs. Boggs was the firm's senior partner. With Patton Boggs, he was known for lobbying on major issues, including: Prominent Founding Fathers writing in The Federalist Papers felt that elections were essential to liberty, that a bond between the people and the representatives was particularly essential, and that "frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured". In 2009, however, few Americans were familiar with leaders of Congress. The percentage of Americans eligible to vote who did, in fact, vote was 63% in 1960, but has been falling since, although there was a slight upward trend in the 2008 election. Public opinion polls asking people if they approve of the job Congress is doing have, in the last few decades, hovered around 25% with some variation.
