The Fat free lean index is one of several measures of hog quality (in this case, leanness) that can be used in determining value. The index was developed by the National Pork Producers Council, an industry trade group. The National Pork Producers Council is a trade association representing U.S. pork producers and other industry stakeholders. It  conducts public policy outreach on behalf of its affiliated state associations from its headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa. The NPPC's supports the industry's standard practice of housing pregnant pigs in gestation crates, which has been criticized by The Humane Society and other animal welfare groups. Use of the slogan "The Other White Meat" ended in 2011. The board continued to pay $3 million per year to the National Pork Producers Council.
