 In one of Jeffrey Epstein's last interviews, he told a reporter for The New York Times that he had dirt on a number of famous people and that criminalizing sex with teenagers was a "cultural aberration." The interview with James B. Stewart, a Times columnist, staff writer at The New Yorker and acclaimed author, came a year ago at Epstein's mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. "The overriding impression I took away from our roughly 90-minute conversation was that Mr. Epstein knew an astonishing number of rich, famous and powerful people, and had photos to prove it," Stewart wrote in the Times on Monday. "He also claimed to know a great deal about these people, some of it potentially damaging or embarrassing, including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use."  Jeffrey Epstein signed a last will and testament two days before his death, the 11-page document shows. The will is dated August 8, two days before Epstein was found dead by suicide in a federal jail in New York. The record and Epstein's death certificate were filed Monday with a court in the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein had a home. Epstein, 66, appointed two executors to his estate, Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn.  Jeffrey Epstein's death was an abrupt end to a life marked by wealth, power and years of sex crime allegations. But the multimillionaire's apparent suicide in a New York federal jail has spurred questions and myths about his death and the future of legal cases against him. Here's what we know about Epstein's final days, and what will happen now. Why was he recently in jail?
