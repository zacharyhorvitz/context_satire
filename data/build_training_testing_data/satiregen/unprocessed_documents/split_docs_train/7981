The United States began to place a greater focus on math and science education during the "Space Race" that began in the 1950s. The launch of Sputnik in 1957 by the Soviet Union created a scare that the United States was not a leader in math and science. In response to Sputnik, the National Defense Education Act initiated education policy that aimed to increase college enrollment and prepare a workforce qualified to compete with the Soviet Union in science and technical fields. (http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/role.html)Math and science education continued to receive attention following the Cold War through various programs and policy in the STEM fields. Although women make up 47% of the workforce  in the U.S., they hold only 24% of STEM jobs. Research suggests that exposing girls to female inventors at a young age has the potential to reduce the gender gap in technical STEM fields by half . Campaigns from organizations like the National Inventors Hall of Fame aimed to achieve a 50/50 gender balance in their youth STEM programs by 2020. In the United States, the National Science Foundation found that the average science score on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress was lower for black and Hispanic students than white, Asian, and Pacific Islanders. In 2011, eleven percent of the U.S. workforce was black, while only six percent of STEM workers were black. Though STEM in the U.S. has typically been dominated by white males, there have been considerable efforts to create initiatives to make STEM a more racially and gender diverse field. Some evidence suggests that all students, including black and Hispanic students, have a better chance of earning a STEM degree if they attend a college or university at which their entering academic credentials are at least as high as the average student's.
