During early conversations about the 2015 film Jurassic World, executive producer Steven Spielberg told director Colin Trevorrow that he was interested in having several more films made. In April 2014, Trevorrow announced that sequels had been discussed: "We wanted to create something that would be a little bit less arbitrary and episodic, and something that could potentially arc into a series that would feel like a complete story." Trevorrow said Chris Pratt and Omar Sy might reprise their roles for the next few films and that he would direct the film if asked. Trevorrow later told Spielberg he would only focus on directing one film in the Jurassic Park series, and announced in May 2015 that he would be involved in the sequel "in some way, but not as director." In his initial film treatment, Trevorrow had included story elements that Marshall and Crowley considered excessive for a single film. The producers felt it was important to include details about Owen and Claire's lives after the events of Jurassic World. Although the original ending was the same as the final film, Trevorrow had wanted to include more details about the integration of dinosaurs into the world. He chose to remove them to keep the story focused. On July 23, 2015, Universal announced that a sequel, referred to as Jurassic World 2, had been scheduled for a June 22, 2018, release date in the U.S. It was also announced that Trevorrow would write the script with his writing partner Derek Connolly, as they had for Jurassic World; that the film would be produced by Frank Marshall; and that Spielberg and Trevorrow would act as executive producers, while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard would reprise their roles from the previous film. At the time of the film's announcement, Trevorrow said the series "isn't always going to be limited to theme parks". He confirmed the film would not involve "a bunch of dinosaurs chasing people on an island" stating, "That'll get old real fast."
