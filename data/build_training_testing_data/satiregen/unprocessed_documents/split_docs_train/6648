Dating back, not a few years ago, in the late 1990s there was a dreadful rebellion by most of the Kosovars. Most of these Kosovars were Muslim came out with an open rebellion against the Serbian rule. The “ethnic cleansing” that the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, enforced towards the population not just of Pristina but the whole of Kosovo, killed thousands and hundreds had to flee. Between March and June 1999, NATO intervened with a 78-day campaign focused at bombing and of which was done to tackle Serb forces and so Kosovo remains under UN control. The university of Pristina was founded in the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo, Socialist Republic of Serbia, Yugoslavia, in Pristina, the first academic year being 1969-1970, and functioning until 1999. However, because of political upheaval, war, consecutive expulsion of faculty of one ethnicity or the other, extensive differences between the ethnicities, it separated into two disjoint institutions using the same name, albeit simply to reflect ethnic identity. Albanian-language activity continues to this day in Pristina, whilst the Serbian one, Univezitet u Prištini, has been located in Northern Mitrovica, where it still maintains its place in the Serbian Education System. The road coming into Podujevo from the city of Niš was the site of the 2001 Podujevo bus bombing, in which a bus carrying Serb pilgrims traveling to the Gračanica monastery site was bombed. Twelve Serb pilgrims were killed and dozens more were injured by the bomb-blast. Kosovo Albanian extremists have been blamed for the attack.
