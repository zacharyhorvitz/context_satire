The resurrected Jesus is said to have ascended to Heaven where he now sits at the Right Hand of God and will return to Earth in the Second Coming. Various people have been said to have entered Heaven while still alive, including Enoch, Elijah and Jesus himself, after his resurrection. According to Roman Catholic teaching, Mary, mother of Jesus, is also said to have been assumed into Heaven and is titled the Queen of Heaven. He claims to know the Lord, who is beyond measure and beyond thought; By mere words, he plans to enter heaven. I do not know where heaven is. Everyone claims that he plans to go there. By mere talk, the mind is not appeased. In contrast to the Thirteen Heavens, there are also Nine Hells associated with Ancient Aztec mythology. Each level of the Nine Hells were said to be worse than the last, until reaching the final level where they faced Tezcatlipoca, God of death, who would then remove his mask of jade and reveal himself as the God of peace, Quetzalcoatl.
