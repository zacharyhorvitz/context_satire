 Bill Clinton's history of speeches at the Democratic National Convention has been like his political career, a series of ups and downs, where the former president has played the role of validator, acceptor and character witness. The 42nd commander in chief has been allotted most of the 10 p.m. prime-time hour Tuesday night and Clinton aides expect him to speak for over 45 minutes. This will be the 10th speech Clinton has delivered to the DNC in his career. Clinton, who worked on the remarks holed up in the Logan Philadelphia hotel, wrote the entire speech by hand and without the input of people who regularly help him on remarks, aides said.  Bernie Sanders sought to show a united front at the Democratic National Convention Tuesday by asking delegates to accept Hillary Clinton's nomination unanimously and by acclimation. The plan came at the end of the roll call vote of all 50 states. "I move that Hillary Clinton be selected as the nominee of the Democratic party for President of the United States," Sanders told the convention. The move came as Sanders has attempted to tamp down his rowdy supporters, at times getting booed by his own backers as he called for Democratic unity. The 2016 presidential campaign of Martin O'Malley, the 61st Governor of Maryland, was formally launched on May 30, 2015 as Governor O'Malley announced his intention to seek the Democratic Party nomination for the presidency of the United States in the 2016 presidential election. On February 1, 2016, he suspended his campaign after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses.
