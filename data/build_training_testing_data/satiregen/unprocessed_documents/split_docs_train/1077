In 2010, the Central Dauphin School District applied for and was awarded a $2,099,888 grant, by the state and federal government. The money had to be used to transform the high school. The Transformation process specifies that the administration use of rigorous, transparent, and equitable evaluation systems for teachers and principals, high-quality professional development and design and development of curriculum with teacher and principal involvement. The school qualified for the grant due to the chronic low student achievement. In 2012, Central Dauphin East High School declined further to Corrective Action II 6th Year due to persistent, low student achievement. The school achieved 2 out of 10 academic metrics measured. Under the federal No Child Left Behind Act, the school administration was required to notify parents of the school's poor achievement outcomes and to offer the parent the opportunity to transfer to a successful school within the district. Additionally the school administration was required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, to develop a School Improvement Plan to address the school's low student achievement. The Philadelphia School of Pedagogy was a program for Central graduates who wanted to become elementary school teachers. It was the male counterpart to the Philadelphia's normal school, originally the upper division of Philadelphia High School for Girls.
