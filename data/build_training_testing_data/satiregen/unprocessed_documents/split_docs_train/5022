An Oreo () is a sandwich cookie consisting of two (usually chocolate) wafers with a sweet cr√®me filling. Introduced in 1912, Oreo is the best selling cookie brand in the United States. As of 2018, the version sold in the U.S. is made by the Nabisco division of Mondelez International. Oreos are available in over one hundred countries; in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, they are referred to as Oreo biscuits.  ESPN is denying allegations of sexual harassment against one of its anchors, John Buccigross. In addition to denying the allegations, ESPN also on Thursday released text messages between the alleged victim and Buccigross to show that they had, in ESPN's words, a "consensual, personal friendship that spanned months." The Boston Globe had reported Thursday evening that Adrienne Lawrence, a former on-air personality, lodged a complaint in which she claimed she was sexually harassed by Buccigross and then faced retaliation from ESPN for having brought his alleged actions to the attention of superiors and HR. ESPN said in a statement that it "conducted a thorough investigation and found these claims to be entirely without merit."
