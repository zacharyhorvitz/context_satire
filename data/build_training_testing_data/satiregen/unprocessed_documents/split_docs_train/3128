Governor Chris Christie's political standing was badly damaged by the scandal, and his approval ratings from the scandal onward only continued to fall. Once considered a leading contender for the 2016 Republican nomination for President, Christie dropped out of the presidential race after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary. The scandal was widely cited as a major factor in the early demise of Christie's 2016 presidential ambitions. Christie called Bridgegate "a factor" in why he was bypassed by Donald Trump as the vice presidential nominee.  Forty-two delegates are up for grabs when Wisconsin holds its Republican presidential primary Tuesday, but for Rick Santorum, much more appears to be at stake. The Badger State may be the former senator from Pennsylvania's final chance to convince Republicans that the race for the GOP nomination isn't over. Wisconsin joins Maryland and the District of Columbia in holding primaries on Tuesday. While polls suggest former Massachusetts Gov.  Rick Santorum turns his focus to his home state of Pennsylvania on Wednesday as he faces an uphill battle to convince Republicans he can stop Mitt Romney from clinching the party nomination after his three-primary sweep. Romney's wins in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia put him past the halfway mark to the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination and add to a wide lead over other GOP presidential candidates, according to CNN estimates. Yet Santorum indicated Tuesday night he would compete in the April 24 primaries in five states, including Pennsylvania, where his campaign hopes a win would be a gateway to a run of May primaries in states where he can capitalize on higher percentages of conservative voters. Romney, in a speech to supporters in Milwaukee, made no mention of his GOP rivals and instead mostly contrasted himself with President Barack Obama.
