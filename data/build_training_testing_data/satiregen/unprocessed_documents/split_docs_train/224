In the press conference, Barr asked that people look into the context, stating that President Trump "faced an unprecedented situation  federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office and the conduct of some of his associates. There was relentless speculation in the news media about the President's personal culpability", even though there was, according to Barr, "no collusion". Barr continued that there was "substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents and fueled by illegal leaks". Also in the press conference, Barr said that he asked Mueller "whether or not  was taking the position that he would have found a crime but for the existence of the OLC opinion" that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Mueller assumed he would end up working in industry and so, in his senior year, went on a tour of various suitable companies. He applied to RCA, General Electric and Emerson but when he graduated in 1939 the economy took another downturn and he, like most of the class, had no job. He labels his signing on the role of David Connor on Damages, the fiancé of the protagonist, as being "lucky", praising the script of the show and also the fact that it is shot in New York City, where he is currently living. He also says he was aware that his character dies in the first season and was disappointed but "thrilled" for the opportunity to have a full season. He also summarizes working with Glenn Close, Željko Ivanek and Ted Danson as "a dream come true". Bean returned for guest appearances in one episode each of the show's second, third, and fifth seasons.
