Tidying Up with Marie Kondo is a reality television series developed for Netflix and released on January 1, 2019. The show follows Marie Kondo, a Japanese organizing consultant and creator of the KonMari method, as she visits families to help them organize and tidy their homes. Marie Iida acts as Marie Kondo's interpreter throughout the show.  A contestant in an Afghan talent show has shot to fame thanks to his resemblance to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and even admitted his wife and family members see the likeness. "I was shocked when I learned I resembled Trudeau, especially when all my friends called and told me that I look like him," Abdul Salam Maftoon, from the northeastern province of Badakhshan, told CNN. The 28-year-old wedding singer is currently competing in the television music competition "Afghan Star." It was one of the judges on the show who first remarked on Maftoon's familiar look, turning the singer into an overnight celebrity. Kondo says that she has been interested in organizing since childhood. In junior school, Kondo ran into the classroom to tidy up bookshelves while her classmates were playing in physical education class. Whenever there were nominations for class roles, she did not seek to be the class representative or the pet feeder. Instead, she yearned to be the bookshelf manager to continue to tidy up books.
