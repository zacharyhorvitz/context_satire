Within hours of the story breaking, ZZZZ Best's banks either called their loans or threatened to do so. Drexel postponed closing until it could investigate further. Later that day at a press conference, a reporter detonated another bombshell. She had evidence that the Sacramento project didn't even exist. Minkow was born in Inglewood, California to a Jewish family, and was raised in the Reseda area of the San Fernando Valley. When he was nine years old, his mother got him a job as a telemarketer with the carpet-cleaning business where she worked. At the age of 15, while a sophomore at Cleveland High School, Minkow started ZZZZ Best in his parents' garage with three employees and four phones. In the early days, he had to rely on friends to drive him to jobs since he did not have a driver's license. Willard's stage career began when he moved to New York in the late 1950s. His initial work included a production of Desperate Hours at a local YMCA where he worked with future comedy partner Vic Grecco. They later performed under the moniker Willard & Grecco in the Greenwich Village area. The comedy team found some success touring, and made appearances on The Dean Martin Show, The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, and The Tonight Show.
