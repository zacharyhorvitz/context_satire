It was announced by Donald Trump in August 2017 that his daughter would lead the U.S. delegation to India in the fall in a global support of women's entrepreneurship.

The majority of reactions to her actual performance alongside P.M. Modi at the event were substantial.  Almost two months after President Donald Trump said he would quickly name a replacement for Nikki Haley, he is still struggling to pick his next ambassador to the United Nations. At first, former deputy national security adviser to the President Dina Powell was under consideration, then took herself out of contention. Then a long list of candidates were floated including Kay Bailey Hutchison, the ambassador to NATO; Nancy Brinker, founder of the Susan G.

White House chief of staff John Kelly will be leaving his position at the end of the year, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Saturday afternoon. CNN on Friday reported that Kelly was expected to announce his departure in the coming days. "John Kelly will be leaving at the end of the year," Trump told reporters before departing the White House for the Army-Navy game. Trump noted Kelly had been with him for almost two years in his roles as chief of staff and secretary of homeland security.
