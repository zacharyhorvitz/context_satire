In late 2018, speculation began that O'Rourke might run in the 2020 United States presidential election. Before the midterm elections, The New Republic claimed that O'Rourke's Senate campaign was laying the groundwork for a potential presidential bid, especially since he was likely to lose his Senate race. However, O'Rourke had repeatedly ruled out a presidential bid when asked on the campaign trail. He told MSNBC, "I will not be a candidate for president in 2020.  Beto O'Rourke just received a big eleventh hour show of support from one very famous Texan. Hours before the polls closed in Texas, superstar singer Beyoncé took to Instagram to show her support for the Texas Democratic Senate candidate. Beyoncé, a native of Houston, didn't directly address O'Rourke in the caption to her photo, in which she wears a "Beto for Senate" hat. But she used the platform to encourage her Bey-hive to go to the polls. During the campaign, she made multiple solo public appearances, speaking on her husband's behalf. Former George W. Bush administration official Sara Taylor Fagen said she was successful in softening her husband's image, which she further argued was essential for "a candidate whose main obstacle to the Republican nomination may be tone and personality", though director of the SuperPAC Our Principles PAC Katie Packer argued her help could only go so far and voters would not support a candidate based on their spouse.
