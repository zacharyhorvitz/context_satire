Three individuals suspected to be militants from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula were killed when their vehicle was struck by an air strike, in Yemen's northern province of al-Jawf on Sunday, Defense Ministry officials told CNN. The attack took place in Khab Shiyaf district, one of the residential areas of the province and near the Saudi border with Yemen. The officials would not confirm whether a U.S. drone was involved in the operation. Two security officials told CNN that among the killed was Saleh Huraidan, considered by Yemeni authorities as a senior leader in AQAP.
