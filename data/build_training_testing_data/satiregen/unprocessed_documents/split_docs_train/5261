Cullis-Suzuki was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia. Her mother is writer Tara Elizabeth Cullis. Her father, geneticist and environmental activist David Suzuki, is a third-generation Japanese Canadian. While attending Lord Tennyson Elementary School in French Immersion, at age 9, she founded the Environmental Children's Organization (ECO), a group of children dedicated to learning and teaching other youngsters about environmental issues. As Columbia reached its maximum planned capacity, developers turned to the eastern portion of Howard County served by public water and sewer for infill development opportunities. The Howard County School system increased substantially in size, but development in the county outpaced the number of seats available for students. In 2006, an adequate public facilities ordinance (APFO) was enacted. It temporarily limited development in elementary school districts only which were over 120% capacity. The building was destroyed by fire on 23 January 1922 while most were in attendance at a basketball game. A chimney fire spread to the dormitory roof, burning all but the gymnasium. The school merged with Calvert Hall College High School in Baltimore. A new elementary school was built within the existing walls in 1926 and remained until 1976, when Worthington Elementary School opened.
