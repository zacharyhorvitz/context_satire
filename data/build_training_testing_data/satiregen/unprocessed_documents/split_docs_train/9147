Writer-director Wakefield Poole avidly studied the Bible as a child, and wanted to tell three stories from the Old Testament from a female perspective, as he felt that biblical narratives often cast women in a negative light. He wanted to make the film without dialogue, instead staging it to a musical composition, à la "an adult Fantasia." Poole initially wanted to cast Charles Ludlam and Lola Pashalinski respectively as David and Bathsheba, but after encountering creative differences with Ludlam, Poole instead cast Georgina Spelvin as Bathsheba and his neighbor John Horn as David. In order to protect his career, Horn was credited as "Nicholas Flammel". Poole married Clara Evans (1899–1972) on March 7, 1917. In 1923, the Poole family was among hundreds of thousands of black families forming the First Great Migration leaving the oppressive and economically troubled South in search of safety and employment. Poole later recounted that before the age of 20, he had witnessed the lynchings of three black men by white people. He said, "I seen enough of the white man's brutality to last me 26,000 years". While he was in Detroit, Poole began taking part in various Black Nationalist movements within the city. In August 1931, at the urging of his wife, Elijah Poole attended a speech on Islam and black empowerment by Wallace Fard Muhammad (Wallace D. Fard). Afterward, Poole said he approached Fard and asked if he was the "Mahdi" (redeemer). Fard responded that he was, but that his time had not yet come.
