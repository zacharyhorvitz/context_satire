Shirley Churchill of Cheyenne, Wyoming, a long-time friend of Taylor, said that she did not "know of anyone who has been or will probably ever be a better advocate of Cheyenne Frontier Days than Dan Taylor. He could make a decision without worrying what someone else thought. Dan was a phenomenon to run Chute 9 because his reputation was never for sale". Tom Hines, another Taylor friend, described him as a "cowboy's cowboy".  Seattle has been suffering through its snowiest February in 70 years, with accumulations of up to 10 inches in some places. But all that white has meant green for one young man with a snowplow, who says he made $35,000 in four days. David Holston, 18, works as a landscaper and plowing snow in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Holston was in Seattle visiting his mother, who was recovering from surgery. As chute boss at Cheyenne Frontier Days in Chute 9, Taylor "runs a tight ship in the timed chutes" says Tom Hines, one of the staff. In fact, "Taylor Time" is known as five minutes early". When he says it starts at 7 a.m., it's going to start at 6:55", Hines says. "I've never seen him late for anything".
