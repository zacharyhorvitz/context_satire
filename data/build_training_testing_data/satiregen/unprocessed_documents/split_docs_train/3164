 Reports that the White House has a tentative plan to replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that emerged Thursday were an effort to express President Donald Trump's deep displeasure and publicly shame his secretary of state, a source with direct knowledge of the White House's thinking said Thursday. The hope from the White House, the source said, is to push out the plan to replace Tillerson and then "wait for him to punch out." The news that the White House is seriously considering replacing Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo comes as Trump remains deeply frustrated with his secretary of state, another source familiar with the President's thinking said. And the plan is not just being considered at the staff level, but by the President himself, the source said.  It was in July, just a handful of weeks after Melania Trump and her 11-year-old son, Barron, had moved in to the White House full time, that the first lady started to think about something important on her agenda: Christmas. With the entire White House to fill with some of the country's most important holiday décor, Trump, as she has done with other issues, began to research, ultimately landing on a theme for her first White House holiday season, according to East Wing communications director Stephanie Grisham. On Monday, the first lady will unveil "Time-Honored Traditions," which she personally designed, with a nod to the past 200 years of White House holidays. "Like many families across the country, holiday traditions are very important to us," Trump said in a statement to CNN. The cousins went back to the farmhouse to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer. In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint on the underside of the mantelpiece above the Aga cooker. DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a paint sample from the mantelpiece on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer.
