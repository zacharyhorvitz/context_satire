Between April and November 1968, various investigations continue during the creation of Thames Valley Constabulary from the city and county police forces. The future of Cowley police station is in question, along with those of some of the key members of the team there. Morse, now a DS, is assigned with a new DC, George Fancy, and becomes annoyed with his lack of focus initially. Joan is back in town and occasionally bumps into Morse around Oxford. The final episode, with the gang rivalry looming all over town, includes the death of DC George Fancy (who gets hit by bullets that do not match any of those of the crossfire between gangs that occurred where he was found) and the departure of WPC Shirley Trewlove to Scotland Yard, while the rest come to terms with the death and the closure of the Cowley Station. The series concludes with Morse asking Joan Thursday if her offer to go for coffee was still open (after he had said no to having coffee with her earlier in the series). In the last scene, they look at one another before Joan responds. Although Rupert  performed nearly all the music himself, there are notable contributions from The Fixx's Jamie West-Oram, Stewart Copeland of The Police and Café Jacque's vocalist Chris Thomson. Followers of Rupert Hine’s prior projects were intrigued to see him fronting the group: a departure from his earlier solo work. The four-piece, which appeared on television programmes across Europe in support of the record, combined its music with a mission to call out the dangers of the all-too-powerful Media. Unusually, and with a finely judged sense of irony, the men who accompanied Rupert in public appearances were actors, not musicians (Greg Crutwell, Andy Baker and Julian Clary).
