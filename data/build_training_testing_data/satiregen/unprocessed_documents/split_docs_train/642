 Sen. Kamala Harris ended her 2020 presidential campaign on Tuesday, an abrupt departure for a candidate who was once seen as a leading contender for the Democratic nomination. The California Democrat told her senior staff of the decision Tuesday morning, and later sent an email to supporters and released a video on Twitter. "To you my supporters, my dear supporters, it is with deep regret -- but also with deep gratitude -- that I am suspending our campaign today," Harris said in the video. "But I want to be clear with you: I am still very much in this fight," Harris continued.  Kamala Harris fell as quickly as she rose. The California senator entered the 2020 presidential race in January a top contender for the Democratic nomination, someone whose political chops after ascending from prosecutor to attorney general to senator instantly made her one of the top 2020 candidates. Less than a year later, and exactly two months before the Iowa caucuses, she exits as a candidate who failed to live up to the hype and was unable to raise enough money to keep her campaign going. Harris' abrupt decision on Tuesday makes the senator the most high-profile candidate to date to drop out of the race to challenge President Donald Trump, and is the culmination of months of disjointed messaging, contentious infighting among top aides and severe money issues that plagued the campaign.  Former Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday he would consider Sen. Kamala Harris as a potential running mate, a day after she dropped out of the presidential race. "Of course I would," Biden said. "Look, Sen. Harris has the capacity to be anything she wants to be. I mean it sincerely.
