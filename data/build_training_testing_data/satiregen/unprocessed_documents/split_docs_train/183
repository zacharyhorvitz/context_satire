For the 2014–15 season, after cancelling Piers Morgan Tonight (which, itself, replaced the long-running Larry King Live), CNN experimented with running factual and reality-style programming during the 9:00 p.m. ET hour,  such as John Walsh's The Hunt, This Is Life with Lisa Ling, and Mike Rowe's Somebody's Gotta Do It. Jeff Zucker explained that this new lineup was intended to shift CNN away from a reliance on pundit-oriented programs, and attract younger demographics to the network. Zucker stated that the 9:00 p.m. hour could be pre-empted during major news events for expanded coverage.  For this election like none other, CNN is available like never before. Here are *some* of the extraordinary elements of our coverage, and where you can find us beyond CNN TV and CNN.com. We'll be live streaming ... CNN will stream live its broadcast coverage across digital platforms from 4 p.m. ET  Election Day to 4 a.m. Wednesday.  Hillary Clinton -- joined by her husband, Bill, and their daughter, Chelsea -- campaigned a final time with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama Monday night, in front of tens of thousands of supporters before the historic Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The group celebrated the history Obama made eight years ago, as the first African-American to win the White House, and expressed optimism that the next day Clinton will make a different kind of history as the first woman to be elected to the highest office. Still hours away from Tuesday morning when polls would open on the East Coast, Obama issued an urgent warning in what would be one of his final and most importance speeches as president. Live election coverage "The choice you face when you step into that voting booth could not be more clear or could not be more serious," Obama said, moments before the Liberty Bell rang out to mark a new hour.
