 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is slated to talk later today at the United Nations General Assembly. Ahmadinejad’s speech follows one from president Obama, who yesterday laid out clear opposition to any encroachment on a nuclear Iran. A mile away at the Clinton Global Initiative GOP nominee Mitt Romney kept up his attack on the president's foreign policy. This morning, Romney supporter and former Mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani (R-NY) joins “Starting Point” to discuss Obama’s foreign policy decisions.  With 35 days till the election, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney prepare to face off at the first presidential debate on Wednesday. While the debate will focus on both economic and domestic policy issues, Governor Bob McDonnell (R-VA) argues that Romney should concentrate on the economy, where he believes the Republican candidate has an edge. McDonnell also argues that questions on immigration will not hurt the Republican candidate, stating that immigration is not “an issue that is going to move a lot of voters.”  The split screen told the story -- when Mitt Romney was speaking, President Barack Obama was looking down; when Obama was speaking, Romney was looking at the president. "It has killed jobs," Romney said during Wednesday's debate about the politically charged health care law pushed by Obama. "Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said, will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance." Romney looked at the crowd, moderator Jim Lehrer and even Obama during the exchange.
