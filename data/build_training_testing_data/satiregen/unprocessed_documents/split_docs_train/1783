 President Donald Trump slammed James Comey on Friday as a "weak and untruthful slime ball" and a "proven LEAKER & LIAR," the day after explosive excerpts from the former FBI director's tell-all book surfaced in media reports. "James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted.  President Donald Trump believes that fired FBI Director James Comey is "engaging in revisionist history" in his new tell-all book, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Monday. "He loves to divert the spotlight to himself and be the center of power," Conway told CNN's "New Day" Monday morning. Comey, who maintains that both he and the FBI are impartial, has said during congressional testimony that he was uncomfortable with the President's desire to meet with him alone and his alleged request for Comey's personal loyalty. "If he objected to anything that he had witnessed in his very limited, very few meetings with President Trump, he should have said so.  Former FBI Director James Comey wrote in his book that President Donald Trump discussed looking into one of the most infamous allegations in a dossier of claims about Trump and Russia. In the book, which CNN obtained Thursday, Comey wrote that Trump wanted him to prove the allegation was false in part to prove its falsehood to his wife, first lady Melania Trump. "He brought up what he called the 'golden showers thing,'" Comey wrote. The dossier was commissioned as opposition research by political opponents of then-candidate Trump and compiled by a former British intelligence agent.
