 Democrats on Tuesday made Hillary Clinton the first woman to head a major party ticket -- and during an emotional night, her family and supporters asked voters to give her a second look. At the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, just three miles from Independence Hall where the nation was born, a sense of history is palpable -- as is Clinton's willingness to finally enjoy it. "What an incredible honor that you have given me, and I can't believe we just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet," Clinton said via satellite after a video montage showed the faces of all 44 male presidents before shattering like glass to reveal Clinton waiting to address the convention from New York. "This is really your victory.  The Democratic A-list on Wednesday cast Donald Trump as a threat to the American dream -- and Hillary Clinton as the nation's only chance to save it. President Barack Obama called Trump a "homegrown demagogue." Michael Bloomberg dismissed him as a "con." And Vice President Joe Biden, in rejecting Trump, declared that "Americans have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down."  President Barack Obama on Wednesday handed his legacy to Hillary Clinton, setting her up for the speech of her life with a powerful endorsement and the enduring image of a warm embrace. Clinton joined Obama on stage after his speech, and the President and his 2008 primary rival clung together in a shared moment of symbolism: the nation's first African-American leader entrusting its future to the woman who could become its first female commander-in-chief. Obama was in Philadelphia at the Democratic National Convention 12 years to the day after he shook politics with a convention speech in Boston that encouraged Americans to look at the common threads that unite them. He offered a similarly empowering vision of the nation Wednesday, saying America doesn't need a "self declared savior" like Donald Trump to fix it.
