On 1 February 2011, Pfizer announced it would be closing the entire research and development facility at Sandwich within 18â€“24 months, as part of a company-wide plan to exit certain therapeutic areas including allergy and respiratory research, which was based at Sandwich. In its announcement, Pfizer stated that most of the 2,400 workers at the site would be made redundant, although it hoped to transfer several hundred positions to other sites or to Pfizer partner companies. On 4 February 2011, it was announced that the Science and Technology Select Committee would be requesting oral evidence from representatives of Pfizer and the Minister of State for Universities and Science, David Willetts, on the closure of the Sandwich site. Neurontin began as one of Pfizer's best selling drugs; however, Pfizer was criticized and under litigation for its marketing of the drug (see Franklin v. Parke-Davis). Pfizer faced allegations that Parke-Davis marketed the drug for at least a dozen off-label uses that the FDA had not approved. It has been used as a mainstay drug for migraines, even though it was not approved for such use in 2004.  Two common naloxone products, Narcan and Evzio, remain chemically stable after their expiration dates, according to new research. Naloxone, the generic name for the drug, is sometimes called a "save shot" or a "rescue shot" because of its ability to bring someone back from an opioid overdose. It has long been used in hospitals and by emergency medical technicians, but as the opioid addiction crisis sweeps the nation, it has become more widely available to people addicted to drugs and those around them. Narcan, a naloxone nasal spray, was found to be chemically stable for 10 months after its labeled expiration date.
