Sid & Marty Krofft belong to the fifth generation of a family of puppeteers who had been successfully putting on puppet shows around the country, including Les Poup√©es de Paris, an adult puppet show. They had created the puppets for Hanna-Barbera's children's TV show The Banana Splits. In 1968 the NBC TV network asked them to create a Saturday morning TV show, and after a year of development the H.R. Pufnstuf program was launched in September 1969. Sid Krofft (born July 30, 1929) and Marty Krofft (born April 9, 1937) are a Canadian sibling team of television creators and puppeteers. Through their production company, Sid & Marty Krofft Pictures, they have made numerous children's television and variety show programs in the U.S., particularly in the 1970s and early 1980s. Their fantasy programs often feature large-headed puppets, high-concept plots, and extensive use of low-budget special effects. The Krofft brothers, Sid and Marty, were born in Montreal, Quebec. For years, they claimed to have been born to a family of fifth-generation puppeteers, but revealed in 2008 that this story was invented by a publicist in the 1940s. Their father, Peter Krofft was, in fact, a clock salesman who moved from Canada to Providence, Rhode Island, and then to New York City. Sid Krofft became a noted puppeteer who worked in vaudeville and was a featured player with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.
