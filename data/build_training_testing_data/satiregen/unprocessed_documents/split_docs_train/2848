Originally from Capreol, Ontario, she moved with her mother several times in childhood after her parents' divorce, finally spending her teen years in Barrie, Ontario. Her first-ever acting audition was for a role in the Donald Sutherland film Threshold, which went to Mare Winningham. She had early guest roles in Canadian television, and appeared as Carol Burnett's daughter in the television film Between Friends, before moving to New York City in 1985. She had just $1.87 in her savings account the day she won her role in Another World. At the repast, A.J. drunkenly reveals Anthony and Renee's affair and Renee exposes A.J.’s affair with Gia, which makes his wife Carol, to whom A.J. had been disrespectful all weekend finally decide to leave him. A.J. Naomi Soledad León Outlaw: the daughter of Santiago and Skyla, the great-granddaughter of Mary, and the sister of Owen; she is also the main protagonist and narrator of the story. Naomi is a quiet and shy but very naive Hispanic girl who has difficulty speaking up for herself and her younger brother Owen, and has lived with her brother and great-grandmother for most of her life. She is talented at soap carving and (as she puts it) "worrying and making lists" and also considers herself as "nobody special".
