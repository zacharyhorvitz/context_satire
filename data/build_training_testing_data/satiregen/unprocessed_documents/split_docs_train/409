While working at Gladdings in Providence, Rhode Island, Neimark's friends facilitated a blind date with Jackie Myers, the handbag buyer for T.W. Rounds, which specialized in prestige leather goods and, at its peak, had 11 locations in New England. She is the daughter of Harry M. and Yetta Goodman Myers, who owned T.W. Rounds. The five Fendi sisters were seated around a large oval dining room table. As Dawn and I presented our case to this forum of five powerful women, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were arranging a marriage contract of some sort. Later, as they were discussing the proposal among themselves in Italian, one of the sisters, Anna, directed a question to us in English. She had a daughter, Maria Theresa; when Maria comes to the States, would we take care of her? Neimark set out to transform the store from "old, dull, expensive, and intimidating" to "young, exciting, expensive, and intimidating". :153 His primary strategy was to put designers in the lead and, to that end, recruited Dawn Mello to head the store's fashion office.
