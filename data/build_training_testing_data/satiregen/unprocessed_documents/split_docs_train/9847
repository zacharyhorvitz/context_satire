Since the school is located in an agricultural community, many of the students at Hamilton are involved with Future Farmers of America, gaining skills in agriculture, agribusiness and leadership. The school has an on-campus farm where students can raise animals. The HWDSB has 15 wards and 11 trustees, who are each elected for a four-year term. The Chair of the Board, the Vice-Chair and the Honorary Treasurer are elected at the Inaugural meeting of the Board, and serve for one year. Trustees are officials, elected to serve parents, students, taxpayers and the school system. They are the link between communities and the school board, ensuring Hamilton public schools meet the diverse needs of students in their communities.
