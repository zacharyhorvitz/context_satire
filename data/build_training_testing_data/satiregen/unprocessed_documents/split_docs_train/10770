Typosquatting, also called URL hijacking, a sting site, or a fake URL, is a form of cybersquatting, and possibly brandjacking which relies on mistakes such as typos made by Internet users when inputting a website address into a web browser. Should a user accidentally enter an incorrect website address, they may be led to any URL (including an alternative website owned by a cybersquatter).The typosquatter's URL will usually be one of five kinds, all similar to the victim site address (e.g. example.com):A common misspelling, or foreign language spelling, of the intended site: exemple.comA misspelling based on typos: examlpe.comA differently phrased domain name: examples.comA different top-level domain: example.orgAn abuse of the Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD): example.cm by using .cm, example.co by using .co, or example.om by using .om. A person leaving out a letter in .com in error could arrive at the fake URL's website.Similar abuses:Combosquatting - no misspelling, but appending an arbitrary word that appears legitimate, but that anyone could register.
