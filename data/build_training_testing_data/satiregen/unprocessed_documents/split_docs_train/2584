In July 2019, after May's resignation, Johnson was elected as Conservative leader and appointed as Prime Minister. Johnson could not get Parliament to approve a revised withdrawal agreement by the end of October, and chose to call for a snap election. The House of Commons supported the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 by 438â€“20, setting the election date for 12 December. Johnson needed to obtain an overall majority in the election in order to accomplish his main goal of taking the United Kingdom out of the European Union by the end of January 2020.  When disaster strikes, it seems someone has to take the blame. Writing to a colleague in 1879, British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli expressed his fear that another bad harvest would lead to his political party losing the general election. True enough, after a fifth poor crop season, Disraeli's party lost office the following year. Democracy has moved on since then, and it's hard to imagine that an event like Superstorm Sandy would have much of a bearing on who will be sitting in the White House come January. The 2010 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday, 6 May 2010, with 45,597,461 registered voters entitled to vote to elect members to the House of Commons. The election took place in 650 constituencies across the United Kingdom under the first-past-the-post system. None of the parties achieved the 326 seats needed for an overall majority. The Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, won the largest number of votes and seats, but still fell 20 seats short.
