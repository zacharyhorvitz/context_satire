On 11 October 2018, Monaco dismissed Leonardo Jardim as club manager. Jardim's position had become untenable after struggling heavily in domestic competition, with the club 18th at the time of his departure, and disputes over the club's transfer policy. Monaco's search for a new coach coincided with the regulatory mid-season international break, allowing the club sufficient time to search for a replacement, however, they quickly decided on Henry, and he was appointed a mere two days later. He signed a three-year deal, and was unveiled as Monaco manager on 18 October. Allen Fryer told Sandra Cheskey that he was a police officer while they drove around, that he was "The Boss", and that the other two would do as he instructed them. After a short time, James and David Fryer met them on the road in the pickup. Allen and Sandy got into the truck, and the group drove to a farm. At this point, James Fryer raped Sandra Cheskey. Allen Fryer claimed that Cheskey's friends were the ones shooting at him and his brothers the night of the murders and they "accidentally" killed someone. By Allen's 3rd interview he told the truth but was still trying to justify their action saying the 5 teens had been drinking and smoking marijuana, and the Fryer brothers wanted to steal it. David Fryer told a similar story, and then later changed his story to what really happened.
