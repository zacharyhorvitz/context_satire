The question of the place of the art museum in its community has long been under debate. Some see art museums as fundamentally elitist institutions, while others see them as institutions with the potential for societal education and uplift. John Cotton Dana, an American librarian and museum director, as well as the founder of the Newark Museum, saw the traditional art museum as a useless public institution, one that focused more on fashion and conformity rather than education and uplift. Indeed, Dana's ideal museum would be one best suited for active and vigorous use by the average citizen, located near the center of their daily movement. A new controversy arose when the Milwaukee Art Museum's Santiago Calatrava-designed new wing opened in 2001. Dissenters advocated that The Calling be moved as it blocked their view of the new art museum. Di Suvero refused to move the sculpture, stating "If you don't want it, take it apart and ship it to me." When questioned whether the sculpture should be moved, Calatrava deferred to di Suvero. A controversy over the imposition of admittance fees on visitors who were not residents of the City of Milwaukee led to the museum being sold by the City to Milwaukee County in 1976. In 1992, amid assertions that the Museum was on the verge of bankruptcy and might have to be sold or completely privatized, a compromise was reached in which the museum's nominal ownership was retained by the county, but all operating control was handed over to Milwaukee Public Museum, Inc., a not-for-profit controlled by local business interests such as Miller Brewing. Employee wages and benefits were slashed, but private donations expanded and the county's share of costs was diminished.
