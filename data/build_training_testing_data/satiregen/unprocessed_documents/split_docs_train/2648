Panda Express, the most popular, has over 2,000 locations as of 2018, making it the largest Chinese fast food chain in the United States. In 1983, Andrew Cherng opened the first Panda Express, a fast food restaurant, at the newly opened Glendale Galleria II mall in Glendale, California. He had been prompted to start the spin off by the developer of the mall who had eaten at Panda Inn and invited Cherng to take a place at the food court. Panda Express is a fast food restaurant chain which serves American Chinese cuisine. With over 2,200 locations, it is the largest Asian segment restaurant chain in the United States, where it was founded and is mainly located (in addition to other countries and territories in North America and Asia). Panda Express restaurants were traditionally located in shopping mall food courts, but the chain now operates units in many other environments and formats, including stand-alone restaurants, as well as universities, casinos, airports, military bases, amusement parks and other venues. The chain offers a variety of Chinese-cuisine-inspired dishes (e.g., Orange Chicken; Sweet Fire Chicken Breast; Beijing Beef; Grilled Teriyaki Chicken; Kung Pao Chicken).
