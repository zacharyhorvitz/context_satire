GameStop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. GameStop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of Deus Ex: Human Revolution on OnLive, a cloud gaming service. GameStop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its subsidiaries, Spawn Labs and Impulse, which it had acquired in April 2011. Later, GameStop entirely removed the PC version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution from its stores. Batman: Arkham Knight was released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows on June 23, 2015. The game was originally scheduled to be released on October 14, 2014, which in turn was delayed to June 2, 2015. On the first delay, Rocksteady marketing game manager Guy Perkins stated, "If we didn’t give the team more time to do it, then we would be releasing something that we weren’t happy with. We want to make sure we’re absolutely nailing it 100%." The company has a policy where some copies of newly released games are opened and the game discs stored behind the counter so the cases can be put on display. Purchasers of the game receive a factory-sealed copy unless the opened copy is the last copy of the game in stock, where they'll receive the opened copy sold at regular price.
