 Many Americans are still failing to sock away enough money to pay for retirement -- or emergencies for that matter, according to a survey of more than 1,000 people released Monday. Only half of respondents reported good savings habits, including having a spending and/or saving plan in place, according to the Consumer Federation of America and the American Savings Education Council which conducted the survey. While more than half of all Baby Boomers and Gen-Xers will be able to retire with enough money to cover basic retirement needs, including health care costs, a significant number are at risk of running short, according to projections by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. The survey also found that only 49% of non-retired respondents feel they are saving enough to achieve a "desirable standard of living" in retirement.  Many borrowers are in a love-hate relationship with payday lenders: they say the loans rip them off, yet the relief of quick cash leaves them coming back for more. Payday loans are advertised as short-term credit lines, typically extended for two weeks to help  consumers get through to their next paycheck. Each year, nearly 12 million borrowers take out payday loans averaging $375 each. Yet, only 14% can afford to repay the $430 in principal and fees owed after two weeks, according to a Pew Charitable Trusts report based on interviews with more than 700 borrowers.  Think Paris, and the Eiffel Tower, the Champs-Élysées and haute couture come to mind. But the City of Light also is rich in African-American history. Keeping this history alive are tour companies that share it, up close and personal, with visitors to France. From legendary entertainer Josephine Baker to internationally acclaimed artist Henry Ossawa Tanner to World War I's ragtime-and-jazz-playing "Harlem Hellfighters," Paris has embraced African-American culture like few other places.
