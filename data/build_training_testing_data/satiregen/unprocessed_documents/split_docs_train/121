 Lock her up? Donald Trump and the Republicans used their convention to tell a very specific story: That Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, is corrupt and even a criminal. Although some time was devoted to talking about Trump the person on the final night, Cleveland witnessed a blistering series of attacks on Clinton, with the convention rhetoric sinking to historically low levels. Although Trump contained himself to saying "let's defeat her in November" the chants of "lock her up!"  It is official. He's with Her. On Monday night, Bernie Sanders finally did what all runners-up for a presidential nomination are tasked with doing. It is not easy and it certainly is humbling (ask Hillary Clinton, circa 2008).  One of the craziest and most tumultuous presidential primary seasons in recent memory comes to a head Monday as Donald Trump arrives in Cleveland for the Republican National Convention. Conventions are meant to be festive but tightly disciplined events, a rare moment when the Republican party can control the program, reintroduce their candidate and launch him into the fall campaign with a bump in the polls. The political universe will be watching whether Trump -- rarely known for his discipline -- can stick to his script. Will he unite a party unraveled by his candidacy, or will he blow it apart?
