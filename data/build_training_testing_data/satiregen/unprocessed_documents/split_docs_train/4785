Artists of the 18th and 19th centuries striving to evoke republican ideals commonly used representations of Libertas as an allegorical symbol. A figure of Liberty was also depicted on the Great Seal of France. However, Bartholdi and Laboulaye avoided an image of revolutionary liberty such as that depicted in Eugène Delacroix's famed Liberty Leading the People (1830). In this painting, which commemorates France's July Revolution, a half-clothed Liberty leads an armed mob over the bodies of the fallen. We announce in our obituary this week the death of the Rev. Peter Grant, Baptist Minister, Grantown, at the advanced age of 84. Mr. Grant was in many respects a remarkable man, and we regret that we have not materials in our possession to enable us to give anything like a worthy record of his life. He was descended from respectable ancestors in Strathspey, and succeeded his father as a farmer in the parish of Cromdale. After the United States entered World War I in 1917, images of the statue were heavily used in both recruitment posters and the Liberty bond drives that urged American citizens to support the war financially. This impressed upon the public the war's stated purpose—to secure liberty—and served as a reminder that embattled France had given the United States the statue.
