Although the band seemed to have maintained their momentum and recovered well from the split of the original lineup, they were about to be hit by a serious tragedy. Unknown to the rest of Level 42, guitarist Alan Murphy was suffering from AIDS, something which he himself may have been aware of before joining the band. At the time, his previous band Go West had been stalled by internal disagreements, and one of Murphy's reasons for joining Level 42 was to ensure that he spent his last days playing the music that he loved. During 1989, Murphy contracted pneumonia: weakened by his existing condition, his decline was rapid and he died on 19 October 1989. My mother and father broke up when I was three, and he died when I was eight, so I have very dim memories (â€¦) He was a victim of the Murphy charm (laughs). A woman stabbed my father. I never got all the logistics. It was supposed to be one of those crimes of passion: 'If I can't have you, no one else will'-kind of deal. In the music video for Kate Bush's version of "Rocket Man", released as part of the 1991 Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin tribute album, she performs with her band but there is an empty chair, a guitar and a candle where Murphy would have been and cross-faded footage of him playing in the closing choruses. "This is one of the last tracks that he did with us," Bush told BBC Radio 1, "and it's particularly nice for me to feel that it's not only keeping him alive, but I know he would be really thrilled to know that  was doing so well. And it's nice for all of us that loved Al to know that he can be a part of this now."
