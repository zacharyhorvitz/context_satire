 California's largest utility company is warning about 850,000 customers that another intentional power outage may leave them in the dark this weekend. Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) has been cutting off electricity for customers in northern and central California over the past weeks in an attempt to avoid sparking wildfires. But this could be the utility's largest outage this year. Estimates indicate the potential outage could affect more than 2 million people, a spokesperson with the company said.  Nearly a million homes and businesses in California were slowly going dark Saturday as the state's largest utility shut off power in an attempt to avoid "catastrophic" wildfires. Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) cut power to some 940,000 customers across 38 counties in Northern and Central California for what could be an unprecedented wind event. The power was turned off in phases through Saturday night and will begin to be restored Monday, the utility said. Hurricane-force winds with gusts up to 90 mph could hit the state Saturday night into Sunday, adding to the already fire-prone conditions in the state.  California's largest utility is working to restore power to tens of thousands of customers after another round of intentional power cuts in Northern California. About 179,000 customers who lost electricity in the latest effort to prevent the Pacific Gas and Electric Company's equipment from sparking wildfires will have power by Friday night or sooner, the utility announced Thursday. The blackout has impacted parts of 17 counties, including Sonoma and Napa since it started Wednesday. A weather "all clear" was issued for most counties after wind conditions improved Thursday morning.
