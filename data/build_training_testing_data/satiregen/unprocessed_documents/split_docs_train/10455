The diagnosis of AOS is a clinical diagnosis based on the specific features described above. A system of major and minor criteria was proposed. Hudson joined the United States Marine Corps immediately after high school but was discharged after only three months on medical grounds due to asthma. Having moved to Detroit, Michigan, he became the resident playwright at Concept East, the oldest black theatre company in the United States. He enrolled at Wayne State University to further develop his writing and acting skills, graduating in 1973. He established the Actors' Ensemble Theatre where he and other talented young black writers directed and appeared in their own works. The combination of two major criteria would be sufficient for the diagnosis of AOS, while a combination of one major and one minor feature would be suggestive of AOS. Genetic testing can be performed to test for the presence of mutation in one of the known genes, but these so far only account for an estimated 50% of patients with AOS. A definitive diagnosis may therefore not be achieved in all cases.
