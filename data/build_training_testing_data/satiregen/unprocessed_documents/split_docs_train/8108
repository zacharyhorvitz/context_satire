 The top two Republican leaders in Congress declined Tuesday to embrace a popular bill moving through the Senate that would allow families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia. House Speaker Paul Ryan expressed caution about unintended consequences of the legislation, which would clear the way for suits over Riyadh's alleged role in the terror attacks, and said the House would not rush the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, was asked if he supports the bill and would put it on the floor. He would only say he is "still looking" at it and that he doesn't have "any announcement to make."  President Barack Obama said the worst mistake of his presidency was a lack of planning for the aftermath of the 2011 toppling of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. "Probably failing to plan for the day after what I think was the right thing to do in intervening in Libya," he said in a Fox News interview aired Sunday. This is not the first time in recent weeks he has talked about Libya and the NATO-led intervention which resulted in Gadhafi's death in October of that year, months after NATO first intervened. READ: Why Libya is on verge of implosion In a profile published last month in The Atlantic, the President told author Jeffrey Goldberg that British Prime Minister David Cameron became "distracted by a range of other things" after the operation. A common claim among those arguing that President Obama was not born in Hawaii is that all doubt would be settled if Obama released his "long form" birth certificate. However, commentators noted that doing so would be disadvantageous to Obama. First, it would encourage speculation as to why it took so long to release the document. Second, caving in to his political adversaries' demands would embolden them by giving them a victory.
