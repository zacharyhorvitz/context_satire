Marimba bars produce their fullest sound when struck just off center, while striking the bar in the center produces a more articulate tone. On chromatic marimbas, the accidentals (black keys) can also be played on the extreme front edge of the bar, away from the node (the place where the string goes through the bar) if necessary. Playing on the node produces a sonically weak tone, and the technique is only used when the player or composer is looking for a muted sound from the instrument. Emma Fall Schofield was, along with Sadie Lipner Shulman, the first female judge in Massachusetts. Even after being appointed as a judge and professor, Schofield continued to study. She was enrolled at the Calvin Coolidge College of Liberal Arts from 1953 to 1956. She studied across the United States, Europe, and Africa to write her doctoral dissertation on juvenile delinquency. She received a Doctor of Education degree from Coolidge College in 1956.
