 British police entered the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on Thursday, forcibly removing the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on a US extradition warrant and bringing his seven-year stint there to a dramatic close. Video showed a heavily bearded Assange shouting and gesticulating as multiple officers hustled him into a waiting police van. He was arrested on charges that he skipped bail in the UK in 2012 and at the request of US authorities, London's Metropolitan police said. Officers moved in after Ecuador withdrew his asylum and invited authorities into the embassy, citing Assange's bad behavior.  A teenager died after falling from the Whispering Gallery inside St. Paul's Cathedral on Monday, according to authorities. City of London Police said they were summoned to the cathedral just before 4 pm local time because of "a report of a male in his late teens who had fallen from the gallery within the building." Police added, "His death is not being treated as suspicious." The Whispering Gallery is 30 meters, or 98 feet, from the Anglican cathedral's floor, according to the cathedral's official website.  Julian Assange's refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London has come to an end. The WikiLeaks founder had been living in the embassy since 2012, after the South American country granted him political asylum. But on Thursday morning, Lenin Moreno, Ecuador's President, said that due to his "discourteous and aggressive behavior," "the hostile and threatening declarations of his allied organization against Ecuador" and "the transgression of international treaties," Assange's asylum had been withdrawn. Assange's rise to fame Assange became a household name in April 2010, when his website, WikiLeaks, published a video showing a US military helicopter firing on and killing two journalists working for Reuters and several Iraqi civilians in 2007.
