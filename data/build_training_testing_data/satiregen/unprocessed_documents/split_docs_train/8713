 Many Americans are planning to get a glimpse of Prince William and his wife, Kate Middleton when they arrive in New York City next week -- and it seems that President Barack Obama wants in as well. The President has invited Prince William to meet with him in the Oval Office on Monday. Before The Duke of Cambridge leaves the White House grounds, Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Biden are expected to host him in a separate event. Kate will not join her husband on the D.C. leg of their three-day trip, opting to tour a child development center with New York City's first lady Chirlane McCray instead.  Prince William and Kate got the royal treatment Monday. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chatted with President Obama and Hillary Clinton, received cheers from people on the street and met Jay-Z, Beyonce and King James -- also known as basketball star LeBron James. They even got a look at American-style protest as demonstrators marched outside Barclays Center in Brooklyn to show their anger about the lack of an indictment in the Eric Garner chokehold death. William and Kate arrived Sunday for a three-day trip, their first to the Big Apple.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived in New York City on Sunday as they begin a busy three-day visit to the United States. A crowd gathered outside the hotel where William and Kate are staying hours before the royal couple arrived. Police were on hand to keep the crowds a safe distance away. Many of those who gathered said they were more interested in catching a glimpse of Kate, who is pregnant with her second child.
