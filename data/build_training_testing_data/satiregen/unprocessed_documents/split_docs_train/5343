 Donald Trump's supporters on Capitol Hill said Thursday they know the stakes are high for Monday night's debate and could set the tone for the sprint to Election Day. "Donald Trump knows, the team knows that Monday night is going to be not necessarily make or break, but the momentum coming out of Monday night could be critical on both sides and Donald Trump knows that," said Rep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican, as he walked out of what could be the final meeting of Trump's congressional supporters. "He's likely to bring up some Clinton issues. I think we're going to see some give and take there," Collins said.  Donald Trump praised Lester Holt's performance as moderator of Monday night's presidential debate, contradicting claims by his supporters that Holt had been unfair. "I thought Lester did a great job. Honestly, I thought Lester did a great job," Trump told CNNMoney shortly after the debate was over. When asked if the questions had been fair, Trump replied: "Yeah, I thought it was very fair."  In Hillary Clinton's eyes, Donald Trump knows he lost Monday night. Clinton, speaking with reporters on her plane, threw serious shade at Trump hours after the two met for the first presidential debate at Hofstra Univeristy. The former secretary of state gloated that she had a great night and said Trump, who complained about his microphone after the debate, knew he lost. As she walked away from reporters, Clinton was asked about Trump's complaints.
