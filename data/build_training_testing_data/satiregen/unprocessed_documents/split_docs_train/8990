In February 2013, Omarosa returned to television and The Apprentice, appearing on Trump's All-Star Celebrity Apprentice. Omarosa quickly marshalled her team to an early victory on the show, winning a task involving the creation of a photo booth at Universal Orlando. In a later episode, Lil Jon's team was brought back to the boardroom after they lost. Piers Morgan remarked, "my argument against you has always been that you're not a celebrity... and you don't have star power," which led to a heated argument that resulted in Trump firing Omarosa. Dr. Jesse Newman (Barbara Eden) is now counselling members of the San Francisco Police Department and assigned to treating David Zaccariah (Michael Nouri), a grieving policeman who lost his partner of ten years in a shootout. Days later, it seems that the case is wrapped up when the perfect suspect is apprehended. But David has inadvertently given the most important clue of all to the person he should have most avoided: Jesse Newman. It's a lucky coin that belonged to his partner, and it triggers a revealing series of psychic visions for Jesse. Newman appeared on the first season of Celebrity Big Brother, a spin-off of the Big Brother series. The show aired on the CBS network, February 7 to 25, 2018. Newman remained in the game throughout that time, surviving elimination and winning multiple competitions right up until the finale, where she was one of the last five contestants standing. At one point, host Julie Chen speculated that Omarosa could win the entire season.
