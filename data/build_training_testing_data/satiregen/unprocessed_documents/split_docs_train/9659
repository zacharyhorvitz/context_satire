Brussels (French: Bruxelles  (listen) or ; Dutch: Brussel  (listen)), officially the Brussels-Capital Region (French: RÃ©gion de Bruxelles-Capitale; Dutch: Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest), is a region of Belgium comprising 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels, which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is located in the central portion of the country and is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the Flemish Region (which forms an enclave) and the Walloon Region. Brussels is the most densely populated and the richest region in Belgium in terms of GDP per capita. It covers 162 km2 (63 sq mi), a relatively small area compared to the two other regions, and has a population of over 1.2 million.  The most stringent curbs on bankers' pay since the 2008 financial crisis are to be imposed by the EU, as Britain faces defeat in Brussels over an issue dear to the City of London. Talks on EU reforms to make banks safer are entering a potentially decisive week with London heavily outgunned after almost a year of backroom diplomacy to blunt a bonus crackdown pushed by the European Parliament. France is now backing the parliament's demand for strict limits on bonuses that exceed salary, and a clear majority -- which now crucially includes Germany -- want to compromise so the bonus dispute does not hold up reforms of bank capital rules. This hardening of opinion is enabling Ireland, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, to press the three UK-led holdouts to agree terms it can offer parliament on Tuesday.  Night had fallen. Some 20 airplane passengers had taken their seats for the short hop from Brussels, Belgium, to Zurich, Switzerland. Unknown to them, a precious cargo was being loaded into the airplane hold along with their suitcases: $50 million in rough and polished diamonds. But the diamonds would never reach their final destination.
