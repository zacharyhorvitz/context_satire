In 1993, Elizabeth Crow was appointed editor-in-chief of the magazine. The November 2001 magazine was the final issue. Some of the 93 employees and features moved over to Glamour, also published by Condé Nast. The magazine's demise was due to multiple factors, including an editorial inability to update the magazine to appeal to a sufficient audience and an overall decline in advertising revenues across the magazine industry. Also in 2006, they launched their own underwear range; "Trinny and Susannah Magic Knickers" which are made of nylon, designed to flatten the tummy and buttocks and thighs so they appear slimmer and compact. On 16 October 2006, they appeared on NBC's The Today Show, giving makeovers to three women and promoted their book, Trinny & Susannah Take on America. In a poll of 3,000 people conducted by Radio Times, they were ranked as the ninth most terrifying celebrities on television, largely due to their use of direct and frank advice. In the sixties, Mademoiselle magazine was geared “to the smart young woman”. They categorically stated in their editorials that despite their young, maidenly name they were not geared to young teenagers. The majority of their readers may have been in college, in a job, some may have been married. Mademoiselle was interested in reaching mature college freshmen and up, who were being exposed to the greatest literature, facing the greatest moral problems coping with all the complexities of the atomic age.
