As Mac and Neeta try to escape from the destroyed Hollyoaks High, Neeta falls in a hole after talking to Mac about where it went wrong and why Hunter is the one for her. As she hangs for her life with Mac holding unto her, desperately trying to save her, Hunter shouts "I love you," to Neeta to which she replies "I Love You Too." This angers Mac, causing him to let go of Neeta. This results in the character plummeting to her death. Also, Koko referred to herself as a "queen" at times even though Patterson rarely used this word with Koko. Many researches have speculated that Koko was projecting her awareness that she was famous because of all the attention she received from her care-givers, professors, the media and her fans. Koko was born on July 4, 1971, at the San Francisco Zoo to her biological mother Jacqueline and father Bwana. Koko was the 50th gorilla born in captivity and one of the first gorillas accepted by her mother in captivity. Koko remained with her mother until the age of one when she was taken to the zoo's hospital to be treated for a life-threatening illness. Patterson originally cared for Koko at the San Francisco Zoo as part of her doctoral research at Stanford University after Koko came to the zoo's hospital.
