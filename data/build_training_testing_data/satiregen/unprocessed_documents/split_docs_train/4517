 Donald Trump has never been shy about talking up his close business relationships with the Saudis. "I get along great with all of them," Trump said of the Saudis at a 2015 campaign rally in Mobile, Alabama. "They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million.  President Donald Trump claimed on Tuesday to have "no financial interests in Saudi Arabia." Yet in his own telling, he has reaped plenty of benefits from the massively wealthy Saudi royal family. Seeking to rebut claims his own ties to the Kingdom may be clouding his assessment of Riyadh's involvement in the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump tweeted Tuesday morning: "For the record, I have no financial interests in Saudi Arabia (or Russia, for that matter). Any suggestion that I have is just more FAKE NEWS (of which there is plenty)!"  President Donald Trump said he is not giving cover to Saudi Arabia over the suspected killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as his top diplomat said Riyadh needed space and time to conduct an investigation. But as details continue to emerge about Khashoggi's suspected murder inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 -- and sources float the possibility that blame will fall on a "rogue" operative -- the administration's effort to defend Saudi Arabia is creating pushback and raising questions about Trump's potential conflicts of interest. Some lawmakers are calling for an independent international inquiry as others are asking the President to report to Congress within a month about any personal financial ties he might have to the Kingdom that might create conflicts of interest. "According to public reports, the Trump Organization for decades has maintained business relationships with the government of Saudi Arabia and members of the Saudi royal family," a group of Democratic senators wrote the President on Wednesday.
