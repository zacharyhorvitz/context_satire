 Former President Barack Obama is adding his voice to the Alabama Senate race, imploring voters to go to the polls Tuesday to reject the candidacy of Roy Moore as part of an aggressive effort by Democrats to try and counter President Donald Trump's full-throated endorsement of the controversial Republican candidate. "This one's serious," Obama says in the call. "You can't sit it out." Two Democratic officials familiar with the Alabama race tell CNN that Obama recorded the phone message in recent days, at the very time Trump stepped up his own involvement in the campaign with a recorded message.  Former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is calling on Alabama voters to take part in Tuesday's special election for the US Senate, dubbing the race "one of the most significant in Alabama's history," according to AL.com. "This week's special election will be one of the most significant in Alabama's history. As a native daughter, I remain -- at heart -- an Alabaman who loves our state and its devotion to faith, family, and country," Rice said in a statement, recalling her Alabama roots. Republican Roy Moore will face off against Democrat Doug Jones in the special election to fill the seat that Republican Jeff Sessions occupied before he left last winter to become US attorney general.  President Donald Trump invited Democratic Senator-elect Doug Jones to the White House in a congratulatory phone call, Jones said Wednesday. Jones, elected Tuesday to be a US senator from Alabama after defeating Republican Roy Moore, said it was "a very gracious call," from the President and that he "very much appreciated it." "He congratulated me and my staff on the way and the matter in which we handled this campaign and went forward," Jones said. "And we talked about finding that common ground to work together, and he invited me over to the White House to visit just as soon as I get up there."
