 The sheer size and wildness of Yellowstone National Park's signature bison provide a magnificent subject for camera-toting tourists. But officials caution visitors not to come within 25 yards of the animals, noting that they are unpredictable and able to sprint three times faster than people can run. A 62-year-old Australian man who ventured to within 3 to 5 feet of one bison was injured Tuesday when the animal charged and tossed him into the air several times, park officials said. He was released from a hospital later in the evening.  A photo has emerged showing the lioness that mauled American tourist Katherine Chappell moments before the deadly attack. In the photo, the wild cat's huge paws are clamped onto the side of the white safari Jeep in which Chappell was a passenger. Almost as tall as the Jeep on her hind legs, she appears to be forcing her muzzle into the back window. Chappell, 29, was taking photos of a pride last week at Lion Park in South Africa's Gauteng province when one of the animals leaped up against the vehicle and fatally attacked her, according to accounts of the attack.  Katherine Chappell went to South Africa on a volunteer mission to protect wildlife. But as the 29-year-old American was taking photos of a pride of lions at a safari park on Monday, one of them leaped up against the vehicle she was in and fatally attacked her, according to accounts of the incident. Her family is heartbroken. "Katie was a brilliant, kind, adventurous and high-spirited woman," a family member said in a Facebook post.
