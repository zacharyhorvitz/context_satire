 Donald Trump will become the 45th president of the United States, CNN projects, a historic victory for outsiders that represents a stunning repudiation of Washington's political establishment. The billionaire real estate magnate and former reality star needed an almost perfect run through the swing states -- and he got it, winning Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. The Republican swept to victory over Hillary Clinton in the ultimate triumph for a campaign that repeatedly shattered the conventions of politics to pull off a remarkable upset. Clinton conceded to Trump in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Paul Ryan, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, was initially critical of Trump on multiple occasions. In December 2015 when Trump called for a ban on foreign Muslims entering the country, Ryan said "What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for, and more importantly, it's not what this country stands for." Even after endorsing Trump, Ryan continued to criticize Trump's religion-based immigration proposals. In early March 2016 Ryan condemned Trump's failure to repudiate the support of white supremacists, and in mid March he strongly objected to Trump's suggestion that there could be "riots" at the Republican convention if he is not the nominee.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Wednesday even though she "didn't want to see Donald Trump win," the Massachusetts Democrat and "those of us who supported Hillary Clinton will respect this result." In a statement, Warren brought up a focal point of Trump's campaign: his promise to rebuild the economy as an area for collaboration. "President-elect Trump promised to rebuild our economy for working people, and I offer to put aside our differences and work with him on that task," she wrote. "But the integrity of our democracy is more important than any individual election," Sen. Warren said, echoing President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's remarks from earlier today.
