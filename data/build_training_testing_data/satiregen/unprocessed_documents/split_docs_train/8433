In November 2014, three top leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints attended the Vatican's "Humanum: An International Interreligious Colloquium on the Complementarity of Man and Woman"; the presiding bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Gérald Caussé, the First Counselor in the First Presidency of the Church Henry B. Eyring, and L. Tom Perry, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Catholic leaders and leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reaffirmed their shared beliefs in the centrality of marriage and families in society. Pope Francis shook hands with Henry B. Eyring, who was one of the 30 speakers chosen for the event. The interaction was the first time a Pope and a leader from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had met face-to-face.  Pope Francis celebrated Mass Thursday before a huge gathering of young Catholics in Krakow on the 1,050th anniversary of Poland's "baptism" as a Catholic country. Scattered showers did little to deter the hundreds of thousands of cheering worshipers, who gathered in Krakow's Blonia Park to hear the Pope deliver the open-air Mass. Francis is making his first visit to the predominantly Catholic Eastern European country for World Youth Day -- an event organized by the church that draws young Catholics on pilgrimages from around the world every two or three years. "Nothing is more beautiful than seeing the enthusiasm, dedication, zeal and energy with which so many young people live," he told the crowds during Thursday's welcoming sermon for the event. One morning in February 1208, Francis was hearing Mass in the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels, near which he had then built himself a hut. The Gospel of the day was the "Commissioning of the Twelve" from the Book of Matthew. The disciples are to go and proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand. Francis was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty.
