Moulton had considered running against Democratic Representative John F. Tierney of Massachusetts's 6th congressional district as an Independent in the 2012 elections, but he decided against it in July 2012, saying that "the time and the logistics of putting together all the campaign infrastructure, organizing the volunteers ... the fundraisingâ€”it's just too much to accomplish in three months." Had he run and been elected, he would have caucused with the Democrats. He told Roll Call that his own polling "showed there was in fact a clear path to victory" and said he might run for office in the future. In his early 20s in an article in the U.K.'s Gay Times, Evans stated that people would approach him in gay pubs to tell him that they could not believe that he was gay. In a consequent 2002 interview in The Advocate in the U.S. he said that although his (then) part (in Taboo) was that of a straight man "everybody knew me as a gay man, and in my life in London I never tried to hide it". Isbell has stated on the importance of his northern Alabama roots: "I definitely don't feel like I would be the musician that I am, or the type of songwriter, had I not come from that particular place," he says now. "The soul music that came out of there, and a lot of the soul-influenced rock and roll and country music that came out of the studios in north Alabama in the 1960s and 1970s had a big influence on me." Isbell said that working at FAME Studios was everything to him, that it was a gateway towards the music that he wanted to play. In addition to citing Neil Young as a big influence, Isbell is a fan of singer-songwriter Ben Howard and guitarist Blake Mills.
