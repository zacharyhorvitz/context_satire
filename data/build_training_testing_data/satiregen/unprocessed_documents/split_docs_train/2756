 If Anne Frank had not died a teenager in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, Justin Bieber hopes she would have been his devoted fan. That's what Bieber, 19, wrote in the guestbook at the Anne Frank House when he visited there Friday, according to the Amsterdam site. "Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl.  While his comment about Anne Frank drew criticism from around the world, pop star Justin Bieber and his camp have remained silent on the issue -- and plan to keep it that way. There will be no official statement from Bieber or his representatives, a source close to the star told CNN on Monday. Bieber did not mention it to his millions of followers on Twitter and Facebook. The controversy stems from the 19-year-old's visit to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on Friday. "Boyfriend" has received mixed reviews. Andrew Hampp of Billboard rated it 82 out of 100, stating that Bieber sounds more adult than ever, but noted that most of his fans are still 12-year-old girls. Amy Sciaretto of Pop Crush praised the track, and said that the result of trying new music styles resulted on "a more mature, more well-rounded Justin Bieber song." Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV said that "Boyfriend" is "crazy dope", and realized that the lyrics are directed to the things Bieber does with his current girlfriend Selena Gomez.
