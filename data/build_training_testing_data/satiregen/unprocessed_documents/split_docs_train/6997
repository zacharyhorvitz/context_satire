 It's time for the reality star to show he's ready for prime time. The Republican National Convention in Cleveland, culminating in the party nominee's key note address on Thursday night, will require a set of political multi-tasking skills far beyond those so far demonstrated by Donald Trump. The high stakes political jamboree should begin to answer a fundamental question of the 2016 election: whether a campaign anchored almost exclusively on Trump's hulking public persona and dominant ego can perform as well on the national stage as in the rough and tumble of Republican primary politics. "Can he move himself from being primary candidate who sometimes comes across as the host of a reality TV to show himself as a possible President of the United States?"  Former President George W. Bush fretted to a group of former aides and advisers in April that he was worried he could be the "last Republican president." The 43rd president's remark, at a gathering in Dallas of his administration's staffers, reflected a dim view of the party's prospects at a time when the primary contest was realistically down to Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. "I'm worried that I will be the last Republican president," Bush told a clutch of former aides and advisers. The comment was reported by Politico. The U.S. Taxpayers Party had run its first presidential ticket in 1992, it being head by Howard Phillips who had failed to find any prominent conservative willing to take the mantle. In 1996 the situation ultimately proved the same, though Pat Buchanan for a time was widely speculated to be planning on bolting to the Taxpayers' Party should the expected Republican nominee, Senator Bob Dole, name a Pro-Choice running-mate. When Jack Kemp, who is Pro-Life, was tapped for the position Buchanan agreed to endorse the Republican ticket. Again, Phillips found himself at a temporary post that was made permanent, with Herbert Titus being nominated for the Vice Presidency.
