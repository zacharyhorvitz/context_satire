On January 20, 2008, Green Bay appeared in their first NFC Championship Game in 10 years facing the New York Giants in Green Bay. The game was lost 23–20 on an overtime field goal by Lawrence Tynes. This would be Brett Favre's final game as a Green Bay Packer with his final pass being an interception in overtime. In Week 9, the Packers returned home for another Sunday Night game, this time with the struggling 1-7 Cowboys. Green Bay quickly marched out to two touchdowns in the first quarter, en route to a 45-7 crushing of their opponent. Following their bye week, the Packers headed to Minnesota for a rematch with the Vikings, who virtually laid down in much the same manner as Dallas. Green Bay quickly buried them 31-3, causing their head coach, Brad Childress, to be fired. After winning against the New York Jets for the first time in the New York Area, the Green Bay Packers took on the lowly Dallas Cowboys. After a scoreless first quarter, the Packers offense that was limited to 9 points against the New York Jets, built a 28–0 lead before the Cowboys scored their only touchdown before the end of the first half. The Packers would score 17 more points in the second half before closing the game out 45–7 over the Dallas Cowboys. The Green Bay Packers intercepted Jon Kitna 3 times including one to Clay Matthews which would result in 62-yard touchdown, while Aaron Rodgers threw for 3 touchdowns.
