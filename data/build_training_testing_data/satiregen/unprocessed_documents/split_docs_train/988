In 2018, the Center for Investigative Reporting published evidence that the Cardinal Bea House, owned by the Jesuit order and located on Gonzaga's campus, was used by the Catholic Church as a retirement home for priests with histories of sexual predation and abuse from across the pacific northwest and Alaska, from the 1970s through 2016. Sexually abusive priests were quietly kept there and out of contact with vulnerable populations, while at the same time protecting the priests from any liability for the abuses they had committed. The last abusive priest moved out of the Cardinal Bea House in 2016.

As the first-born son, he was in line to inherit his father's title and status of Marquis. His father assumed that Aloysius would become a soldier, as that was the norm for sons of the aristocracy and the family was often involved in the minor wars of the period.

As early as age four, Luigi was given a set of miniature guns and accompanied his father on training expeditions so that the boy might learn "the art of arms".
