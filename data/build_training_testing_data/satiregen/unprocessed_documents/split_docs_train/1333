Portland is a settlement in Newfoundland and Labrador. Portland is located on Route 234, between Brooklyn and Jamestown, on the east side of Goose Bay, Bonavista Bay. Settled in the 1870's, it takes its name from a white rock, visible from the bay, making it look similar to Portland, England. The area was originally used for winter forestry work and for schooner building as well as some lobster fishing and agriculture. Portland is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Maine and the seat of Cumberland County. Portland's population was 66,417 as of 2018. The Greater Portland metropolitan area is home to over half a million people, more than one-third of Maine's total population, making it the most populous metropolitan area in northern New England (an area comprising the states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont) and the 106th-largest in the United States. Portland's economy relies mostly on the service sector and tourism. The Portland Canal is an arm of Portland Inlet, one of the principal inlets of the British Columbia Coast. It is approximately 114 kilometres (71 mi) long. The Portland Canal forms part of the border between southeastern Alaska and British Columbia. The name of the entire inlet in the Nisga'a language is K'alii Xk'alaan, with /xk/alaan/ meaning "at the back of (someplace)".
