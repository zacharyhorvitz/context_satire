Walk Through Fire is the debut album by Yola. It was released on February 22, 2019 on Dan Auerbach's Easy Eye Sound label, to much acclaim. The album title references both a fire which damaged Yola's home and an abusive relationship from which she escaped. AllMusic called the album "an extraordinary record, one designed to be part of a grand musical tradition, and it contains enough emotion and imagination to earn its place within that lineage."
