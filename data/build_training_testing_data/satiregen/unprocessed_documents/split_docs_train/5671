 The US is facing a major heat wave in the coming days, with two-thirds of the country at risk. The Northeast and Midwest are expected to be hit the hardest, with the heat index expected to reach nearly 115 degrees in some parts of the country. Officials in the affected areas are warning people to stay cool and hydrated, and of course, not to leave children or animals in hot cars. According to the National Safety Council, an average of 38 children die every year after being left in hot cars.  While many Americans along the Gulf Coast are bracing for torrential rain and a possible hurricane, millions of others are dreading the oppressive heat to come in the next few days. More than 6.5 million people are under an excessive heat warning, including residents of Phoenix, according to the National Weather Service. Above normal temperatures in the Arizona capital could factor into heat indexes close to 120 degrees on Friday and Saturday, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. On Wednesday the temperature alone was headed toward 110 degrees and Thursday will be hotter, the weather service said.  Nearly half of the US population will see temperatures of at least 95 degrees over the next seven days, according to meteorologists. More than 70 million people are under heat watches, warnings or advisories in different parts of the country, including the Midwest, the National Weather Service said Tuesday. "Temperatures in the mid-90s to 100 degrees sounds bad, but the most significant aspect of the heat wave will be the overnight temperatures," CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. "Low temperatures from the Midwest to the Northeast will be in mid- to upper 70s.
