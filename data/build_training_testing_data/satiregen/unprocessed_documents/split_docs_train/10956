 The Panda and her cub have gone dark. The government shutdown has claimed one of its most beloved casualties: the National Zoo's panda cam. But animal lovers can rest assured that the zoo's endangered Giant Pandas -- Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and an unnamed newborn cub -- will still be fed and cared for, the zoo said. The Smithsonian Institution was required to shutter many non-essential programs during the shutdown, including the Washington, D.C., zoo and its museums, because it receives federal funding.  Congress failed to pass a funding bill on Monday night. And so began a series of complex procedures to power down the federal government. Many parts of the government technically shut down as the clock struck midnight and the new fiscal year began without a budget. But the actual powering down of the government's sprawling business won't start in earnest until Tuesday morning when offices are scheduled to open.  Furloughed workers. Shuttered offices. Lost pay. By now, we know well the awful mess we're in  due to the government grinding to a halt.
