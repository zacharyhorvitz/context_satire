The carpet of the Oval Office bears the Seal of the President. President Harry S. Truman's oval carpet was the first to incorporate the presidential seal. In Truman's carpet, the seal was represented monochromatically through varying depths of the cut pile. His carpet was used in the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. Traditionally, the addresses are delivered with the President sitting at the Resolute desk speaking into the camera. Occasionally, however, the President will stand at a lectern on the opposite side of the Oval Office and give the address. Previously, it was also common for an artificial background to be placed behind the President, ordinarily consisting of plain blue fabric. Since the administration of Jimmy Carter, the preference has instead been for the natural backdrop of the Office's windows.  President Barack Obama and Cuban President Ra√∫l Castro spoke on the phone Friday to discuss the process of normalizing relations between the two countries. The conversation came one day before Pope Francis is scheduled to arrive in Cuba before heading to the United States, where he will meet with Obama. According to the White House, the two leaders commended the Pope for his role in helping advance relations between the countries, which had been at odds for more than 50 years. Obama and Castro also discussed the importance of reopening embassies in Washington and Havana, as well as recognized that they will continue to have differences as they move forward, which they intend to address "candidly."
