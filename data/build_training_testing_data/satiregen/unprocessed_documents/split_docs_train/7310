The Phineas Priesthood is not considered an organization because it is not led by a governing body, its members do not hold gatherings, and it does not have a membership process. One simply becomes a Phineas Priest by adopting the Priesthood's beliefs and acting upon them. Adherents of the Phineas Priesthood ideology are considered terrorists because among other things, their crimes include numerous abortion clinic bombings in 1996, the 1996 bombing of The Spokesman-Review newspaper in Spokane, Washington, bank robberies, and plans to blow up FBI buildings. Four men who professed to follow the "religious philosophy of Phineas priests" were convicted of crimes that included bank robbery and bombings and each of them was sentenced to life in prison in 1997 and 1998. Twe emerged as an opposition to challenge the Presidency of Tubman and postulated that it was the responsibility of the United States of America to conduct free and fair elections in Liberia. He was disqualified on charges of sedition subsequently. Tubman canvassed with a theme of anti-communism and announced in an election rally that "it might be well that they endeavor to work out their own salvation and with fear and trembling". The Speaker of the House also drew examples from the US on the need to suppress Communism. The Phineas Priests are not an organization and they have no discernible leadership or institutional structure. For ideological adherents a "Phineas Priest" is someone who commits a "Phineas action" - this means they follow the example of Phineas, a Hebrew man who, according to the Old Testament, was rewarded by God for killing an interfaith couple. The term "Phineas action" is more broadly used by white supremacists, not only for murders of interracial couples, but also for attacks on Jewish people, other non-white ethnic groups, "multiculturalists" and anyone they see as their enemies.
