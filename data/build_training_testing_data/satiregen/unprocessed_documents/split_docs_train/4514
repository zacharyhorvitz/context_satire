Children in Missouri between the ages of five and seven are not required to be enrolled in school. However, if they are enrolled in a public school their parent, guardian or custodian must ensure that they regularly attend. The student-run newspaper at Missouri S&T, The Missouri Miner, is published every Thursday during the school year and can be read online. In February 2007, the paper threatened to sue the school because the university cut funding. After a one-school-year break for many reasons including a funding cut, The Missouri Miner continued publication in the fall semester of 2009. In 2012, the school conducted studies on whether to rename the school back to the University of Kansas City (but still remaining in the University of Missouri system). In November 2012, the school decided against the change noting at the time, "while prospective students and the community at large had strong interest in the name change, several other important groups — current students, faculty/staff, and alumni — do not favor a name change at this time."
