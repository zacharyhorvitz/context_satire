Time Honoured Ghosts is a 1975 album released by the English rock group, Barclay James Harvest. The title was suggested by the wife of Harvey Lisberg, the band's manager at the time, though it is believed that she was quoting from another unknown source. It was recorded between May and July 1975 at the "His Masters Wheels" studio in San Francisco. It was produced by Elliot Mazer and released in October on the Polydor Records label. After this album, they departed from EMI, moved management to Harvey Lisberg, and signed to Polydor, the move immediately resulting in greater sales. The next album, Everyone Is Everybody Else (1974), is viewed by many as their artistic high point. This was shown by the album being played extensively on Radio Caroline, and by its appearance in the station's Top 100 All Time Albums Chart. It also led to the band being invited to a BBC Radio 1 session for John Peel; Alan Freeman, however, would be the band's main champion on the station in the 1970s and again when he returned from 1989-93. In 1998, musical differences amongst members of BJH saw the band essentially split into two different groups, each of which retained "Barclay James Harvest" as part of its name. John Lees released an album mixing new songs and classics of the band, entitled Nexus, under the name "Barclay James Harvest Through the Eyes of John Lees". Woolly Wolstenholme played in (and composed for) this band, subsequently resurrecting Maestoso to record and tour with new material, as well as back-catalogue favourites. Les Holroyd and Mel Pritchard teamed up to record under the name "Barclay James Harvest featuring Les Holroyd".
