Thomerson has had many memorable roles in feature films, including Uncommon Valor, Air America, Volunteers, Who's Harry Crumb?, Iron Eagle, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, just to name a few, as well as numerous television roles such as Tour of Duty and 21 Jump Street. He also played Colonel Savage of the Missouri Militia on The Young Riders in 1989. In the '90s he was a series regular on the television police drama Sirens followed by a regular, co-starring role on the series Land's End starring Fred Dryer. One of Thomerson's early acting breaks came from director Robert Altman who, after seeing Thomerson's stand-up act, cast him in the film A Wedding. At this early stage of Thomerson's movie career he found himself surrounded by the likes of Vittorio Gassman, Carol Burnett, Geraldine Chaplin, and a very young Dennis Franz. In 1985, Thomerson starred as the time-traveling future cop Jack Deth in the low budget science fiction film Trancers which was produced by Charles Band and Empire Pictures. The role made him an icon of the B-movie genre, and led to Thomerson building a working relationship with the Bands. He was supposed to appear in Pulse Pounders which was ultimately never completed.
