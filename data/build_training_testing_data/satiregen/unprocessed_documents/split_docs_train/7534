While no crime was committed at that point—after all he could claim he was just browsing—the fact that he was in almost every aisle she was in and seemed to be looking at her, or at least in her direction, was too much of a coincidence for the police to ignore. Moreover, the man was wearing clothing similar to the figure seen in the Macy's video. When the video still of the man was released to the media, it generated hundreds of tips but they were too general to be useful. The detectives reasoned that if she were deliberately singled out for abduction, then her stalker must have been in the store watching her. Going back to the security cameras they noticed that a male figure, who was white and in his early twenties, seemed to be in every aisle and in almost every part of the footage showing Kelsey — but at a discreet distance. Investigators also noticed he was wearing a white shirt and dark shorts. When they looked at the video of her entering they saw him coming in about thirty seconds later. In at least one instance, the law was acted upon, when a thief stole a car with a baby inside. In February 2015, in Lenexa, not far from where Kelsey Smith grew up, the man stole the car, unaware of the five-month-old infant in the carseat. While in flight, he also ran down a pedestrian in a hit-and-run. The police found the car a half-hour later at a convenience store after having pinged the mother's cell phone which was still in a purse on the front seat.
