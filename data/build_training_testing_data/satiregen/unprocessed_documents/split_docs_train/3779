 The United States sent a warship very close to one of China's artificial islands in the South China Sea on Tuesday, a potential challenge to Beijing's territorial claims in the contested waters. A U.S. defense official told CNN that the destroyer USS Lassen "conducted a transit" within 12 nautical miles of Subi Reef in the Spratly Islands on Tuesday morning local time. The operation put the ship within an area that would be considered Chinese sovereign territory if the U.S. recognized the man-made islands as being Chinese territory, the official added. The mission, which had the approval of President Barack Obama, has now concluded, the official said.  Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed both houses of the British Parliament on Tuesday afternoon as he and his wife began a four-day visit that has aroused concern among human rights activists. Xi called the British Parliament "the mother of all parliaments." The visit is designed to strengthen economic ties between Britain and China -- including Chinese investment in the UK and commercial ties between the two countries. The rhetoric in advance of the meeting has been warm.  Chinese government hackers have attempted to steal the secret sauce that makes American tech and drug companies tick, according to a prominent cybersecurity company. Determining who is behind an attack is an extremely tricky business, since hackers can easily mask their locations. But cyber firm Crowdstrike said in a blog post Monday that several factors, including the hackers' signature computer code, indicated that they were Chinese government-sponsored hackers. "The infrastructure and the exact tools they use match previous Chinese government-sponsored actors," said Dmitri Alperovitch, Crowdstrike's chief technology officer.
