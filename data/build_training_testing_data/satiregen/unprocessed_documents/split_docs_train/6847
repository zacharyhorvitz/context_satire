 The shooting in San Bruno, California, at YouTube's headquarters was, in   some respects, just another case of gun violence. Three people were shot before the woman turned the handgun on herself and committed suicide. Employees were seen fleeing off the YouTube campus as police rushed to the scene. It appears, by news accounts now, that the shooter was Nasim Najafi Aghdam.  Family members of the woman who opened fire at YouTube's headquarters this week were stunned by news of the attack in San Bruno, California, but said they warned police ahead of the shooting. Nasim Najafi Aghdam was upset with some of YouTube's policies, according to San Bruno police Chief Ed Barberini, motivating her to shoot and wound three people before killing herself. Aghdam used YouTube to post videos about her views on animal rights and her vegan lifestyle, among other topics. "Our family is in absolute shock and can't make sense of what has happened (Tuesday)," Aghdam's father said in a statement to CNN affiliate KTLA.  The YouTube headquarters where a female shooter wounded three people with a handgun before apparently taking her own life has more than 1,100 workers and is located in San Bruno, about 13 miles south of San Francisco. Employees there include engineers working on site search, content channels and ad products, according to a website for Google, YouTube's parent company. The workforce also includes sales teams that work with advertisers and content creators who develop programming, the Google website says. "An open, airy space makes collaboration a breeze and encourages innovation," the website says in describing the headquarters, which includes a basketball court and a lap pool.
