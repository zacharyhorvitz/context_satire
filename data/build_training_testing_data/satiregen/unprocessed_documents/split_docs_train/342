The Camden markets are a number of adjoining large retail markets, often collectively referred to as "Camden Market" or "Camden Lock", located in the historic former Pickfords stables, in Camden Town, London. It is situated north of the Hampstead Road Lock of the Regent's Canal (popularly referred to as Camden Lock). Famed for their cosmopolitan image, products sold on the stalls include crafts, clothing, bric-a-brac, and fast food. It is the fourth-most popular visitor attraction in London, attracting approximately 250,000 people each week.A small local foodstuffs market has operated in Inverness Street in Camden Town since the beginning of the 20th century. In 1985 15 year old King Robbo painted a graffiti work under the British Transport Police Headquarters on a wall beside Regent's Canal in Camden, London which was only accessible by water. A large full colour graffiti piece, called "Robbo Incorporated", it had over the years become the oldest piece of graffiti in London. Over time, virtually all of his works had been gradually removed from London's trains and walls by authorities, except for this  piece. In 2009 however, the English stencil artist Banksy destroyed most of it with a stencil of a workman pasting wallpaper. Thierry Guetta, best known by his moniker Mr. Brainwash, is a French-born, Los Angeles-based  street artist. According to the 2010 Banksy-directed film Exit Through the Gift Shop, Guetta was a proprietor of a used clothing store, and amateur videographer who was first introduced to street art by his cousin, the street artist Invader, and who filmed street artists through the 2000s and became an artist in his own right in a matter of weeks after an off-hand suggestion from Banksy.
