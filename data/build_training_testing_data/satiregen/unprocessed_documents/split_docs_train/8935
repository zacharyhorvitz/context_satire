On March 20, 2015 drummer A. J. Pero died in his sleep of a heart attack. Twisted Sister released the following statement: "The members of Twisted Sister are profoundly saddened to announce the untimely passing of our brother, AJ Pero. The band, crew and most importantly the family of AJ Pero thank you for your thoughts and prayers at this time." Shortly thereafter, Adrenaline Mob, who also featured Pero on drums, released a statement revealing that Pero had died while sleeping on the band's tour bus. Twisted Sister was an American heavy metal band originally from Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey, and later based in Long Island, New York. Twisted Sister's best-known hits include "We're Not Gonna Take It" from the movie Gung Ho and "I Wanna Rock", which had music videos noted for their sense of slapstick humor. Although the band is sometimes regarded as glam metal due to its use of makeup, frontman Dee Snider considers the term to be inappropriate. Twisted Sister are also ranked No. After the success of Stay Hungry, Twisted Sister were faced with the question whether they should continue in a more pop-oriented direction or return to their early heavy metal roots. They tried to do a bit of both, but the approach proved unsuccessful since Come Out and Play marked the start of the band's decline. According to an interview with lead singer and songwriter Dee Snider, found in the CD sleeve of Club Daze 1: The Studio Sessions, The Shangri-Las cover "Leader of the Pack", which was first included on the early EP Ruff Cuts (1982), was intended to boost the band's popularity while keeping old fans pleased. Eventually neither that nor "Be Chrool To Your Scuel", featuring such musical guests as Alice Cooper, Brian Setzer, Clarence Clemons and Billy Joel among many others, received the reaction that the band and their record label were expecting.
