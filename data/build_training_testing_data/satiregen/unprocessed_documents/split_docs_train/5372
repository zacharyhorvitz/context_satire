The Department of Education publishes the New Jersey School Report Card as part of an effort to increase school- and district-level accountability for educational progress by providing relevant data to the public that can be used to monitor and measure the performance of schools. While the format and contents of the reports have changed over time, the New Jersey School Report Card has offered the public information about each and every New Jersey school since 1995 when the Legislature enacted the reporting requirement. A charter school is a public school that functions as its own Local Education Agency (LEA) if allowed a charter by the Commissioner of Education. The ability to approve a charter school program lies with the Commissioner of Education due to the Charter School Program Act of 1995. The New Jersey Department of Education is the only institution with the authority to sanction charter schools. In order to open a charter school, one must fill out an application, which can be found on the NJ DOE website. The department is currently led by the Secretary of Education, nominated by the President of the Philippines and confirmed by the Commission on Appointments. The Secretary is a member of the Cabinet. The current Secretary of Education is Leonor Briones. Presently, its mission is to provide quality basic education that is equitably accessible to all and lay the foundation for lifelong learning and service for the common good.
