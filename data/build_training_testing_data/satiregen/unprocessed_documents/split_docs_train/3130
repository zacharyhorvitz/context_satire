Wayne Davis (Gary Cole) is a police officer, Katherine's first husband, and the father of the "real" Dylan. It is shown in flashbacks that he beat his wife and also had a drinking problem, causing Katherine to leave him. He spent twelve years trying to track Katherine and his daughter down and discovered Katherine is back on Wisteria Lane. He wanted a relationship with his daughter, or who he thought to be his daughter, until Katherine informed him that Dylan is not his child. Dylan Mayfair (Lyndsy Fonseca) is Katherine's daughter. Dylan has no memory of "her" early years, and throughout Season 4, she unearths surprising news about her past, including her unknown friendship with Julie Mayer, whom she had never actually met since it was Katherine's original daughter, Dylan Davis, who was Julie's friend. One day, Dylan is driving, and a police officer pulls her over for speeding. Later, she finds out he is her father, Wayne, who she always thought had died. Depp stated to the German magazine Stern in 2003 that "America is dumb, is something like a dumb puppy that has big teethâ€”that can bite and hurt you, aggressive." Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and his words were taken out of context, Stern stood by its story, as did CNN.com in its coverage of the interview. CNN added his remark that he would like his children "to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out."
