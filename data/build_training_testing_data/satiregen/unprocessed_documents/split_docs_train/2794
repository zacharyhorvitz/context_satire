 There were 17 Republican candidates here tonight, but the first GOP presidential debate of the 2016 season overwhelmingly revolved around one man: Donald Trump. The billionaire real estate mogul delivered an unforgettably explosive performance Thursday night. He repeatedly attacked his rivals on stage, jousted with the moderators, drew jeers and laughter from the audience with his typically colorful language and, true to form, refused to apologize for anything. The nine candidates flanking Trump at the prime-time debate appeared emboldened at times by Trump's bluster and, at other moments, amused by the conduct of the GOP's current frontrunner.  The top 10 candidates for the Republican presidential nomination only had a few minutes each on Thursday to capture the attention of voters tuning in to the first big-league Republican presidential debate. Donald Trump may have grabbed the most headlines from the night, but the prime-time debate didn't yield a clear victor. The night did offer a few breakout stars, and no candidate seemed to have sunk their campaign by the end of the night. CNN fact checks the 2016 Republican debates From the stand-out moments to the blows, here are the night's top eight takeaways: 1. The Commission on Presidential Debates selected Chris Wallace as moderator of the third presidential debate, held on October 19, 2016, at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. This was the first time a Fox News anchor had moderated a general election presidential debate. After he was selected, Wallace controversially said, "it's not my job" to fact-check candidates, but that it was the job of the opposing candidate. After the debate, Jennifer Rubin in The Washington Post said that despite her strong disapproval of other Fox News commentators, "No one could watch the final debate and deny that Chris Wallace is among the best in the business."
