At the start of the 20th century there was a concern that Britain was falling behind Germany in scientific and technical education. A departmental committee was set up at the Board of Education in 1904, to look into the future of the Royal College of Science. A report released in 1906 called for the establishment of an institution unifying the Royal College of Science and the Royal School of Mines, as well as – if agreement could be reached with the City and Guilds of London Institute – their Central Technical College. TICAS created the policy model and led the movement for what became the first widely available income-based student loan repayment plan (IBR), which President Bush signed into law in 2007. In addition to being a longtime advocate of Pell grants, the organization also changed the concept of student loans to student debt. The Institute staffs the Project on Student Debt, and produces an annual ￼￼report￼￼ on student debt in the U.S. used by journalists and others needing the most recent data on higher education.
