Alan Gibson came up with the idea for The Flipside of Dominick Hide (1980), a Play for Today he co-wrote with Jeremy Paul and directed. As a child he had overheard his family discussing a recent UFO report and thought to himself: "Since there had been sightings of flying saucers recorded throughout history, it occurred to me that they were man-made machines, time machines from the future".

"The Flipside of Dominick" Hide attained viewing figures of 5.3 million and a reaction index of 75 - compared to an average Play for Today score of 59.
