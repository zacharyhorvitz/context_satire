A year after the end of the last arc, Walker and his new partner Enki Sunrise investigate the murder of Z, whom Walker teamed up with in World War 2. Sunrise continues her covert Internal Affairs-directed investigation of Walker, but slowly becomes more hesitant to inform on him. Walker proposes to his girlfriend Heather, but she is receiving visions detailing a forthcoming apocalyptic battle, and leaves without telling him she is pregnant. Pilgrim returns to Chicago, now a member of the F.B.I. Powers and her family moved to Fairbanks, Alaska, when she was 3 years old. Her parents were archaeologists, with Irish-American heritage. She credits her interest in politics and debate with being "expected to state and defend my positions on the issues of the day every night at dinner". Powers was married to actor Gary Lockwood from 1966 to 1972. She had a relationship with actor William Holden from just after her divorce to just before his death that led to their joint involvement with wildlife conservation. He died in 1981; by the following year, Powers was the founder and president of the William Holden Wildlife Foundation and a director of the Mount Kenya Game Ranch and Wildlife Conservancy in Nanyuki, Kenya. In the United States, she works with both the Cincinnati Zoo and Atlanta Zoo.
