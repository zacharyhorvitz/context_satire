The school's namesake, Lyman, arrived in the area upon the invitation of Congressman Charles Delemere Haines. After Seminole County voted to separate from Orange County, in 1920, the Lymans and other citizens of the area voted to incorporate the city of Altamonte Springs. By 1923, it became apparent that the established school houses in the area did not adequately meet the needs of the growing population. The Lyman Hall Laboratory of Chemistry, which is in the shape of a T, is of brick with limestone trimmings, and is two stories in height, with a full basement. Each floor has an approximate area of 5,600 square feet. The lecture-rooms, stock-rooms, library, offices, gas analysis laboratory, photographic and spectroscopic rooms occupy the front, and the laboratories the rear wing. Especial care has been given to lighting and ventilation, the laboratories being lighted on three sides. Erected in 1905 and named in his honor, The Lyman Hall Laboratory of Chemistry at Georgia Tech is commonly referred to by students as "Lyman Hall" or simply "Lyman", due to the common mistaken impression that the word "Hall" is a mere descriptor. It now houses the Bursar's Office after being completely gutted in 1989, but the quote from geologist Sir Archibald Geikie's 1905 published work remains on the front of the building: "In the first place I would put accuracy."
