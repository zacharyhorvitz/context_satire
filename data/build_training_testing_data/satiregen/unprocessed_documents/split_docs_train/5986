Daniels said she "came from an average, lower-income householdâ€¦ there  days without electricity", and she has described herself as coming from a "really bad neighborhood." During high school, Daniels had a job answering phones at a riding stable. The official name of the corporation was changed to New Valley Corporation in 1991, just in time for that entity to seek bankruptcy protection as part of Amman's strategy to eliminate the overleveraged balance sheet while continuing to grow the money transfer business. The name change was used to shield the Western Union name from being dragged through the proceedings (and the resulting bad PR). Under the day to day leadership of Amman and the backing of LeBow, the company's value increased dramatically through its years operating under chapter 11. In 1914, Daniels took up the post of landscape engineer for Yosemite National Park, where the existing buildings were in poor condition and there were issues with sanitation and water supply. He was tasked with developing a "comprehensive general plan for the development of the floor of the Yosemite Valley". Two months later, he was appointed general superintendent and landscape engineer of all the national parks. He spent the summers of 1914 and 1915 touring parks in the system to understand their problems but kept his private practice going during the winters.
