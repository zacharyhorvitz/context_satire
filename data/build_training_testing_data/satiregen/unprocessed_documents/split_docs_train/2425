In the 2016/2017 season the furthest McManus could progress in an event was at the World Open, where he beat Jamie Cope and Liang Wenbo, but he was thrashed 0–5 by Thepchaiya Un-Nooh. He would also reach the third round in the 2016 Paul Hunter Classic, defeating Andy Hicks and Christopher Keogan, both 4–1, before coming up short against Tom Ford. Shaun John McManus (born 9 February 1976) is a former Australian rules footballer. He is one of the most popular players to ever represent the Fremantle Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL) and is often seen as an icon or favourite son of the club. He has been described as the AFL's uphill skiing champion due to his courage, persistence and resilience in overcoming two knee reconstructions. McManus qualified for the 2016 World Championship with comfortable victories over Michael Wasley, David Morris and Jimmy Robertson. In the first round at the Crucible he defeated his fellow-countryman Stephen Maguire 10–7, before overcoming Ali Carter 13–11 in round two. His quarter-final saw him come from 9–11 down against John Higgins to take the final four frames and win 13–11, setting up his first semi-final appearance at the World Championship since 1993. In that semi-final he lost to Ding Junhui 11–17.
