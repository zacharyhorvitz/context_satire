 For President Donald Trump, a bad defeat is simply a spark for a future fight. The President reacted with characteristic defiance to Congress' repudiation of the national emergency declared in the cause of funding his border wall. "VETO!" he tweeted, promising to crush the insubordination of lawmakers who had tried, where many others had failed, to rein in his quest for power and contempt for constitutional norms.  President Donald Trump and his allies weren't shy about using the specter of impeachment during the 2018 midterm campaign to rally the President's core supporters to the polls. And for their 2020 campaign, they were prepared to use the real thing. With House Democrats newly in the majority and the prospects of impeachment surging, Trump and his political allies -- while certainly not hankering for it --  have eyed the potential political upside: using a Democratic impeachment as a powerful foil to galvanize Republicans in droves to re-elect Trump. Several of the President's political advisers, preparing for a re-election campaign focused on boosting turnout among the President's base of supporters, have looked to the possibility of Trump's impeachment as an opportunity to cast Trump as a victim of Washington politics and overzealous Democrats, three sources close to the White House and the campaign said.
