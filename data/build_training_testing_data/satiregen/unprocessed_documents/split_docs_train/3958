On April 1, 1878, the people of Ocean View and the area around the university campus, together with local farmers, were granted incorporation by the State of California as the Town of Berkeley. The first elected trustees of the town were the slate of Denis Kearney's Workingman's Party, who were particularly favored in the working class area of the former Ocean View, now called "West Berkeley". The area near the university became known for a time as "East Berkeley".  Thanks to climate change, you'll be more likely to get struck by lightning as the years pass, scientists say. Make that 50% more likely for those who are around at the end of the century. "With warming, thunderstorms become more explosive," says University of California Berkeley climate scientist David Romps. He and his colleagues studied 11 climate models to arrive at their calculations, which they published in Friday's issue of the journal Science. The College of California's College Homestead Association planned to raise funds for the new campus by selling off adjacent parcels of land. To this end, they laid out a plat and street grid that became the basis of Berkeley's modern street plan. Their plans fell far short of their desires, and they began a collaboration with the State of California that culminated in 1868 with the creation of the public University of California.
