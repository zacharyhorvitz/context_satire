 Meghan Markle will make a striking feminist statement in her wedding to Prince Harry on Saturday, choosing not to be chaperoned for much of the procession down the aisle of St. George's Chapel, Windsor, CNN has learned. In an unprecedented step for a royal bride in the UK, Markle will walk unescorted down the aisle of the chapel nave, after being met at the West Door by a member of the clergy. She will be accompanied in this first part of the wedding procession only by her bridesmaids and page boys, with the senior church figure walking ahead. Prince Charles will join her when she reaches the Quire, where the main royal guests will be seated.  Prince Harry and his brother, Prince William, pleased throngs of royal fans in Britain as the pair went on the traditional "walkabout" Friday evening, the eve of Harry's wedding to American Meghan Markle. The two brothers made their way down Castle Hill in Windsor, on the western outskirts of London where the wedding will take place, and spent 10 minutes with the crowd, longer than many fans there had expected. Prince Harry appeared relaxed, in a light gray blazer and shirt unbuttoned at the collar. At one point he stopped for a long chat with a young child, and he accepted a soft toy from a well-wisher.  Members of the British Armed Forces took to the streets of Windsor Thursday to rehearse their roles ahead of the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle this weekend. More than 250 members of the Armed Forces will take on ceremonial duties on Saturday, lining the streets of Windsor, providing an escort for the procession and flanking the entrance to St George's Chapel, where the couple will wed. Troops left their barracks at 11 a.m. local time (6 a.m. ET) Thursday, many marching to Windsor Castle to take up their positions inside the grounds.
