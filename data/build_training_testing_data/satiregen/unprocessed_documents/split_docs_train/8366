The 2020 Republican National Convention will be an event in which delegates of the United States Republican Party will select the party's nominees for president and vice president in the 2020 United States presidential election. The convention will be held from August 24 to 27, 2020, at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. By tradition, because Republicans currently hold the White House, their convention will be held after the 2020 Democratic National Convention, which is scheduled for July 13–16. Former White House Director of Management and Administration Marcia Lee Kelly, was named convention president and CEO in April 2019 making her the first Asian-American to do so for either major political party in American history.
