The company's typical self-service vending kiosk combines an interactive touch screen and sign. It uses a robotic disc array system containing a stacked carousel of DVDs and web-linked electronic communications. Kiosks can be located indoors or out and can hold more than 600 DVDs with 70â€“200 titles, updated weekly. The kiosks are built as modules, and in areas with higher sales figures, a second machine can be connected to the first one in order to offer a wider selection. Redbox Automated Retail LLC was initially funded by McDonald's Corporation. Originally the kiosks sold a variety of products under the name Ticktok Easy Shop, however in 2003 McDonald's ended its use of the kiosks for these products. Instead, Gregg Kaplan decided to use the kiosks for DVD rentals. The prices of the first rentals varied, until the company landed on the one dollar per day pricing. Throughout most of 2016, former parent company Outerwall was seeking a buyer based on shareholder input. In early September, Outerwall was sold to Apollo Global Management and its three units (Coinstar, ecoATM and Redbox) were split into individual companies. In late September 2016, Outerwall CFO Galen Smith was announced as the new CEO of Redbox. The company had approximately 40,000 kiosks in the United States as of January 2017.
