In October 2019 he claimed that new evidence, of a telephone call he made, proved he did not murder his family. He believed that a police telephone record, showing that he was elsewhere at the time of the killings, had been unearthed. Jeremy began using his first and middle name professionally in the adult industry, after his grandmother Rose was pestered by people calling her thinking they were contacting him. Rose, listed at that time as R. Hyatt in the phone book, was reportedly pestered at all hours by prospective suitors who'd seen Jeremy in Playgirl. "She had to move out of her apartment for a month," he has said. "My father told me, 'If you want to get into this naked, crazy business, so be it, but if you use the family name again, I'll kill you.'" A group of outside supporters has formed around Bamber, and he has reportedly developed several close relationships with women since his conviction. He defended himself on one occasion from a knife attack by another prisoner by using a broken bottle, and on another received 28 stitches on his neck when attacked while making a telephone call. In 1994 he called a radio station from Long Lartin prison to protest his innocence.
