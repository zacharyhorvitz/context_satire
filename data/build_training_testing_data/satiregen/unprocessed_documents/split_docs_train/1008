In 2017, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency enacted legislation that expanded this nationwide., allowing a particular branded formulation of Sildenafil, Viagra Connect (50Â mg), to be sold over the counter and without a prescription throughout the UK from early 2018. While the sale remains subject to a consultation with a pharmacist, the other restrictions from the trial have been removed, allowing customers over the age of 18 to purchase an unlimited number of pills  The decision was made, in part, to reduce online sales of counterfeit and potentially dangerous erectile dysfunction treatments.
