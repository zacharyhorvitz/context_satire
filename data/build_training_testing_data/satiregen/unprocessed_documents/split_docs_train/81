 Ashley Judd, Salma Hayek and Annabella Sciorra took the stage on Oscar night to deliver a message to Hollywood and beyond: Time's up. The three women are among the more than 60 who have accused the disgraced film producer of sexual assault or harassment that took place over the course of three decades. Weinstein has consistently denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex, but the allegations against him sparked a reckoning in Hollywood that took center stage at the Dolby Theater during Sunday's Academy Awards. The woman stood together and spoke about the #MeToo movement that has swept Hollywood over the past several months and pointed out that this is not an issue that solely affects the movie industry.  There were politics, of course. But it was, for the most part, an Academy Awards ceremony that seemed determined to be as cozy, bland and free of surprises as a stay at a suburban chain hotel (which host Jimmy Kimmel offered -- along with a JetSki -- to winners who kept their acceptance speeches short). It was also an Academy Awards ceremony that was just as determined to let its audiences know that whatever passed for traditional at the Oscars has finally, irrevocably changed. The words, "inclusion" and "diversity" were now as much a part of the ceremony soundtrack as the vintage 1930s pop tunes used to usher in the presenters.  Thirty nine people won Academy Awards on Sunday night. Only six of the winners were women. For all the talk on stage about empowering women and achieving gender equality, the four-hour telecast also illustrated persistent inequality in Hollywood. Several of the night's most-buzzed-about moments were about women saying, in one way or another, "time's up."
