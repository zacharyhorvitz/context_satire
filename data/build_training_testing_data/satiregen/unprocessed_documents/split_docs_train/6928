 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker can't escape the divisive battles with union workers that have defined his tenure as governor -- not even in Iowa. The Republican presidential candidate faced boos and chants of "liar" from dozens of protesters who drove down from Wisconsin as he stumped Monday at the Iowa State Fair Des Moines Register soapbox, and the heated incident devolved into physical altercations between supporters and demonstrators. As the protesters shouted, Walker seized the opportunity to highlight his record as a fighter who faced off against unions in Wisconsin and became the first governor to successfully fight an effort to recall him from office.  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has always been a Washington outsider. Now, as he attempts to turn back a Donald Trump surge among Iowa voters, he's further playing up his outsider status by unloading on Beltway Republicans.

Scott Walker talked tough on immigration Monday, saying he had a "similar" approach to that of real estate mogul Donald Trump but declined to say precisely how he would crackdown if elected president. Walker told Fox News that his immigration plan was "similar" to Trump's -- he said he would support building a wall along the Mexican border -- but would not go so far as to endorse Trump's proposal. "I've laid out a number of important reforms when it comes to immigration early this year, not only about securing the border but enforcing the law," Walker said later at the Iowa State Fair on Monday.
