In December 2004, it was announced that Ferguson would succeed Craig Kilborn on CBS's The Late Late Show. His first show as the regular host aired on 3 January 2005. By May 2008, Ben Alba, an American television historian and an authority on US talk shows, said Ferguson "has already made his mark, taking the TV monologue to new levels with an underlying story. But he is only just starting... In a June 2010 interview, promoting his new show The Kilborn File, Kilborn stated that he left late night television due to his thinking that the late night timeslot was "crowded" and "the formats repetitive" and that he wanted to be part of "the first comedy show at dinner time". Kilborn's last episode of The Late Late Show aired on August 27, 2004. The Scottish-born American comedian Craig Ferguson took over the show on January 3, 2005." In August 2004, he elected not to extend his contract, referring to it as "early retirement". In a 2010 interview with the Los Angeles Times Kilborn said "I didn't leave to do anything else, I left to leave. I achieved my career goals and it wasn't all it was cracked up to be," and adding that he believed the late night timeslot to be "crowded," and "the formats repetitive," and that he wanted to be part of "the first comedy show at dinner time." However, in a 2009 interview with the Television Academy Foundation, The Late Late Show executive producer Peter Lassally indicated that Kilborn left the show "because he didn't get the raise he wanted."
