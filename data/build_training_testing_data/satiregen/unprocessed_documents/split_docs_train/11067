 President Donald Trump, his White House and some of his Republican allies on Capitol Hill have repeatedly sought to undermine Robert Mueller's investigation ever since he was named special counsel in May. Those attacks have also led Trump and some in the GOP to attack the FBI and Department of Justice. Here's a look at all the times Republican lawmakers tried to undermine the Russia investigation. Devin Nunes recused himself, but kept investigating anyway House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes continued to be a powerful force in the House's Russia investigation, despite his promise that he stepped aside as the head of the probe as he came under scrutiny himself from the House Ethics Committee.  When Donald Trump met with James Comey in the Oval Office in January 2017, the President said this to the then-FBI director: "I need loyalty, I expect loyalty." When Trump brought then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe into his office shortly after firing Comey in May, the President reportedly asked McCabe who he had voted for in the 2016 election. When Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with Trump in December 2017, hoping to gain the President's help in beating back document demands from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, Trump had something else on his mind: He asked Rosenstein whether he was "on my team." Comey was fired. At a Republican fundraiser on December 8, 2019, a journalist from The Intercept approached Nunes and asked what his calls with Parnas were about. The journalist also asked whether Nunes was involved in the campaign to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Nunes responded by retreating from the journalist and his cameraperson, pulling out his phone and filming the news team without answering the questions. Security then asked the journalists to leave.
