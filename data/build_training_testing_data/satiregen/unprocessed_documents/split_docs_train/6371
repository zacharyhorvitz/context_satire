Thomas "Tam" Mullen is portrayed by Mark Cox. A self-confessed "miserable bastard", he is always tricking people into giving him free belongings or buying him a drink, and is known for his unapologetic greed. Tam enters competitions to get hold of free goods (which, much to the others' annoyance, he always wins), and in some episodes appears to be almost delirious at the thought of getting freebies. He married the local librarian, Frances Drummond, in the episode "Ring." Peter McCormack (better known as "Pete The Jakey") is a familiar sight to residents of Craiglang. The archetypal tramp, Pete also has a very active imagination. Ignored by many, he seems to have always been about; he often is seen sleeping outside Navid's. A man of many secrets, it is later revealed that he was the father of the property developer who wanted to demolish The Clansman and that he may or may not work for the government. Archie (2004) Played by Sylvester McCoy. A reclusive man. Despite being a friend of Jack and Victor, he hasn't set foot outside his house since the mid-1960s. His reason for this is that he was evacuated during the war to a farm and was comfortable with a peaceful life.
