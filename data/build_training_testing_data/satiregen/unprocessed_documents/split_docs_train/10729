The club is the best-known of 17 surf lifesaving clubs in the Northern Region of New Zealand, and possibly one of the best-known surf lifesaving clubs in the entire country. Its high-profile is partly being due to its participation in the television series and partly through its location on one of the country's most-popular surfing beaches. The beach is also a regular venue for the annual "Piha Big Wave Surf Boat Classic". The Schwepps Powercraft Congress was held at Piha in 1976 and introduced many clubs in New Zealand to the value and capabilities of IRBs. Don and the Speights family worked together to develop the Arancia Inflatable Rescue Boat with the Mk I Arancia IRB being tested at Piha in November 1978. During this test the first ever rescue of a swimmer washed up on rocks occurred. Don knew how boats worked and with others such as; Rob Ferguson, Murray Wood, Basil Vertongen, Loius Jordian, John Hosiaux spent a lot of time getting the engines and hulls right and promoting their use. During a rescue, the swimmer quickly donned the belt and headed into the surf, the reel was carried to near the waters edge and the reel-man and the lines-men paid out the line as the swimmer headed towards the patient. The best swimmers in the club were used as belt-men, as towing the line was like swimming whilst towing a bucket on a rope. If there was a sideways rip and too much line was payed out the swim became very arduous. Once the patient had been reached and secured the belt-man raised his arm to signal that he was ready to be pulled in.
