 Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes "amicably settled" their divorce just two weeks after Holmes filed for it, an attorney told CNN Monday. While no details of their agreement are public, the former couple said they are "working together" in the "best interests" of their young daughter. In the June 28 divorce filing, Holmes sought sole custody of 6-year-old Suri. Holmes and Cruise have been married for five years. Morton's book describes Cruise's relationship with Katie Holmes, his sexuality, and Cruise and Holmes' beliefs. Morton also asserts in the book that Holmes had to "audition" for the status of Cruise's girlfriend, and won the part over other actresses. The book also discusses details about Cruise's marriages to Mimi Rogers and Nicole Kidman, his relationship with Pen√©lope Cruz, his behavior on The Oprah Winfrey Show, and his denunciation of Brooke Shields for using anti-depressants to help her cope with postpartum depression. Morton consulted a former senior Scientologist, who asserted that Kidman's lawyer had advised her not to publicly discuss Scientology or to speak out against it, even though she "hated" Scientology when Cruise left her in 2000. Kidman and Cruise were invited to Gold Base in 1990 after spending time together on the set of Days Of Thunder. Morton writes "When Tom confided to the Scientology leader about the couple's fantasy of running through a meadow of wild flowers together, his friend apparently decided to make his dream come true." Morton writes that around the same time Cruise was beginning his relationship with Rogers, Miscavige made an announcement at a Church of Scientology rally "The most important recruit ever is in the process of being secured. His arrival will change the face of Scientology forever."
