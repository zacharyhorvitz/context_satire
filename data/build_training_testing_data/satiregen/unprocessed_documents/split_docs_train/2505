Syrians (Arabic: سوريون‎), also known as the Syrian people (Arabic: الشعب السوري‎, ALA-LC: al-sha‘ab al-Sūrī; Syriac: ܣܘܪܝܝܢ‎), are the majority inhabitants of Syria, who share a common Levantine Semitic ancestry. The cultural and linguistic heritage of the Syrian people is a blend of both indigenous elements and the foreign cultures that have come to rule the land and its people over the course of thousands of years. The Syrian Arab Republic has a population of 19.5 million as of 2018, which includes minorities such as Kurds and others. The dominant racial group are the Syrian descendants of the old indigenous peoples who mixed with Arabs and identify themselves as such, in addition to ethnic Arameans.  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has said the United States has "lost its cards" in Syria, calling on America to leave the country in an interview with Russia Today. "The Americans should leave. Somehow, they're going to leave. They came to Iraq with no legal basis, and look what happened to them.  Days before Kim Jong Un is set to meet US President Donald Trump in Singapore, the North Korean leader is revealing plans to meet  yet another leader -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad will visit Kim in North Korea, the latter country's state news agency KCNA said Sunday. The report did not specify a date for the meeting, and Syrian state media has so far not reported on the planned visit. If the meeting takes place in Pyongyang, it would be the first time a world leader has visited Kim in the capital.
