There are many stories surrounding the origins of Auburn's battle cry, "War Eagle." The most popular account involves the first Auburn football game in 1892 between Auburn and the University of Georgia. According to the story, in the stands that day was an old Civil War soldier with an eagle that he had found injured on a battlefield and kept as a pet. The eagle broke free and began to soar over the field, and Auburn began to march toward the Georgia end zone. The mythical War Eagle I has the most colorful story of all of the "War Eagle" eagles. War Eagle I's story begins in the Civil War. According to the legend, a soldier from Alabama during the Battle of the Wilderness came across a wounded young eagle. The bird was named Anvre, and was cared for and nursed back to health by the soldier. The reason behind the "War Eagle" mantra is because in 1913 during a game against Georgia, the Tiger Mascot came out to the field with an eagle on its arm. To kick off the game, the mascot released the eagle into the sky and cried out "War Eagle" and thus the tradition of saying the mantra to fans of Auburn and to fans of competing teams began. There are several stories about the origin of the battle cry. One of these is a mythical story published in 1959 in the Auburn Plainsman, conceived by its then  editorial page editor, Jim Phillips.
