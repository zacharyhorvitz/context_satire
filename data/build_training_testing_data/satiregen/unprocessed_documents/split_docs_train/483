 After a long, bruising primary season, Hillary Clinton made history Tuesday night, becoming the first woman to lead the presidential ticket of a major political party in the United States. "Thanks to you, we've reached a milestone," Clinton said to a large crowd of supporters in Brooklyn's Navy Yard. "Tonight's victory is not about one person. It belongs to generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and made this moment possible."  Hillary Clinton embraced her moment in history Tuesday, becoming the first woman in the 240-year life of the United States to lead the presidential ticket of a major political party. "Thanks to you, we've reached a milestone," she said during a speech in Brooklyn. "Tonight's victory is not about one person. It belongs to generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and made this moment possible."  Hillary Clinton wants to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination. Just not in Long Beach. Clinton has spent the last three decades waiting for the moment when she could claim the mantle as the the first woman to become the presumptive presidential nominee of a major political party. So when CNN, the Associated Press and others called her race against Bernie Sanders on Monday night, one would think she would celebrate.
