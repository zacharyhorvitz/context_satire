Prior to 1881, a Street Cleaning Bureau functioned under the New York City Police Department. However, streets were filthy, filled with mud, rubbish, ash, and horse urine and manure. On May 29, 1881, all the bureau's books and papers were transferred from the police headquarters in anticipation of the passage of a law creating a new administrative structure and the separate Department of Street Cleaning. On May 30, the bill enacting the Department of Street Cleaning was signed by Governor of New York Alonzo B. Cornell. Like the rest of New York's uniformed forces, the rank and file have a collective nickname: "New York's Strongest," a term coined by Harry Nespoli, long-time President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 831, to describe the Department of Sanitation's football team in the late 1970s to early 1980s. The section of Worth Street between Centre and Baxter Streets in Manhattan is named "Avenue of the Strongest" in their honor. Not long after the building began sales, the New York City Department of Sanitation announced the construction of a truck garage across the street, at 353 Spring, which sparked controversy and a downturn in sales. The space was originally occupied by a UPS lot and a smaller Department of Sanitation building. During development, purchasers were made aware that a high rise or a garage could someday occupy the space. The new structure drew ire due to worries that it would obscure views of the Hudson River for many of the residences in the building.
