Hanson's trial began on December 21, 1840. Hanson's defense attorneys, Franklin Dexter and George T. Curtis, argued that no proof had been found of Hanson purchasing and administering poison to Kinney. The prosecution called a servant who worked in the Kinney household as a witness, and she reported seeing a piece of paper in the kitchen with "poison" written on it, but testimony was not concluded to be ample enough evidence to convict Hanson. During the trial, it was confirmed that Kinney had been treated for syphilis immediately before his death, and arsenic was a well-known medication prescribed to treat venereal disease at the time. Kinney and his thugs specialized in armed robbery, burglary, and extortion. Snake's biggest early rival was George "Baldy" Higgins, an alcoholic sadist who was jealous of Snake's success. Kinney killed Higgins in a street fight in the early morning hours of September 20, 1896. Snake was acquitted on a charge of self-defense. On August 30, 1840, Hanson was visiting friends in Thetford, Vermont when she was arrested for the murder of George Kinney and transported back to Boston. Hanson was held in prison for four months awaiting trial. According to Hanson's autobiography, she lived in cell number 5 in the common jail. The cause of death on Kinney's autopsy read arsenic poisoning.
