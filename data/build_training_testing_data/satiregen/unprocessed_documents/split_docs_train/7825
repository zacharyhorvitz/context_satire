During the past decade, Provo School District has constructed four new schools (Timpanogos Elementary, Lakeview Elementary, Provo Peaks Elementary and Spring Creek Elementary). On November 4, 2014 a bond measure for $108 million passed. This will be used to rebuild five schools. Over the next few years, Provo High School, Edgemont Elementary School, Rock Canyon Elementary School, Provost Elementary School and Sunset View Elementary School will be rebuilt. Sixteen of the elementary schools in the district are named for presidents of the United States, while one school's name was inspired by its close proximity to Lakeview. The elementary schools are: The Lakeview school district was formed in 1968 in response to Columbus Public Schools deciding for financial reasons to no longer admit non-resident tuition students. Lakeview High School opened in the fall of 1969 and graduated its first class in 1970. In 2009, the district moved seventh- and eighth-graders to the Lakeview High School building and added six classrooms in order to alleviate crowding at its two feeder schools, Shell Creek Elementary and Platte Center Elementary, following the closure and sale of another school, Sunrise Elementary, to Archer Daniels Midland.
