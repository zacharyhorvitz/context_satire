On creating the first gay couple in a Star Trek series, Cruz said he "felt like it was a long time coming.... What's great about the way that the show is handling it is it's not like we are having a special two-hour episode about gay relationships in space. It's not that. They just happen to be in love, and they happen to be coworkers. And, I hope by the time we get to  century that it will be exactly like that." At the end of the Season 10 finale (Season 10 Episode 18, Hell to Pay), along with Constable George Crabtree and Constable Slugger Jackson, Henry is caught in an ambush; all are shot and possibly murdered. Inspector Brackenreid, who is portrayed by Colm Meaney in the TV movies and in the TV series by Thomas Craig, is a middle-aged married man, fond of the theatre and a good drink. He is the head of the stationhouse and does most of the interrogating, often forming opinions of a suspect because of personal impressions or their social standing. Quick to anger and tenacious, with a sarcastic sense of humour, he is better at traditional "coppering" and is very proud of his job and what he feels is his duty to protect the city.
