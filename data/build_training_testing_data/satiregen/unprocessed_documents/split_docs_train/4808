 Amid growing concerns about his successor's treatment of the media, President Barack Obama began his final press conference on Wednesday by stressing the importance of a free and adversarial press corps. "We are accountable to the people who send us here," Obama said of his office. "You're not supposed to be sycophants. You're supposed to be skeptics."  "The only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world." With that parting message to the nation, a sanguine Barack Obama sought to reassure the millions of Democrats disorientated and fearful about Donald Trump's pending inauguration that presidents may change but the nation always endures. Still, in his final news conference as president, Obama warned that only an active citizenry and relentless political engagement can preserve what he sees as the successes of his administration and the values he believes have already made America great. Obama drew a figurative line between his about-to-expire administration and the incoming Republican one that aims to destroy much of his legacy.  President Barack Obama will hold his final news conference Wednesday afternoon in the White House briefing room. The event, two days before his term ends and President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office, will likely be the final time Americans will hear from Obama as a sitting commander in chief. It follows a tradition from past presidents of holding a concluding news conference. President George W. Bush took his final round of questions from reporters on January 12, 2009, eight days before Obama was sworn in.
