 The story of a biblical miracle that saved a man's life from blazing bullets has turned out to be a myth, police in Ohio said. The account by a public transit bus driver who said a devotional Bible carried in his chest pocket stopped two shots fired at his heart isn't true, said Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl on Wednesday. "Based on the evidence, this crime did not occur as reported," he told CNN affiliate WDTN. The incident took place in February. After Imari is abducted by Kitami, the lesser demon leaves Minase and he realizes that he loves Imari and must save her. With the help of Takashiro and the Bible Black, he finds a spell Takashiro believes will stop Kitami's evil scheme. By this point, it is Walpurgis Night once again, and Kitami plans to reincarnate herself into Imari. Kitami slits her wrists and has sexual intercourse with Imari as the reincarnation ritual demands, but Minase interrupts it and casts his spell on Kitami. Using the book's magic, Minase is able to make Rika Shiraki fall in love with him, as well as help his friend, Ayumi Murai, get the boy she loves to love her back. Reika Kitami, the school nurse, hears of his magical acts and decides to sway him to her since she needs the book for herself. Twelve years prior on Walpurgis Night, Kitami was used as a sacrifice for the previous Witchcraft Club and only survived after making a deal with Satan, becoming a hermaphrodite in the process. Kitami now needs a virgin girl to act as a vessel for her reincarnation as the life that Satan has given her is running out.
