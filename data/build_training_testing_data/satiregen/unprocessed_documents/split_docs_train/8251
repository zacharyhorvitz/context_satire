Eliot’s Murder in the Cathedral. According to Blair, it was a failure, but her English teacher told her not to give up; that was the first time she thought she could be an actress. In 1993, she began training at acting schools in New York. In October 2018, Blair revealed that in August she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. She had thought, for years, that she was suffering from minor illnesses or even a pinched nerve, but the diagnosis finally explained her disabilities, including her occasional falling, dropping things, foggy memory, and her left side acting like it was "asking for directions from a broken GPS." Blair was inspired to reveal the news as a way to thank Allisa Swanson, her costume designer, who had become her unofficial "dresser" for Blair's role in the Netflix series Another Life, stating that Swanson "gets my legs in my pants, pulls my tops over my head, (and) buttons my coats."
