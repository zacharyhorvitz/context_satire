Alicia will depart during the thirty-third series on 19 January 2019. Connie informs Alicia that she has been put forward for a paediatric job away from Holby. Halfpenny described the offer as "an amazing opportunity" for Alicia. After accepting the job, Alicia then receives a marriage proposal from Ethan, which leads her to question whether she wants to stay for "the comfort of Ethan and doing the job she knows and loves". Disillusioned with the NHS, Alicia creates an anonymous blog called "Rage in Resus", which outlines the struggles that the emergency department are facing. Halfpenny explained that Alicia finds the blog "important" and believes it is about more than the ED; it is about the NHS. The blog receives a lot of attention from hospital staff and the public, while also upsetting some people. Halfpenny stated that this was never Alicia's goal when she created the blog. When Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) warns Ethan to find the owner of the blog, Alicia begins to struggle with the pressure of maintaining her secret. Ethan reaches "the end of his teather" while trying to find the blog owner and accuses Alicia of being responsible. Halfpenny explained that Alicia did not think that Ethan would accuse her due to their close relationship. She stated that Alicia becomes "more and more panicked" by the popularity of the blog, although she believes that the blog is directed at the ED and its leadership rather than Ethan himself.
