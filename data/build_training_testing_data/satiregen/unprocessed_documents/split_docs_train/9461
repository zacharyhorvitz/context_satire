Both schools were charter members of the Southeastern Conference when it was established in 1932. Since that season, Tennessee has a 53–14–3 record against Kentucky, including a streak of 26 straight victories from 1985 to 2010, which is one of the longest such streaks in NCAA history. The Wildcats did not win any games against the Volunteers during the 1940s, 1990s, or 2000s. The only decade of the SEC era in which UK posted a winning record against Tennessee was the 1950s, when they went 6–3–1. Hewlett was a Director for Hexcel Products Incorporated (became Hexcel, founded by his wife Flora's brother in law Roscoe "Bud" Hughes ) from 1956-1965, and worked on their executive committee. Hewlett served as a Director of Chase Manhattan Bank (became JPMorgan Chase) from 1969-1980. Hewlett was also elected to the Board of Directors for Chrysler Corporation in 1966, a position he held until 1983. After spending two and a half seasons managing the Mariners and guiding the team to a 44–33 (.571) record this season, including a major league-best 25-12 record since May 22, manager Mike Hargrove shocked the team by announcing his resignation prior to a July 1 game against the Toronto Blue Jays. Hargrove said he could no longer give the same passion or commitment to his bosses and players. Bench coach John McLaren was named as Hargrove's replacement. The Mariners won eight consecutive games between June 23 and July 1, making Hargrove the first manager since 1900 to resign his position after a winning streak of more than seven games.
