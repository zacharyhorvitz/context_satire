Martin's influence in the music field is also seen in the effect he has had on co-producers. The music site Stereogum singles out three people as his "disciples", Savan Kotecha, Dr. Luke, and Shellback. Time Magazine reported that "There's a cluster of high-powered songwriters who are based in Sweden, and the grandmaster is Max Martin and that when Kotecha worked with One Direction he credited Martin's influence 'We work melody first. That's Max Martin's school. Max Martin first worked with Jessie J on her international hit "Domino" after Dr Luke and Claude Kelly sought to create a song that showcased her vocals whilst also capable of being a commercial success. Alongside the aforementioned trio and Cirkut, Max Martin co-wrote the track and the song lived up to its hoped-for success becoming her major breakthrough into the US market, charting at number 6, whilst also topping the charts in the United Kingdom for two weeks. It charted in the top 50 most bought tracks in the US for 2012 and was the 8th best selling song in the same year within the United Kingdom with a sales figure of 749,000 in that year alone. It also achieved top ten success in other countries such as Canada and Australia. Plans for a fourth film in the Mad Max series hit financial difficulties and the project spent several years in "development hell". In 1995, George Miller re-acquired the rights to future Mad Max films from Warner Bros. The idea for a fourth instalment occurred to Miller in August 1998 when he was walking in an intersection in Los Angeles. About a year later, while travelling from Los Angeles to Australia, the idea coalesced.
