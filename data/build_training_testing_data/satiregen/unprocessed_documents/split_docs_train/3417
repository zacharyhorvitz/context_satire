 Flu vaccinations may become painless again. A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee voted Wednesday to recommend, once again, that FluMist, the nasal spray version of the influenza vaccine, be used during the 2018-19 season. For the past two flu seasons, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel of immunization experts, has not recommended the needleless option. However, the panel voted 12-2 this week to include FluMist as an option for doctors to use during next year's flu season, CDC spokesman Ian Branam said.  The deadly grip of the flu season appears to be weakening, according to statistics released Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During the seventh week of the year, 6.4% of people who visited their doctors complained of flu-like illness, the CDC said in its weekly surveillance report. That number is down from the previous week, when it was 7.5%. It's the first time this season the number has dropped.  The flu vaccine may have an important benefit beyond protecting against influenza: It may also prevent heart attacks, especially in those at high risk, experts say. "It's been a long time that people have recognized that association with flu season and development of a heart attack," said Dr. Kevin Schwartz, an infectious disease physician at Public Health Ontario. When it comes to preventing heart attacks in people with cardiovascular problems, experts have put getting the flu vaccine on par with long-term measures such as quitting smoking or taking one's medication for high blood pressure. Doctors don't fully understand what about the flu might lead to heart attacks in some people.
