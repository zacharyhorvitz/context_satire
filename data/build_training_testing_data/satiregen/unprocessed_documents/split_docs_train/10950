 "What should be the conversation now about sexual harassment?" That's what Charlie Rose asked New York Times reporter Jodi Kantor on October 20, in a "CBS This Morning" segment about the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Now, Rose himself is out as a morning host after facing sexual harassment allegations of his own. Like every journalist these days, Rose spent a lot of time talking about the harassment stories that have been making headlines.  Charlie Rose was suspended by CBS on Monday after eight women accused him of sexual harassment, with allegations including groping, unwanted sexual advances and inappropriate phone calls. The Washington Post broke the news about Rose, a co-host on "CBS This Morning," a "60 Minutes" correspondent and the star of an eponymous PBS interview program. It published claims from the women -- three of whom went on the record -- in a story that became the latest to allege that a member of the media's power class demonstrated inappropriate behavior. "Charlie Rose is suspended immediately while we look into this matter," a CBS News spokesperson said.  The sexual harassment and assault claims against powerful men keep rolling in, and this week, it's Charlie Rose under scrutiny after a stunning piece in The Washington Post detailed allegations of years of Rose's harassment and unwanted sexual advances toward younger female employees and prospective employees. In a statement, Rose apologized, adding, "I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken." CBS News fires Charlie Rose This shouldn't come as a surprise: Rose played the role of dirty older man on CBS for years.
