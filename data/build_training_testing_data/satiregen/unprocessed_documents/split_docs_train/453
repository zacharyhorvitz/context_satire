 California's drought is changing the way the state's 914 golf courses do business. The green-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see courses just won't be possible to sustain anymore. Trees are being replaced with cactuses and other drought-resistant plants. Some courses are getting rid of grass altogether.  It's more than just one state's internal problem. The historic California drought hurts the rest of the union, too. That's because California is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. Here's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state, a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted Gov.  The Golden State could soon refer to the hue of California's lawns. Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday imposed mandatory water restrictions for the first time on residents, businesses and farms, ordering cities and towns in the drought-ravaged state to reduce usage by 25%. "We're in a new era," Brown said.
