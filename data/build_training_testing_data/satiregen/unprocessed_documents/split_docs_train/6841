The school has had two mascots. Early on in the school's history, the athletes were referred to as the "Fighting Teachers" until the students chose the name "Sycamores", from the abundance of Sycamore trees in Indiana and especially in the Wabash River Valley; though it is believed that the students voted on 'Sycamores' on a lark, never thinking it would win. During the 1950s and 60s, the sycamore tree itself was used as Indiana State's mascot, with a student dressed in a tree costume. However, as a tree does not lend itself well to an athletic mascot, especially considering Indiana State's in-state rivalries with the Ball State Cardinals and Butler Bulldogs, the university created an Indian mascot named Chief Ouabachi, and his Princess, in 1969.  Eight-year-old Ava Bullard comes bounding out of the Georgia Senate chamber, a smile stretched from ear to ear. Ava's mother, Anna, bends down to talk to her daughter over the din in the hallway. Her own smile is all business, with a wink to the camera. "What did he say?"  A lockdown imposed Tuesday afternoon at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis has been lifted, according to the school's Twitter account. Students and staff at the university had been asked to take shelter earlier Tuesday afternoon while police investigated a report of an armed person on campus. According to the school's Twitter account and website, students were to "remain in shelter location until an All Clear is received." That all-clear message came at 4:36 p.m. "Now returning campus to normal operations," the tweet read.
