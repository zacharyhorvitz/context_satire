In 1923 Tennessee, two best friends, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, play together in the back of an old biplane, pretending to be soldiers fighting the German Empire in World War I when Danny's drunk father comes and attacks Danny, but Rafe defends him and calls Danny's father a "dirty German" in which he reveals that he fought the Germans in France during World War I and prays the boys never encounter the horrors he saw. The duo never really liked to be referred to as "Hall & Oates." In an interview with Esquire, Oates said, "There isn't one album that says Hall and Oates. It's always Daryl Hall and John Oates, from the very beginning. People never note that. Hall and Oates had collaborated on the USA for Africa "We Are the World" project, with the former as one of the soloists and the latter as a chorus member, and performed at the Live Aid concert in Philadelphia, with Ruffin and Kendrick. The Hall and Oates band also backed up Mick Jagger's performance at this show.
