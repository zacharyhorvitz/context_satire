 Singer, actress and Pete Buttigieg campaign surrogate Mandy Moore dismissed suggestions Monday that the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor is beholden to elites, saying she doesn't "think that Hollywood even knows what to do with him." Moore joined Buttigieg on the trial in Iowa Monday as Democratic candidates are making their final appeal to voters ahead of the last debate before the Iowa caucuses next month. Rival campaigns have sought to cast Buttigieg as being cozy with donors and other influencers, including those in Hollywood, as he's chosen to host lavish fundraisers, unlike some of his competitors. "I've actually never heard that before, and I would say absolutely not -- cozy with the Hollywood folks?  The top six candidates debated Tuesday night in Iowa, the last chance for them to stand beside their rivals before Iowa voters kick off the nomination fight in 20 days' time. I watched, took notes and decided on who had the best night -- and who had the worst. They're below. WINNERS * Pete Buttigieg: The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor proved Tuesday night that he is the best debater in this field.  Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was endorsed by Maryland Congressman Anthony G. Brown on Thursday, the first time the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor, who has struggled to garner black support, won the endorsement of a black member of Congress. Buttigieg also announced that Brown will serve as a co-chair of his campaign, and an aide tells CNN that they plan to have the congressman hit the campaign trail for Buttigieg in the coming weeks. The endorsement marks a significant step for Buttigieg, who has worked for months to make inroads with black voters across the country but has yet to see notable results. Those efforts have concentrated on South Carolina, the fourth state in the Democratic nominating process, where black voters make up a large block of the primary electorate.
