The 2007–08 season started with a friendly marking the death of Danny Bergara, the manager who had brought Gannon to County as a player in 1990. The friendly was against Cardiff City, managed by Dave Jones, who also managed County whilst Gannon was a player at the club. Results continued to go against the Vale though, as on 19 March they lost 3–0 at Accrington Stanley, and as a result dropped out of the play-off zone for the first time in the season. Ugly post-match scenes at the Crown Ground saw Geohaghon confront fans who singled him out for abuse, whilst Gannon was ushered quietly out of the back door. Roberts told the media "I don't think the manager likes me and, to be honest, I don't like him". Rumours circulated that Gannon would soon be on his way out. Gannon was named Manager of the Month for October 2009, but he warned of a clear out in the January transfer window. His young team impressed, but proved to be inconsistent. Gannon had a dispute with the SFA head of referee development Hugh Dallas, following Gannon's criticism of Scottish referees. Gannon had claimed the standard of refereeing was "bringing the game into disrepute".
