 Tonight, former President Bill Clinton is headlining the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, NC. His highly anticipated speech could show he is the Democratic Party's best weapon in November. Last night we heard from a man who worked in the Clinton administration and served as President Obama's White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. Now the mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel talks with Soledad O'Brien on "Starting Point" about trying to bring back the enthusiasm for hope and change that defined the Obama campaign in 2008.  President Barack Obama offers a better path forward for the country that will promote united values rather than the winner-takes-all mentality of Republicans, former President Bill Clinton told the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night. In a highly anticipated speech before Obama was formally nominated for re-election, Clinton framed the November vote as a choice of what kind of country Americans want. "If you want a winner-take-all, you're-on-your-own society, you should support the Republican ticket," Clinton said. "If you want a country of shared prosperity and shared responsibility -- a we're-all-in-this-together society -- you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden."  In Tampa this week, it's not just Republicans in town for the convention. Over the next few days, you'll see a lot of Democratic faces in Florida, dogging and counter-pointing the GOP's every move. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, national co-chair for the Obama Campaign and chairmain for the Democratic National Convention next week in Charlotte, is one of those Democratic voices in Tampa. He says his presence at the RNC is to remind voters what Republicans said during the primary season.
