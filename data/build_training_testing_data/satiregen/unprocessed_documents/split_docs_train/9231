In November 2017, Hannity interviewed the Alabama senate candidate Roy Moore, who was facing accusations of sexual assault and harassment of teenage girls while he was in his thirties. Hannity said Moore "deserves the presumption of innocence" and that "none of us know the truth". After criticism from Media Matters for America, which had been promoting a boycott since May 2017 over previous controversial comments by Hannity, some major advertisers pulled their advertising from Hannity's show. These actions were met with counter boycotts by Hannity's fans who destroyed products made by the companies who removed their promotions from the show and pledged to stop buying their products until the decisions were reversed, causing the CEO of one of the companies to publicly state that the public announcement of his company's removal of advertisements was "unacceptable" and that his company did not intend to take sides in the matter.

Healthy Choice is the name of a brand of refrigerated and frozen foods owned by ConAgra Foods. According to ConAgra's official corporate history, it came into being after then-ConAgra CEO Charles "Mike" Harper suffered a heart attack in 1985. Forced to dramatically alter his diet, he came up with the idea of a line of healthier frozen foods.
