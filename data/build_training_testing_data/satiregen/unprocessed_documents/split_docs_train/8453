 Last week was Iran week -- from the tensions over the detention of 10 U.S. sailors, to the prisoner/hostage swap to the implementation of the nuclear agreement. Like most other issues in a broken, angry and dysfunctional Middle East, dealing with Iran remains a work in progress, including over the nuclear agreement itself. But one thing is clear: Iran, and not a divided and dysfunctional Arab world, is rising politically and economically. So you can forget the Arab spring.  Nothing summarizes the high drama of last week between Iran and the United States more aptly and vividly than these words: "It's the diplomacy, stupid." The big lessons of the eventful week are that diplomacy with Iran works and the model of negotiations established to resolve an incredibly complex and dangerous nuclear impasse with Iran can and must be extended to address the major crises in the Middle East, including the bloody Syrian civil war and the fight against ISIS and other violent Jihadi extremists. The week started when Iran's Revolutionary Guards detained 11 U.S. Navy sailors whose two boats had somehow drifted into Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf. That incident was quickly resolved and the sailors and their boats safely returned to their base. The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country comprising 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe. Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million, the U.S. is the third most populous country.
