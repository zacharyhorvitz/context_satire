 Vice President Joe Biden was back to work at the White House on Tuesday, cracking a joke about his career horizons but offering little clarity into his latest political thinking. Asked in the Oval Office whether he was running for president, Biden told Wall Street Journal reporter Carol Lee, "Only if you're my running mate." Standing near the doors as President Barack Obama described his meeting with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, Biden wouldn't detail his plans further -- and slipped out of the room before Obama finished speaking. The President himself only smiled and laughed when reporters asked him next about his vice president's future plans -- silent on the ever-swelling chatter about Biden's intentions.  President Barack Obama wants to remind us all that presidents are people, too, and every office — even the Oval one — can have issues with its printer. Obama was late for his speech at American University in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday and blamed printer toner for the delay. "I apologize for the slight delay; even presidents have problems with toner," he said. He then smiled as the audience laughed at his comment. Presidents use Oval Office addresses as a way to directly communicate with the American people. It is considered to be a major address and it functions as a way to move public opinion by having a direct connection with the President of the United States. Presidential historian, Robert Dallek stated, “The Oval Office invokes the center of the presidential authority. That's the president's office, that's where he supposedly makes decisions, where he governs.” The tone of the speech is set when Presidents decide to make a speech in the Oval Office.
