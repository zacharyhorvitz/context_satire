 More than a year after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook is cracking down on personality quizzes. Sort of. On Thursday, the company updated its platform policies and said apps with minimal utility, such as personality quizzes, "may not be permitted on the platform." A Facebook spokesperson said that quiz apps aren't banned completely, but will be subject to heightened scrutiny.  Facebook has admitted that it collected up to 1.5 million users' email contacts without their consent, in the latest privacy issue to hit the giant tech firm. The world's biggest social network said Wednesday night that the email contact lists had been "unintentionally" uploaded to Facebook following a design change almost two years ago, and the company was now in the process of deleting them. Facebook said the issue began three years ago when it made changes to the step-by-step verification process users go through when signing up for an account on the platform. Prior to those changes, users were given the option to upload their email contact lists when opening an account to help them find friends already on Facebook.  Facebook is bracing for a massive fine from federal regulators after a year of data privacy scandals. Facebook said Wednesday that it expects an ongoing investigation from the Federal Trade Commission could result in fines ranging from $3 billion to $5 billion. The company set aside $3 billion in legal expenses related to the investigation, which cut into its profit for the first three months of 2019. Facebook's profit for the quarter was $2.4 billion, a decrease of 51% from the same period a year ago.
