 Several actresses, a production assistant and a scriptwriter are expected to face Harvey Weinstein in court. At least 100 women have publicly accused the disgraced media mogul of sexual abuse, but the vast majority will have no part in the trial. Jurors at a New York state court will only hear six of them. In opening statements Wednesday, prosecutors said Weinstein is "not a harmless old man."  A woman writing a novel about "predatory" older men and their relationships with younger woman will serve as one of 12 jurors who will decide Harvey Weinstein's fate in one of the most high-profile cases in the country. The New York criminal trial of Harvey Weinstein is based on the relationships between the former Hollywood power broker and producer and two younger women. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office is working to prove to the jury those associations included sexual assault and rape, while Weinstein's attorneys maintain his sexual relationships with the two women were consensual. Weinstein, 67, is accused of raping a woman in a New York hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on another woman in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment, court documents show.  Harvey Weinstein, whose alleged predatory behavior sparked the #MeToo movement, is set to face the sexual assault charges that could send him to prison for the rest of his life. Opening statements in his trial are expected to begin Wednesday, more than two years after bombshell stories in The New York Times and The New Yorker quoted women who accused Weinstein of sexual abuse, rape, harassment and generally using his influence as a Hollywood power broker to take advantage of young women. Since then, at least 100 women have publicly accused Weinstein, 67, of a range of actions, from unwanted sexual advances to rape. But the allegations that will be presented to a jury of 12 people in New York State Supreme Court are based off the accounts of two women.
