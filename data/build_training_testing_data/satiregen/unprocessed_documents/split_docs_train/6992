The New York Times said the film "is for customers who will laugh at anything, including that singular unfunny man, Dick Shawn... the waste of energy, costumes and backgrounds is truly appalling." Marlon learns that Shawn's old friend Terrell (Casey Lee) is a deadbeat and plans on not giving back any of the money he borrowed from Shawn. "Saint Pablo" was produced by West himself and Mike Dean, with co-production from Allen Ritter and additional production from Noah Goldstein. It features vocals from Sampha, who sings the hook and the third verse. The song contains samples of "Where I'm From", written by Shawn Carter, Deric Angelettie, Ronald Lawrence and Norman Whitfield, and performed by Jay Z.
