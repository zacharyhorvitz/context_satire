The winning numbers are  6,27,46,51,56 and 21. The current Powerball format was introduced on 19 April 2018, using two Smartplay Halogen II draw machines with the intention of offering bigger jackpots and creating more overall winners. In each draw, seven regular numbers will be selected from a pool of 35, while the additional Powerball continues to be drawn from a separate pool of 20 balls. A new, 9th Prize Division will be added. To enable the new format, the cost of Powerball entries will be increased.
