 When the first bomb went off near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, emergency personnel knew to expect another. It occurred just 12 seconds later, and the first responders already present for Monday's  world-famous race that drew tens of thousands of visitors to the city immediately started moving people away from what had been a celebratory scene. In clearing the area so quickly, authorities acted on lessons learned from past terrorist attacks such as the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the Atlanta Olympics bombing in 1996 and the September 11, 2001, attacks, according to security experts. Major public events such as a marathon in a nation that prizes personal freedom can never be made perfectly safe, said Juliette Kayyem, a CNN contributor and former homeland security official.  In the aftermath of dramatic events like Monday's bombing attack at the Boston Marathon, it's a truth of our times that millions of people will get early bits of news via social media. To be sure, sites like Twitter and Facebook were used extensively by police, relief groups and governments to share important information about the bombings. But there's also a more unfortunate side to how the Web responds to sudden bad news. Sometimes accidentally and sometimes maliciously, false information gets loose.  Evidence uncovered so far supports the theory that the two brothers suspected in the Boston Marathon bombings had no help, authorities said Saturday. "From what I know right now, these two acted together and alone," Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau told CNN. "I think we have to be ever vigilant, and we're learning as we go along, but as far as this little cell -- this little group -- I think we got our guys." Deveau said investigators were continuing to look into where Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26. and Dzhokar Tsarnaev, 19, may have gotten the resources to amass the cache of weapons used in the bombings and afterward.
