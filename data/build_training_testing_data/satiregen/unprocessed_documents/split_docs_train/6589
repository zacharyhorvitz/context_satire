 Texas Republican Congressman Roger Williams was especially stunned as he sat in school on November 22, 1963, and heard President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. Earlier that morning, he stood outside the Fort Worth Hotel with his mother and shook the President's hand right before he got on a plane and flew to Dallas. "I literally was the last person to shake his hand as he left the hotel," Williams told CNN. He was 14 years old at the time.  Five decades after it served as the backdrop for a nation's grief and disbelief, Dallas' Dealey Plaza took center stage once again Friday as Americans commemorated the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's assassination. "A new era dawned and another waned a half century ago when hope and hatred collided right here in Dallas," Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said in his remarks commemorating Kennedy's death. Rawlings then read the final words of the speech Kennedy was to deliver that day. That was followed by a moment of silence at 12:30 p.m., the time Kennedy was shot a few feet from where Rawlings spoke.  Jeff Franzen was just 6 when he saw John F. Kennedy shot. Nearly 50 years later, he recalled that fateful day. His family had gone to downtown Dallas to shop. They set up in a park near the end of the parade.
