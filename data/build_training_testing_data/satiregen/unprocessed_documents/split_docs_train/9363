Ohio State University (OSU, commonly referred to as Ohio State) is a public research university in Columbus, Ohio. Founded in 1870 as a land-grant university and the ninth university in Ohio with the Morrill Act of 1862, the university was originally known as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College. The college originally focused on various agricultural and mechanical disciplines but it developed into a comprehensive university under the direction of then-Governor (later, U.S. president) Rutherford B. Hayes, and in 1878 the Ohio General Assembly passed a law changing the name to "The Ohio State University". The main campus in Columbus, Ohio, has since grown into the third-largest university campus in the United States. Michael V. Drake, former chancellor of the University of California, Irvine, became the 15th president of the Ohio State University on June 30, 2014. He announced on November 21, 2019 that he would be retiring at the end of the 2019-2020 academic year. Also in 1878, the Ohio legislature recognized an expanded scope for the university by changing its name to "The Ohio State University". The definite article "the" is part of Ohio State's legal name; since at least the 1990s, Ohio State alumni, especially NFL players, have emphasized the "The" when referring to their school ("THE Ohio State University"). In 2019, Ohio State filed for trademark protection of "the" when it is used to refer to Ohio State; the application was denied.
