By the end of Gilman's presidency, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Press, Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum had been founded;  the latter by the trustees, and the others in the order listed under the Gilman administration. "Sex" and "color" were major issues in the early history of the Johns Hopkins Institutions. The founding of the School of Nursing is usually linked to Johns Hopkins' statements in his March 1873 instruction letter to the trustees that "I desire you to establish, in connection with the hospital, a training school for female nurses. This provision will secure the services of women competent to care for those sick in the hospital wards, and will enable you to benefit the whole community by supplying it with a class of trained and experienced nurses". The idea for You Don't Know Jack began while That's a Fact, Jack! was still in development. The game's title comes from the less vulgar version of the phrase "You don't know jack shit." The Brody Learning Commons, an appendage to the Milton S. Eisenhower Library, opened in August 2012 and is the most recent of the Johns Hopkins' libraries (known as Sheridan Libraries) to open. Primarily a study space, it houses a variety of different areas for study including group study rooms, a quiet reading room and a cafe. The BLC is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week and is also where the University's Department of Special Collections and Department of Conservation and Preservation reside.
