On April 2, 2015, nearly 5 years following the accidental shooting of Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Weekley has been reestablished to active duty as a Detroit police officer. The department decided to withdraw the police officer from active duty shortly after the incident that took place on May 16, 2010. Weekley was transferred from Special Response Team to the Criminal Investigations Bureau. Police Chief James Craig states, "He'll be in a limited duty capacity. The Detroit Police Department was administered directly by the Mayor. Prior to the riot, Mayor Cavanagh's appointees, George Edwards and Ray Girardin, worked for reform. Edwards tried to recruit and promote blacks, but he refused to establish a civilian police review board, as African Americans had requested. In trying to discipline police officers accused of brutality, he turned the police department's rank-and-file against him. Hill joined the Wayne County Sheriff's Department in 1957, but quickly became disillusioned with the slow pace, so he joined the Detroit Police Department in 1959. In 1969 he was promoted to detective and was assigned to the homicide division the following year. Over the next decade, Hill rose to national attention for his ability to obtain confessions out of the most notorious killers. He was involved in the investigation surrounding the Atlanta Child Murders in 1979 that ultimately resulted in the trial and conviction of Wayne Williams.
