In June 2013, Tesla announced the goal to deploy a battery swapping station in each of its existing supercharging stations, to be renamed Tesla stations. At an event at Tesla's design studio in Los Angeles, CEO Elon Musk demonstrated a battery swap operation with the Tesla Model S, which took just over 90 seconds each for the two cars participating in the demo. The swapping operation took less than half the time needed to refill a gasoline-powered car used for comparison purposes during the event.  Elon Musk is keeping Tesla a public company. Making it a successful public company will take more work. After less than three weeks, Musk abandoned his plan to take Tesla private. He had said he wanted to free the company from the pressure of Wall Street's obsession with short-term results.  Elon Musk thinks he could take Tesla private at $420 a share. But one Tesla investor thinks that's a bad idea -- because the stock could be worth nearly ten times that amount in the most optimistic of scenarios. Cathie Wood, CEO of money management firm ARK Invest, wrote an open letter to Musk earlier this week saying that Tesla could be valued somewhere between $700 and $4,000 per shareâ€¯in five years. Wood tweeted out a link for the letter to Elon Musk Wednesday night.
