Deborah Ward has just been released from prison, and immediately plans to get her revenge on Richard Martinez, aka Bianca Del Rio. Deborah tricks Richard into going to Russia in hopes of getting him arrested. But when Deborah's daughter Carly and Richard's slightly mentally ill friend Rex are arrested and sent to a gulag Deborah and Richard must put their differences aside and rescue their loved ones. In an epilogue, a traumatized Ward stands on top of the finished dam, and says that knowing what he knows about this place, he will never drink its water, and affirming his fear that more  beings like the Color may find their way to Earth as well. Before winning RuPaul's Drag Race, Del Rio had already garnered attention as a comedian and drag queen in the New York City and New Orleans drag scenes. She would often host and MC events, including Mardi Gras and Southern Decadence. Del Rio became friends with Kugelman, who wrote the film specifically based on him, stating "Tall, slender and glamorous, but with the mouth of a truck driver, I immediately thought that Bianca was a total movie character, and that this would be the story that I develop for my first feature." After the two had decided to pursue the venture, a crowdfunding site was set up on Indiegogo and was sponsored also by  Fractured Atlas.
