 Hillary Clinton believes, finally, that the force is with her. The former secretary of state's tactics and performance in Saturday's Democratic debate suggested that she thinks that though her campaign struggled out of the gate following a series of personal missteps, the nomination may be finally within her grasp as voting in first-in-the-nation states looms. Sometimes, the fights politicians chose to skip reveal as much about them as the ones they decide to wage. And Clinton sent a clear signal in New Hampshire about where her real targets lie in the 2016 presidential race. Starting in November 2015, in connection with his presidential campaign, Sanders's announcements suggested that not only was he running as a Democrat, but that he would run as a Democrat in future elections. When challenged by Clinton about his party commitment, he said, "Of course I am a Democrat and running for the Democratic nomination." Since he remained a Senator elected as an independent, the United States Senate website continued to refer to him as an independent during the campaign and upon his return to the Senate. He confirmed at the end of the campaign that he remained an independent in the Senate for the balance of his term since that was how he was elected.  Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign raised more than $1 million on Friday, in part off an email charging that the Democratic National Committee tilted the scales toward Hillary Clinton after the DNC cut off Sanders from a crucial voter database, a campaign aide said Saturday. "The reality is that the huge turnouts that we've had at our meetings, our strong fundraising, our volunteer base, and quick rise in the polls have caused the Democratic National Committee to place its thumb on the scales in support of Hillary Clinton's campaign," read the email. "You see that fact evidenced in their decision to bury the Democratic debates on weekends during nationally televised football games. It's more or less an open secret."
