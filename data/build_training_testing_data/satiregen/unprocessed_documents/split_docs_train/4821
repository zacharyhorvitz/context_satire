 USC Upstate, a small college in South Carolina, was in mourning Monday after four student-athletes died from injuries in a car wreck. Students at the school of about 6,000 students in Spartanburg planned to hold a candlelight vigil Monday night in the school soccer stadium. The school urged students to wear green, the school color. The school website showed green ribbons being tied to trees around campus.  Kristen Shorey gave birth to her second baby this summer in a marble-lined bathtub surrounded by LED candles and rested afterward on a queen-size mahogany bed. She received no pain killers, never saw a doctor and was home with her newborn son, Rowan, seven hours after birth. It was nothing like the hospital experience where she had her first son two years ago, she said. In fact, the June birth wasn't in a hospital at all but at the Greenville Midwifery Care & Birth Center.
