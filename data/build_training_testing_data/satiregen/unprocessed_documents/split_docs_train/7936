Thompson's most popular role to date is that of Dr. Patrick Drake on the ABC soap opera General Hospital. Since playboy Patrick Drake's first appearance on the show, he has flirted with various women (many who work at the hospital call him Dr. Hottie in reference to his good looks and as a tribute to fellow ABC hot doc Grey's Anatomy's Dr.McDreamy), saved many lives, and mended a contentious relationship with his father, Dr. Noah Drake (played by returning castmember Rick Springfield). In one storyline, Patrick donated a part of his liver to save his father's life. At the same time, Patrick began falling for his co-worker and friend, the HIV-positive Dr. Robin Scorpio, which brought up the question of whether Patrick could give up his womanizing ways. Thompson remained with the Pirates through 1985, batting .259 with 93 home runs and 354 RBIs in his five seasons with the club. During Spring training 1986, he was dealt to the Montreal Expos for two minor leaguers. He lost his starting job to rookie Andr√©s Galarraga shortly into the season, and was released on June 30. Thompson was unable to continue his career due to knee injuries. Thompson played college soccer at Eastern Illinois University from 2000 to 2002. Thompson had a very strong start in his freshman year, surprising everybody by scoring 21 goals to lead the NCAA Division I, and was named the Missouri Valley Conference Newcomer of the Year and chosen for Soccer America's All-Freshman team. Thompson's next year was mediocre, due to injuries, as he scored only five goals. Thompson did significantly better in 2002, however, finishing the year with 14 goals and four assists, earning him a first-team All-Midwest selection.
