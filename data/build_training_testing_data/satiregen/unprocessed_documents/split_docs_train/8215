 From Mitt Romney's apparent growing confidence to Newt Gingrich's fading expectations, to Rick Santorum's coming under increased scrutiny, there's a new political reality in the Hawkeye State with just four days to go until the Iowa caucuses. As six of the major Republican presidential candidates stump across Iowa on Friday, the campaign landscape has been altered. The transformation was captured by a CNN/Time/ORC International poll released Wednesday, which showed Gingrich's support among likely Iowa GOP caucus-goers plunging, one-time long-shot candidate Rick Santorum more than tripling his support since the beginning of the month, and Romney slightly edging out Rep. Ron Paul of Texas for the top spot among the field of White House contenders. Romney starts Friday with a campaign rally in West Des Moines before heading to New Hampshire, which holds the second contest on the primary and caucus calendar. On January 16, it was reported that there was "a very real chance that the Republican Party of Iowa will announce this week that Rick Santorum, and not Romney, won the Iowa caucuses," citing various campaign sources who reported that the final numbers will be different from those released on caucus night. Republican Party of Iowa executive director Chad Olsen said on January 17 that there have been errors giving both Santorum and Romney more votes than reported on caucus night.  Iowa's Republican electorate shattered Tuesday night, showing a party establishment under siege and voters unable to coalesce behind any candidate in a deeply flawed field. The big winners in first-in-the-nation caucus state were establishment favorite Mitt Romney, libertarian outsider Ron Paul, and social conservative star Rick Santorum. But the state's inability to deliver a clear verdict may have taken Romney -- the candidate with the most money and strongest machine -- one major step closer to the GOP nomination. The biggest loser: Michele Bachmann.
