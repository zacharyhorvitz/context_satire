 Presidential candidates have canceled their events in South Carolina after nine people were killed in a church Wednesday evening in what police have labeled a hate crime. President Barack Obama expressed his condolences during a press conference before leaving for California, "Any death of this sort is a tragedy, any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy, there is something particularly heart breaking about a death happening in a place in which we seek solace, we seek peace." "To say our thoughts and prayers are with them, and their families and their community doesn't say enough to convey the heart ache and the sadness and the anger that we feel," Obama said. Hillary Clinton, who had been campaigning in South Carolina earlier on Wednesday before the shooting, used a campaign appearance in Las Vegas on Thursday to address the massacre.  President Barack Obama and other top Democrats -- including Hillary Clinton -- find themselves in a familiar place following the mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, on Wednesday: Pleading for gun control while knowing it's unlikely to happen. "At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this kind of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries," he said, taking a long pause before continuing. "It doesn't happen in other places with this kind of frequency. It is in our power to do something about it."  President Barack Obama on Thursday called the nine deaths in the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting "senseless murders" and suggested more gun control is needed in the wake of the tragedy. "Any death of this sort is a tragedy. Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy," said Obama, as Vice President Joe Biden stood alongside him. "There is something particularly heartbreaking about death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace."
