 Poor Americans would lose billions of dollars worth of federal benefits under the Senate GOP tax bill, according to a new Congressional Budget Office report. This is largely because the legislation would eliminate the individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty. This would result in 13 million fewer people having coverage in 2027, the CBO found. Many of the folks who would forgo coverage would have lower or moderate incomes and would have qualified for Medicaid or federal help paying their premiums or out-of-pocket health expenses, CBO found.  Let's say you have health insurance through your employer and live in one of 21 states with laws protecting consumers against surprise medical bills from out-of-network providers. Should one of those unwanted bills land in your mailbox, you can turn to your state law and regulators for help, right? Not necessarily. If you're among the millions of Americans with a category of job-based health coverage known as self-funded insurance, most state health care laws do not apply to you.  Two months ago today, Hurricane Maria made direct landfall in Puerto Rico, devastating the island and wiping out the power grid and transportation infrastructure for its millions of residents. Now, a broad 70% of Americans -- with majorities in both parties -- think that Puerto Rico is not getting the help it needs in the wake of Maria's destruction, according to a new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation. That number has grown from 63% who said the same last month, with the number of Republicans concerned climbing from 38% to 52%. Only two in 10 think the American citizens on the island are getting the help they need in the wake of the storms.
