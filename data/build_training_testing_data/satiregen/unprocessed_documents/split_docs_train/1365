This article presents the discography of Ringo Starr, former drummer and occasional singer and songwriter of British rock band the Beatles. When the band broke up in the spring of 1970, Ringo Starr embarked on a solo career. Along with the other Beatles, he spent the first half of the seventies on Apple Records, the label created by the band for themselves. Starr moved to Atlantic Records after his contract with EMI expired and his career diminished in commercial impact, even though he continued to record and eventually tour with his All-Starr Band in 1989 and continues to do so today. Martin said that he was against the idea of a double album at the time and suggested that the group reduce the number of songs to form a single album featuring their stronger work, to which the band refused. Reflecting on the album years later, Harrison said that some tracks could have been released as B-sides, but "there was a lot of ego in that band." He also supported the idea of the double album, to clear out the backlog of songs that the group had at the time. Starr felt that the album should have been released as two separate records (that he nicknamed "The White Album" and "The Whiter Album"). In 1998, he released two albums on the Mercury label. The studio album Vertical Man marked the beginning of a nine-year partnership with Mark Hudson, who produced the album and, with his band the Roundheads, formed the core of the backing group on the recordings. In addition, many famous guests joined on various tracks, including Martin, Petty, McCartney and, in his final appearance on a Starr album, Harrison. Most of the songs were written by Starr and the band.
