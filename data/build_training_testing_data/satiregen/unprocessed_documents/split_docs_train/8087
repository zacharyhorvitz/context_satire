 The head of the AFL-CIO has stepped down from the White House's manufacturing council after President Trump doubled down on his position that violence in Charlottesville was perpetrated by many sides at a press conference Tuesday. Richard Trumka said in a statement posted on Twitter that he "cannot sit on a council for a President who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism," and called Tuesday's remarks "the last straw." The statement was jointly issued by Thea Lee, an economist who previously served as deputy chief of staff at the AFL-CIO. She also resigned from the council.  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has become the third top business leader to step down from President Trump's manufacturing council on Monday. He follows the chiefs of Merck and Under Armour, who announced their decisions earlier Monday amid the fallout over Trump's response to violence over the weekend at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. "We should honor -- not attack -- those who have stood up for equality and other cherished American values. I hope this will change, and I remain willing to serve when it does," Krzanich wrote in a blog post on the Silicon Valley company's website late Monday.  President Trump's manufacturing council keeps on shrinking. The number of council members who have quit following Trump's remarks about white supremacists has risen to six after one of the country's most powerful labor union leaders said he was stepping down. Richard Trumka, leader of the AFL-CIO, issued a statement on Tuesday saying "I cannot sit on a council for a President that tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism." His resignation came shortly after Trump told reporters on Tuesday that "both sides" were responsible for violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
