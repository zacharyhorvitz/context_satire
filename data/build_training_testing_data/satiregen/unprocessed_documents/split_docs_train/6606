Pro Tools 9, released on November 4, 2010, was the first version not requiring proprietary hardware, allowing use of the software with any interface. It could operate using the internal sound card of a PC via the ASIO driver and a Mac using Core Audio. Core Audio also allowed, for the first time, the use of aggregate devices, allowing the use of more than one interface at the same time. This could also be achieved on a PC by using any ASIO free anternatives. The first version of Pro Tools was launched in 1991, offering four tracks and selling for US$6,000. Digidesign continued to improve Pro Tools, adding a sequencer and more tracks, with the system offering recording at 16-bit and 44.1 kHz. In 1997, Pro Tools had reached 24-bit and 48 track versions. At this point, the migration from more conventional studio technology to the Pro Tools platform took place within the industry. Well, it’s the production software program, basically. The people at Babygrande were asking for a name. I was looking around the house, or the studio, and trying to come up with something, and I may have even been reading the actual Pro Tools manual and just went with that, and it works great with the album.
