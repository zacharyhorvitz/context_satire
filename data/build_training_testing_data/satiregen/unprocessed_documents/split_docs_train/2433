 The results are in from the one of the largest and broadest surveys of health in the United States. And although many of the findings are encouraging -- more Americans had health insurance and fewer smoked cigarettes in 2015 than in previous years -- the gains were overshadowed by rising rates of obesity and diabetes. Every year since 1957, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been asking Americans 18 and older about their health and the health of their family members as part of the National Health Interview Survey. The new report contains data from the 2015 survey, which included more than 100,000 people.  The presidential candidates talk a lot about how they'll bring jobs back and restore the nation's once-mighty manufacturing sector. Jason Kester has been trying to do that every day for more than three years. As executive director of the Southern Ohio Port Authority, Kester is charged with spurring economic development in Scioto County, Ohio. The county, which sits just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, was a thriving manufacturing hub decades ago, but its industries and many of its remaining factories are mere shells of their former selves.  "The Americans" had been renewed for two more seasons, which will mark the end of the critically acclaimed FX drama's run. The extension includes a full 13 episodes for next year, and a truncated order of 10 for a sixth and final season in 2018. While the show has never been a major ratings draw, it has generated positive reviews, and accolades from groups like the American Film Institute. Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell star as a pair of Soviet spies, operating on U.S. soil in the 1980s.
