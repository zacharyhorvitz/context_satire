 In the space of six weeks, with great displays of importance, India's capital will have hosted two world leaders who no longer speak with each other: the presidents of Russia and the United States. India sits uncomfortably between these two adversaries. Pick your geopolitical topic -- Syria, Iran, Ukraine -- and you can be sure that Moscow and Washington will be at odds with each other. New Delhi has been watching from afar, sitting on the fence.  Choo-choo! China is combining two giant state-owned railcar companies with an eye toward gobbling up major foreign contracts. The railcar firms, CSR and CNR Corps., have reportedly filed an application for a merger to the Chinese government. Although this still requires government approval, it's unlikely to be rejected -- state media have reported that the government cooked up the merger. The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country comprising 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe. Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million, the U.S. is the third most populous country.
