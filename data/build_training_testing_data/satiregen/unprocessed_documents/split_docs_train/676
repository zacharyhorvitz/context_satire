 Paris prosecutors are investigating if an electrical short-circuit caused the fire that ripped through Notre Dame Cathedral. A judicial source told CNN on Thursday that "we are not excluding any hypothesis at this stage," saying that this is not their only line of inquiry. Since Tuesday, Paris prosecutors have been investigating what could have turned the Gothic masterpiece into an inferno. At least 40 employees at the Paris landmark have been questioned so far.  The cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris is home to scores of priceless artifacts, artwork and relics collected over the centuries, each with their own story. As a devastating fire tore through the revered Gothic cathedral on Monday, toppling its spire, many feared these treasures might be lost forever. A "forest" of wooden latticework fueled the blaze which consumed the building's roof, whose framework dates back to the 13th century, according to Msgr. Patrick Chauvet, the cathedral's rector.  Prosecutors investigating the causes of the inferno that tore through Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris have interviewed construction workers and security staff, as more details emerged about the effort to contain the blaze. Ten people were interviewed by criminal investigators on Wednesday, the Paris Prosecutor's Office said, adding that interviews would continue on Thursday. On Tuesday, the prosecutor's office had said 30 employees at the Paris landmark had been questioned. "Tomorrow new witnesses will be heard as well as people already interviewed for further information," the prosecutor's office said.
