The Onion's portrayal of Joe Biden is a satirical caricature of Joe Biden, who was the 47th Vice President of the United States between 2009 and 2017. Also known as "Diamond Joe" or "Uncle Joe", The Onion's Biden is not a straightforward exaggeration or parody of the real Biden, but rather, a distinct character with outrageous qualities who shares little in common with his source. The Onion portrayed Biden as a blue-collar "goofy uncle", a muscle car driver, a raucous party animal, a petty criminal, and even a drug-dealing gang member. The character became one of The Onion's most popular creations of the Obama era, garnering critical acclaim and large numbers of page views.  Former Vice President Joe Biden is clearly leaving the door open to running for president in 2020, saying in an interview published Wednesday he hasn't ruled it out. "I haven't decided to run," he told Vanity Fair. "But I've decided I'm not going to decide not to run. We'll see what happens." In an April 2016 interview with CNBC, Biden said that he was "not comfortable with goofy Uncle Joe ... And by the way, the so-called goofy Uncle Joeâ€”if you notice, I beat every Republican in every poll when they thought I was running . You notice that my favorability was higher than anybody that's running for office in either party." While this was not a direct comment on The Onion, Biden's image as "goofy Uncle Joe" was closely associated with, and influenced by, The Onion.
