 President Donald Trump will make his final pitch on tax reform to the American people Wednesday in a speech that will not "lean in on as many of the specifics as his prior tax reform speeches," according to two senior administration officials who briefed reporters Tuesday. The administration sees this as a higher-altitude speech, saying the President has already addressed specific rate brackets in previous speeches. Joined by about 120 people -- families and military personnel who have been invited -- the President will speak Wednesday afternoon from the Grand Foyer of the White House. Some young people will be among those invited, and the President will dedicate a "very significant portion" of his speech to the next generation that will be affected by tax reform.  President Trump thinks more poor people should work. Congressional Republicans do, too. So expect to hear the phrase "work requirements" a lot next year. It will likely be a central feature of the GOP's planned overhaul of the nation's safety net.  A record number of Americans are expected to travel this holiday season, with AAA forecasting more than 100 million will spend the end of the year away from home. According to AAA, between December 12 and January 1, 97.4 million Americans will make their journeys by automobile, while 6.4 million are expected to take airplanes. Another 3.6 million will use trains, buses or cruise ships to head to their destinations. Those traveling by car are doing so despite facing the highest year-end gas prices in three years, AAA said.
