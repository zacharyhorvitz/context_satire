In April 1994, Professor Elizabeth Newson published Video Violence and the Protection of Children (the "Newson Report") which attracted huge media interest due to its claims that it had "definitively established the long sought-for link between screen violence and the real-life variety," and which cited the Capper murder as an example. Despite its support by the press, however, the report failed to demonstrate any definitive link, "merely drawing inferences from ... often highly speculative accounts in the press rather than independent first-hand research." Newson was called to give oral evidence to the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee on Video Violence, where she asserted: "The Suzanne Capper case is another example of very explicit imitation of video and the use of video and that was Child's Play 3." The chairman of the committee, Sir Ivan Lawrence had to point out to Newson that this was incorrect, and that both the police and the British Board of Film Classification had ruled out any connection between the movie and the murder. David Hill, 18, was asked to "sit in" at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout "Shut up, you slag!" in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: "She had a sort of cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and covering her nose. Over the next five days Capper was subjected to a series of violent acts, "increasing in severity and brutality as the time passed." She was regularly beaten and injected with amphetamines, burned with cigarettes, and had rave music—in particular Hi, I'm Chucky (Wanna Play?) by 150 Volts, featuring samples from the movie Child's Play—played at maximum volume through headphones. McNeilly would commence each torture session with the phrase "Chucky’s coming to play" and soon the words themselves were enough to make Capper scream.
