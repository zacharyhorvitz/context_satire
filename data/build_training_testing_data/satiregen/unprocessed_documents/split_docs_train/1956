Bath & Body Works, LLC. is an American retailer under the L Brands (formerly Limited Brands) umbrella, along with Victoria's Secret. It was founded in 1990 in New Albany, Ohio and has since expanded across 6 continents. In 1997, it was the largest bath shop chain in the United States. The Snickerdoodle scent has also become popular in non-edible products. In 2014, Bath and Body Works launched their "Made with Love" holiday collection. This collection included a Snickerdoodle scented candle. However, this scent failed to gain popularity. The 1990s saw the initial development of the Limited Too, Bath & Body Works, Structure, and Victoria's Secret Beauty. Later in 1998, several Bath & Body Works stores were converted to The White Barn Candle Company stores to begin a home fragrance brand.
