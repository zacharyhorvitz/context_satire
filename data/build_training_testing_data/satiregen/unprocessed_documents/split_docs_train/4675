 Rambling and often incoherent, President Trump made his UN press conference mainly about himself and not about defending his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. He raised the canard that "four or five women who got paid a lot of money" accused him of sexual harassment and implied that he could determine himself whether people accused had actually committed the acts. "I never saw them do anything wrong," he said of his friends Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly. It was a presidential press conference as it would be performed by a comedian.  Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh said in written testimony for Thursday's hearing with a woman accusing him of sexual assault that he is facing a barrage of "last-minute smears." "There has been a frenzy to come up with something -- anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious -- that will block a vote on my nomination," Kavanaugh's testimony said. The Senate Judiciary Committee released the testimony Kavanaugh submitted a day ahead of his scheduled appearance before the hearing on an accusation brought by Christine Blasey Ford, who has said he sexually assaulted her at a party in their high school years. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation along with accusations from others who have gone public since Ford.  Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said Friday that an FBI investigation into allegations against Brett Kavanaugh could change his mind on the Supreme Court nomination, which he had said earlier in the day he would support. Asked by CNN if he could change his vote and oppose the nomination depending on what he learns, Flake responded, "Sure, you bet -- that's why we are doing an extended background investigation." Earlier Friday, Flake, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh. But after being confronted by angry protestors, Flake called for a delay of the floor vote so that the FBI can investigate allegations Kavanaugh faces.
