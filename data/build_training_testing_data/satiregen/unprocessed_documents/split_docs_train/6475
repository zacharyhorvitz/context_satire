Terry Gilliam, who co-founded Monty Python and directed Williams in two of his films, The Fisher King and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), said in 1992 that Williams had the ability to "go from manic to mad to tender and vulnerable ...  the most unique mind on the planet. There's nobody like him out there." Robin McLaurin Williams (July 21, 1951 â€“ August 11, 2014) was an American actor and comedian. Born in Chicago, Williams began performing stand-up comedy in San Francisco and Los Angeles during the mid-1970s. After rising to fame playing the alien Mork in the sitcom Mork & Mindy, Williams established a career in both stand-up comedy and feature film acting. He was known for his improvisation skills and the wide variety of memorable character voices he created. After working for MTV Undergaro decided to make an independent film, which in turn left him bankrupt and homeless, not to mention out of the Hollywood game. There was a silver lining in that film failure though, as Undergaro met Maria Menounos, who was then a 19-year-old with epic dreams of her own. It was at that time that Undergaro committed to Maria's career as he strongly believed in her talents. Undergaro became more serious about life and business, and no longer partook the "college life" of partying.
