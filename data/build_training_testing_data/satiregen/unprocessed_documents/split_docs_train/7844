The rules for the Nobel Prize in Physics require that the significance of achievements being recognized has been "tested by time". In practice, it means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer. For example, half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar for his work on stellar structure and evolution that was done during the 1930s. As a downside of this tested-by-time rule, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. During the occupation of Norway, three members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the Committee building in Oslo was Swedish property. Thus it was a safe haven from the German military, which was not at war with Sweden. These members kept the work of the Committee going, but did not award any prizes.  The announcement of who will receive the Nobel Peace Prize is always most powerful when it taps into the global conversation of the moment. In that sense, the 2018 decision to recognize two people -- Congolese surgeon Denis Mukwege and Yazidi campaigner Nadia Murad -- for their efforts to end sexual violence as a weapon of war could not have been more apt, or better timed. The announcement landed one year to the day since the New York Times published a report on Harvey Weinstein that blew open the #MeToo movement. It also came hours after hundreds of Americans were arrested during protests over the nomination of a Supreme Court judge who has been accused of sexual assault during high school (he denies the claims).
