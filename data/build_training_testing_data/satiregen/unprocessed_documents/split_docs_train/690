 Treasury to Congress: The heat's on to raise the country's debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Wednesday he now estimates he will have less cash on hand to pay the country's bills in mid-October than he previously thought. Instead of the $50 billion he estimated a few weeks ago, he now thinks the cash balance will be closer to $30 billion. "This amount would be far short of net expenditures on certain days, which can be as high as $60 billion," Lew said in a letter to lawmakers.  The United States has never willfully defaulted on any of its legal obligations. So the consequences of doing so are unknowable. But the general consensus is that it could be catastrophic. Or, in the best-case scenario, seriously  damaging to the economy.  Want to bet against the "full faith and credit" of the United States government? A few financial institutions are doing just that -- betting the government will default on its debt if Congress can't agree to raise the debt ceiling this month. If the U.S does default, they could reap a total payout of around $3.4 billion. Sound like a lot?
