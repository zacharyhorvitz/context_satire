 A shark attacked a teenager Monday afternoon as he swam in waist-deep water at Surfside Beach, along Texas's Gulf coast, local police said. The 15-year-old started beating the shark with both hands after it had bitten his lower left leg, according to Surfside Assistant Police Chief Gregg Bisso. The shark then bit the teen on the left hand. Kids from his church group, who were in the water with him, came to his aid after he'd been bitten, Bisso said. He was previously in a relationship with One Tree Hill co-star Sophia Bush, and took the role of Julian Baker in the series to be closer to her. Nichols has been friends with actor Jake Gyllenhaal since the two met on the set of The Day After Tomorrow in 2004. Nichols said in one interview, "I've learned a ton from Jake. He's a really sharp guy. In 2004, Nichols was cast as J.D., an intelligent rich kid and romantic rival to Jake Gyllenhaal's main character in the environmental blockbuster, The Day After Tomorrow. The film received negative reviews but was a box office success. Also in 2004, he appeared in Wimbledon, opposite Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany. The film was well received by critics, though it was only a mild success at the U.S. box office.
