On October 11, she tested positive for Ebola virus, becoming the first person to contract the virus in the U.S. On October 12, the CDC confirmed the positive test results. Hospital officials said Pham had worn the recommended protective gear when treating Duncan on his second visit to the hospital and had "extensive contact" with him on "multiple occasions". In 2014, the hospital was thrust into the national spotlight as the site of the first Ebola case diagnosed in the United States (see Ebola incident). One patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, who allegedly told healthcare workers there that he had recently traveled from Liberia, was not initially diagnosed with Ebola, but sent home. When he continued to become sicker he returned to the hospital, where his Ebola was correctly diagnosed, but he died of the disease. Two nurses who had treated this patient, Nina Pham and Amber Joy Vinson, subsequently contracted Ebola.  United States On October 14 anonymous nurses allege that there were no protocols in the treatment of Thomas Eric Duncan at  Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, that their protective gear was insufficient, and that hazardous waste was allowed to pile up.
