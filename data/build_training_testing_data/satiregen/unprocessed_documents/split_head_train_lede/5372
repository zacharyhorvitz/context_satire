Moments after picking up his carryout order from local restaurant Hunan Palace Monday evening, area man Alden Welch, 31, reportedly experienced a sharp sense of unease upon noticing his takeout bag felt unusually light.Unable to effectively account for the bag’s seemingly low weight given the amount of food he had ordered, sources confirmed that Welch grappled with his increasing alarm and anxiety as he exited the establishment and walked back to his nearby car, quickly becoming entirely occupied by the disconcerting thought that one or more food items had been left out.“Wait, this can’t be right,” Welch reportedly said to himself, slowing his pace as he anxiously appraised the heft of the brown paper sack in an effort to ascertain its likelihood of containing the two entrées, sides of crab rangoon and egg rolls, and double order of white rice he had called in.
