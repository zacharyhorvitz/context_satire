Saying he could hardly believe how much the young man had changed over the past eight years, a visibly sentimental FBI counterterrorism agent fondly recalled Tuesday watching 20-year-old Muslim-American Omar Haddad grow up.While speaking with reporters, Special Agent David Tierney repeatedly paused to marvel at how quickly the time had slipped by, striking a bittersweet tone as he described what it had been like to see the young Muslim boy mature and come into his own as he studied for his classes, made friends, played on the school baseball team, and prayed at his local mosque every Friday.“Sometimes it feels like it was just yesterday that I was watching little 12-year-old Omar get on the bus and head off to seventh grade, but I guess time really flies,” said the FBI agent, expressing amazement at how a middle-schooler who had seemed so shy when talking to girls on the phone could become so confident and self-assured in his conversations as an adult.
