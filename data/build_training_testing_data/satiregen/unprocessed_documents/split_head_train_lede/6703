After months of attempting to indoctrinate his friend with the militant ideology of Islamic fundamentalism, local man Khalid Sayed, an Islamic extremist actively working to create a worldwide community of Muslim believers through violence and terrorism, said he has decided to give up radicalizing his dim-witted friend Omar Alibek.Calling the American-born Alibek “pretty dense” and “slow on the uptake,” Sayed told reporters that instructing the 27-year-old in the goals of global jihad and providing philosophical justification for carrying out terrorist attacks against innocent civilians in the West is “pretty much a lost cause at this point.”“I’ve tried over and over to convince Omar that Islam provides the one and only solution to all problems in this world and that the only way to establish a truly Muslim state is through religious oppression and acts of terror, but it just goes in one ear and out the other,” said the frustrated extremist, noting that Alibek hasn’t retained a single tenet of Sharia law in over six months of attempted radicalization.
