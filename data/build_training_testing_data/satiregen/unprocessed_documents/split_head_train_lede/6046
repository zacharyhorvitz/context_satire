Praising the district’s vast selection of inexpensive goods and its vendors’ willingness to negotiate prices, Pope Francis reportedly spent Thursday afternoon strolling through Vatican City’s Chinatown before purchasing a knockoff golden chalice.Holy See officials said that after leading Mass at St. Peter’s Basilica, the Bishop of Rome walked the three blocks to the sprawling ethnic Chinese neighborhood known for selling anything from Pentecost fireworks to bootleg homily DVDs, as well as countless other deeply discounted ecclesiastical items.“I love coming down here every now and then to explore and maybe pick up a few things if I happen upon a good price,” said the pontiff, pausing briefly beside a booth where colorful plastic rosaries hung from a rack and thuribles stamped with the words “Catholic Church” were piled in a bin.
