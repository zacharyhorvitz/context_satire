In what is certain to be regarded as a defining moment in the nation’s history, leading U.S. political figures gathered at the Capitol today to sign their names to the newly drafted Declaration of Dependence, formally proclaiming America’s total reliance on China.The revolutionary pronouncement, which was ratified unanimously by representatives from across the United States, calls for formal recognition of American dependence and enumerates more than two dozen of the country’s specific dependencies on China, including a $282 billion trade deficit, the $1.15 trillion in U.S. bonds held by China’s central bank, and the fact that each of America’s 314 million residents would be utterly helpless without access to Chinese-produced clothing, plastic goods, and electronic devices every moment of every day.“When in the course of commercial and financial events, it becomes necessary for one nation to affirm its absolute dependence on another, it is imperative for the subordinate people to declare the causes which impel them to feeble servitude,” the Declaration of Dependence begins.
