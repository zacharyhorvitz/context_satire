According to a survey released Tuesday by psychologists at Brown University, couples in the United States have been going through a bit of a rough patch lately, and if something doesn't change, and change soon, the future of their relationships may be in doubt.The nationwide poll, which asked about topics ranging from communication issues to the health of a couple's sex life, found not only that things were pretty much on the rocks, but also that many people weren't even sure anymore if their partners were the same people they once fell in love with.
