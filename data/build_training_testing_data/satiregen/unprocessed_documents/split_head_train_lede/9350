Acknowledging that it’s only a matter of time before his high-risk pursuits finally catch up to him, local thrill-seeker Daniel Erickson told reporters Wednesday that he often wonders just how long he can keep up his extremely hazardous sedentary lifestyle.The 36-year-old IT specialist said that, while he lives for the exhilarating danger that comes from spending nearly every waking hour sitting at his computer, watching television, or playing with his smartphone in bed, he is fully aware that he is balancing on the razor’s edge with each passing, virtually immobile day.“I’m skating on thin ice living my life like this, but chasing after those extreme risks is just in my blood,” said Erickson, who noted that spending the vast majority of his time in a slumped or fully recumbent position is all part of the nonstop game of chance that he thrives on.
