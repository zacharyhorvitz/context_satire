Saying it’s been his dream for as long as he can remember, local man Richard Jensen, 37, told reporters this week that he wants nothing more than to raise his family in the kind of place where white people greet each other on the street with a smile and a friendly word.“I’ve always imagined my kids growing up in a nice little town where white people aren’t in too much of a hurry to say hello to other white people,” the insurance broker and father of two said of his hopes to someday move to a quiet community whose white residents still take the time to ask how one another’s white families are getting along.
