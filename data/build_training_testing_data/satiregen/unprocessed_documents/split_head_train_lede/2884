Saying the bold new infrastructure project would serve the needs of local residents through the 21st century and beyond, city officials announced Monday that work was finally complete on Clevelandâ€™s long-awaited elevated sewer system.The one-of-a-kind open-air wastewater transportation system, which stands three stories above the street and runs a total length of more than 60 miles throughout the metropolitan area, will reportedly move an estimated 90 billion gallons of raw sewage across the city each year, carrying urine and feces from the suburbs to downtown, and from University Circle to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
