The growing publick Outcry over the North American BALD EAGLE grew ever more voluminous this week, as disgusted citizens demanded that the Congress act to address this INFESTATION of the nuisance Species, which has been such a Plague on Americans of late, and has recently become ever more so, due to its o'er-whelming Numbers, fear-less Personalitie, and nigh-unto-endless , which extends from the farthest northern Climes to the southernmost realms of these newly united States.The heavy-brow'd, angry-looking CREATURE, chosen by the Founders as our Nation's National Bird due to its ubiquitous Presence, has long been a familiar Sight, roosting in ev'ry Tree, Barn, publick Lamp-Post, and Church-Steeple, across the LAND.But in recent years this screeching, rapacious Predator, flying this Way and that, has become a great Inconvenience, and Men have grown sicke of the sight of it.
