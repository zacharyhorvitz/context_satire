Theorizing that their work most likely represents a groundbreaking scientific achievement of some kind, researchers at Stanford University announced Thursday that they have made an unclear breakthrough by giving a robot cancer.The team of oncologists and mechanical engineers told reporters that after years of research and repeated trials, they had finally succeeded in causing an aggressive form of advanced cancer to spread throughout a laboratory robot’s mechanized arm and central processing unit, noting that this landmark accomplishment probably has beneficial implications for the scientific community or society at large “or something like that.”“Right now, what we can absolutely say for sure is that this robot has Stage IV cancer and only has two to three months left until it succumbs to the disease.”“Diagnostic testing has confirmed that our robot has developed a high concentration of malignancies throughout its entire structural framework, which, for all we know, could turn out to be incredibly important to science,” said lead researcher Amos Cruise, noting that the degenerative disease is corroding the machine’s circuitry at a rapid rate, a development that he stated might potentially lead to further advancements in cancer research or robotics or maybe electrical engineering.
