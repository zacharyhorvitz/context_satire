A team of leading archaeologists announced Monday they had uncovered the remains of an ancient job-creating race that, at the peak of its civilization, may have provided occupations for hundreds of thousands of humans in the American Northeast and Midwest.According to researchers, these long- forgotten people once flourished between western New York state and Illinois, erecting highly distinctive steel and brick structures wherever they went, including many buildings thought to have held hundreds of paid workers at a time.“It’s truly fascinating—after spending a certain number of hours performing assigned tasks, the so-called ‘employees’ at such facilities would receive monetary compensation that allowed them to support themselves and their families,” said archaeologist Alan H. Mueller, citing old ledgers and time-keeping devices unearthed at excavation sites in the region.
