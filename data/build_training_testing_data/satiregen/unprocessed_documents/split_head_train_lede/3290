In what doctors are calling a true medical miracle, local construction worker Kal Mathyssen awoke from a week-long coma early Wednesday with the ability to fully comprehend his health insurance plan, sources at Parker Adventist Hospital confirmed.Mathyssen, who sustained a severe head injury after a fall at a nearby job site, reportedly stunned hospital staff and family members when he suddenly regained consciousness around 1 a.m. and began confidently filling out all the paperwork required by managed care company Aetna to receive the benefits guaranteed by his insurance policy.“I was online struggling to figure out what is and isn’t covered by our plan, and then Kal just woke up and somehow knew exactly what needed to be done,” said Mathyssen’s wife, Carol, explaining that prior to his coma, her husband had possessed only an average person’s understanding of the process required to file for reimbursement of medical expenses.
