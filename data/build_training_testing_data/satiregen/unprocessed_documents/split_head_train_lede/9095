The National Weather Service is reporting that the clouds over Minneapolis have parted, the sun is shining, and the sky is just a little bluer today—and it’s all because 38-year-old Doug Bramowski is in love, folks.NWS meteorologists predict that since Bramowski’s head over heels for Abby Feldman and, by golly, she’s crazy about him, too, Twin Cities residents will be enjoying particularly beautiful weather this weekend with highs in the mid-to-upper 70s, unusually low humidity, and crystal-clear skies as far as the eye can see.“We have St. Paul at 81 degrees, Montevideo holding steady at 83, Grand Forks, you’re looking gorgeous, and ladies and gentlemen, that’s all thanks to the fact that our own local Romeo is sitting pretty with a new lady love who’s put a pep in his step and a twinkle in his eye,” said local news station KSTP TV’s chief meteorologist Steven Meola.
