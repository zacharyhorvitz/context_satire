Noting that the end-of-life trend has become increasingly prevalent in recent decades, a report released Friday by the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that a growing number of elderly citizens are now dying surrounded by their coworkers.According to the report, tens of thousands of American men and women in their 70s, 80s, and even 90s are passing away in office and retail workplaces every year, typically with their longtime professional colleagues and supervisors gathered around them at their cubicles or sales counters.“We found that more senior citizens than ever are spending their final moments in the company of supportive coworkers while splayed on their conference room floor or slumped against the side of a photocopier,” said the report’s lead author, Claire Gardner, noting that several hundred elderly Americans perish from heart attacks or pulmonary embolisms while stocking shelves or delivering PowerPoint presentations each workday, up sharply from just a generation ago.
