Having established a reputation among the Flagstone Marketing staff as a quiet and reserved temporary worker, Kevin Bright completely shocked his coworkers this week when it was discovered that, outside the office, the mild-mannered 27-year-old is actually an embarrassingly unskilled singer-songwriter.“I don’t think Kevin’s said more than five words to me in the month he’s been here, so I was really surprised to find out he has this whole pitiful music hobby on the side,” said account executive Sandra Hutchinson, 39, who was among several employees that happened by chance to attend one of the soft-spoken and largely forgettable temp’s horrendous sets at a local coffee shop Tuesday.
