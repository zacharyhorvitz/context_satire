Increasingly worried by the changes they have noticed in the supreme deity’s behavior, heavenly sources expressed concern Thursday that God, Our Holy Father, was falling under the influence of a self-styled spiritual guru calling himself “the Rishi.”The charismatic middle-aged man, who began counseling God on a regular basis after the divine Creator attended one of his free transcendental meditation seminars last September, has reportedly had a profound effect on the Lord’s beliefs, lifestyle, and even His diet, leading members of the angelic community to fear the Almighty may no longer be capable of making decisions without the Rishi’s guidance.“At first it seemed like just some harmless self-exploration, which was fine, until God started quoting the Rishi all the time and mentioning out of nowhere how the Rishi had opened His eyes to the truth,” said the archangel Jophiel, adding that God now seems to always carry a copy of the Rishi’s self-published book, , with Him wherever He goes.
