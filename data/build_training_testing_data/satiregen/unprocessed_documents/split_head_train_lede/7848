Fearing that any further delay might prevent their movement from having any meaningful impact, a consortium of leading conservationists confirmed Wednesday it is attempting to get a head start on preserving the planet Mars.The newly formed group, known as the Redder Tomorrow Foundation, has reportedly begun fundraising, developing awareness campaigns, and crafting policy proposals, all with the aim of establishing safeguards to protect the natural beauty and delicate balance of the fourth planet from the sun.“If we want to have any chance at all of saving this planet, we need to get started right now, before it’s too late,” said foundation president Sandra Wright, warning that while the condition of Mars has remained stable for millions of years, it could be gravely threatened by pollution, toxic waste, or the exploitation of its natural resources as early as the next decade.
