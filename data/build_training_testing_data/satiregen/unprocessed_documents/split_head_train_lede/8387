In an effort to provide much-needed assistance to the beleaguered terrorist organization, a charity concert known as Rock The Caliphate—featuring U2, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa, and other top musical acts—was held last night to raise money for the struggling Islamic State.According to event organizers, the star-studded benefit, held before a crowd of nearly 100,000 at the Los Angeles Coliseum and live-streamed over the internet to millions more, aimed to bring together the biggest names in pop music and fund relief efforts that will aid ISIS militants in their attempt to reestablish a caliphate and return to the territories they once called home.“We can no longer turn a blind eye toward the devastation faced by this group of radical Islamists,” said Bono, U2 frontman and one of the concert’s organizers, who appeared on stage in his trademark wraparound shades and with an ISIS flag draped over his shoulders.
