Six months after deciding his life was just too hard and fleeing over the border to Ethiopia, cowardly Eritrean man Ismael Semed continues to hide from his problems at the Berahle refugee camp, sources confirmed this week.According to international aid workers, the 33-year-old refugee, a member of East Africa’s Afar ethnic group who wimped out and abandoned his home last May following a violent raid by the Eritrean Army, would rather run off and live in a makeshift tent in the middle of the desert than own up to the challenges in his life and deal with them like a grown man.“When the going got tough, Ismael could have bucked up and addressed his issues face-to-face, but instead he just took off to a different country at the first sign of trouble,” Red Cross worker David Rowe said of the pathetic runaway, noting that Semed threw in the towel the second a large, well-armed military regiment raided his village and slaughtered his family.
