Arriving from around the world for a three-day political summit, the highest-ranking government officials from over 190 nations have gathered in Zurich this week for direct talks on how fucking incredible it is to run a country.The annual international forum, which is attended by presidents, prime ministers, and various other heads of state from global superpowers as well as emerging countries, is expected to address such longstanding points of discussion as how unbelievably awesome it is to control an entire nation’s political system, command its military, and directly influence the lives of every single person within its borders.“While those of us gathered in this room may have differences in our politics and our ideologies, there is one thing that unites every one of us: We are each the single most influential, valuable, and powerful person in countries composed of millions of people, and that is fucking amazing,” said U.S. president Barack Obama in the summit’s opening keynote address.
