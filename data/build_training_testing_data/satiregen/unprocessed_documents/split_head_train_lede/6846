According to a report released Tuesday by the Brookings Institution, the lone non-telepathic individual living in the world today is still completely unaware that every other human being has the ability to mentally receive and channel thoughts.Researchers said their findings conclusively proved that the individual is currently relying on sensory perception to obtain information and is completely oblivious to the fact that family members, friends, and strangers around the world are psychically communicating at each and every moment and have been doing so since 1998.“Even though it’s been nearly 15 years since every other human on earth mysteriously gained the power of telepathy, it appears the subject is still absolutely clueless to this fact and is apparently no closer to acquiring extrasensory powers,” said the report’s lead author, Rafael Brody, transmitting his statement to the press entirely through the routine process of thought projection comprehended by every human in the world except one.
