Emphasizing the need for parents and law enforcement officers to take immediate action, officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a statement Friday confirming that the first 48 hours are the most crucial in locating children who had vanished through a portal to a fantastical world.The agency’s top investigators—who have reportedly worked on numerous cases in which children had gone missing after crawling through a small hole in the hedges, discovering an ancient cave hidden behind a waterfall, and wandering through a magical gateway on a part of the family’s estate they were forbidden to visit—stated that the chances of recovering a child from an otherworldly realm of kaleidoscopic colors and fanciful creatures drops by almost 90 percent after the first two days.“As soon as we learn a child has disappeared down a pool of light underneath their staircase or through a strangely shaped attic door they had never before noticed, we must act fast to assemble search parties and cover as much enchanted territory as possible,” said investigator Joe Phillippe, who urged parents to contact authorities immediately if they believed their child had passed into a gleaming world of crystal palaces or been transported back in time to the age of King Arthur.
