Following Congress’ inability to hammer out a last-minute budget agreement, the federal government earlier today entered into a partial shutdown under which the greatest country on the planet—that shining example to all other nations in the world—will be unable to keep the William H. Gross Stamp Gallery open, sources confirmed.Owing to widespread pay freezes and the furloughs of various federal government workers brought on by the shutdown, directors at the Gross Gallery confirmed that the world’s towering bastion of wealth, cultural might, and democratic ideals will be incapable of maintaining the 12,000-square-foot gallery devoted to the history and exhibition of postage stamps.“Due to the government shutdown, I regret to report that the William H. Gross Stamp Gallery will remain closed until further notice,” said National Postal Museum director Allen Kane, relaying the information that the earth’s richest, most powerful nation, and the envy of every other sovereign nation on the planet, cannot support a series of rooms displaying stamps.
