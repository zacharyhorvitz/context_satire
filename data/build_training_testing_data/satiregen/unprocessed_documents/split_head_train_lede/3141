After more than a year of writing and recording, Bruce Springsteen released his 18th studio album Tuesday, a concept record titled  that explores the  everyday lives and struggles of immigrant workers scraping by in the 23rd-century carbonate mines on Mars.According to the 61-year-old songwriter, the new tracks depict rugged Martian colonists as they come to question what's happened to their lives, finding themselves saddled with unpayable debts and hard-pressed to put food on the table for their embryonically harvested juvenile-clones.
