Parks reminisced fondly about the business’s humble beginnings as a modest six-cell prison.Parks recalled how he founded HCG in 1986, back when “[he] was just a kid,” in his words, with a single government contract and only a handful of convicts to his company’s name, pausing often to share colorful asides about his business’s early struggles.
