Gathering around the strange object and speculating about its possible significance, scores of Iowa residents were reportedly left mystified Wednesday morning after a single sign bearing the cryptic word “Kasich” inexplicably appeared on the side of the road overnight.Neighborhood sources said they had never before seen anything like the 12-by-18-inch rectangle of blue and white plastic, which had materialized on the front lawn of 38 Victoria Street sometime during the late night or early morning hours.
