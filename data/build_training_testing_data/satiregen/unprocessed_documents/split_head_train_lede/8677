In what authorities are calling one of the most wide-reaching and deplorable cases of embezzlement in recent history, seven executives at Goodwill Industries International were arrested Thursday for allegedly skimming used clothing, old furniture, small appliances, and thousands of other donated items from the charitable group.“We’re looking at some very serious abuses at the highest levels of Goodwill’s corporate hierarchy,” said FBI lead investigator Samuel Corson, addressing reporters as he stood next to a table piled high with dozens of CRT computer monitors and Rainbow Brite lunchboxes confiscated in recent federal raids.
