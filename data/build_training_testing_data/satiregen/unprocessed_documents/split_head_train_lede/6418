Sharing their thoughts and opinions on a wide variety of topics and hot-button issues, five friends eating dinner at Tapper’s Bar and Grill Wednesday had a lengthy, animated, and utterly incoherent discussion about current events, sources confirmed.In spite of numerous loud proclamations made by the individuals and several lively back-and-forth dialogues, witnesses confirmed that at no point during the impassioned 45-minute conversation did any member of the group make a single fully informed or well-reasoned statement about politics, economics, foreign affairs, or social matters.“When Obama got elected, I expected him to overhaul Washington, but he’s just like any other politician,” said 29-year-old David Rubin, making what sources noted was a potentially justifiable claim before immediately undermining it with a muddled, incredibly bewildering line of reasoning.
