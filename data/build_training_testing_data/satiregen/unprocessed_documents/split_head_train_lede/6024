Touting the layout’s benefits in promoting communication and a more productive penal environment, the Illinois Department of Corrections unveiled its new open-plan prison Friday at the Menard Correctional Center.Menard officials told reporters that the penitentiary has eliminated the concrete walls and individual holding cells normally associated with state prison facilities, opting instead for a free, nonrestrictive arrangement in which the detention center’s 3,400 convicted felons share a collective space, where they can take advantage of collaborative opportunities afforded by the newly remodeled floor plan.“With this new open layout, we’re fostering a communal correctional environment that encourages camaraderie and cooperation among all our prisoners, short-timers and lifers alike,” said prison administrator James DeNault, adding that the bright, airy environment creates a more inviting maximum-security space for convicts.
