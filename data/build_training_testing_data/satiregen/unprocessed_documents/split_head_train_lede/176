With most respondents stating that they simply aren’t ready for such a major commitment, a Gallup poll released Wednesday confirmed that a majority of Americans are not looking for a serious, long-term candidate right now.The poll, which surveyed thousands of registered voters across all 50 states, revealed that seven out of 10 citizens are only considering supporting candidates on a short-term basis and have no plans to settle down with any one politician in the near future.“Over time, most voters will find a presidential candidate they want to stick with for the long haul, but for the time being the electorate is just looking for something casual,” said Gallup spokesman Arnold Wheeler, adding that, at this stage, the average American still isn’t exactly sure what he or she wants in a politician.
