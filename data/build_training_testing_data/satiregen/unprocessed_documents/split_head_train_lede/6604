In an attempt to tell the story of his failed candidacy in his own words, former Florida governor Jeb Bush has rented out a local black box theater and debuted a one-man show that chronicles the tragedy of his 2016 presidential campaign, sources reported Thursday.According to those in attendance opening night, the two-act solo piece, entitled , traces the 64-year-old’s path from well-heeled Republican frontrunner to presidential also-ran in a 150-minute performance that features monologues, character vignettes, musical interludes, and a 10-minute interpretive dance sequence in which Bush starts out as an egg and then goes on to reenact his childhood.Clad in a black T-shirt and black jeans, the onetime White House hopeful reportedly moves barefoot across the stage, which, apart from a single lectern, is completely empty.“Why, you might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when people expected big things from me—though I don’t suppose you’d want to hear about that, would you?” Bush wonders aloud during an early scene, speaking as an elderly version of himself and hobbling downstage with a cane in his hand.
