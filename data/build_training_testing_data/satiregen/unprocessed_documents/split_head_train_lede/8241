Expressing shock and an immense sense of grief, numerous high-ranking figures across corporate America were reportedly left shaken Friday after learning of the sudden death of longtime consumer Arthur Henderson.Executives within the multi-billion-dollar retail, technology, dining and hospitality, and financial services industries told reporters that they were completely blindsided by the 68-year-old retiree’s abrupt passing, emphasizing that the beloved, reliable customer continued spending until his final moments.“When I heard the devastating news about Arthur’s death this morning, I immediately had this awful, sinking realization that he wouldn’t be coming into our Charleston locations ever again,” said visibly distressed Target Corporation CEO Brian Cornell while being comforted by members of the company’s board of directors.
