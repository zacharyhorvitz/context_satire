Appearing upbeat and optimistic upon leaving the offices of Red Spur Media on Thursday, local job applicant Marc Tullman told reporters he totally nailed his interview with the man who will make his existence a waking nightmare for the next five years.The 32-year-old prospective marketing analyst said he “knocked it out of the park” during his meeting with Red Spur vice president Peter Palmero, who in just several weeks will start casually dismissing Tullman’s ideas and begin to routinely embarrass him in front of colleagues, setting the hellish tone of his work life for years to come.“I just walked into that office and absolutely crushed it—it couldn’t have gone any better,” said Tullman, who according to sources will have impossible expectations placed upon him every single day by Palmero and, as the years of inevitably failing to live up to those standards go by, will be reduced to a deflated husk of a man.
