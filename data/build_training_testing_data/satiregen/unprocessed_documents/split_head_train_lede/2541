Hoping to ensure the survival of the popular women’s cut in the event of a global catastrophe, officials announced Thursday the addition of the inverted bob to the Supercuts Arctic Vault, a secure state-of-the-art facility that preserves the world’s hairstyles for future generations.Executives at the hair salon chain said the long-in-front, short-in-back bob has joined the approximately 400,000 haircuts already carefully cataloged and stored inside a sprawling concrete bunker built into the side of a mountain on a remote island 800 miles from the North Pole.
