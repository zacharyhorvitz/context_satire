Citing the 75 percent increase in ticket prices over the past decade, a report published Thursday by consumer research firm McGann & Associates found that the rising cost of admission to Walt Disney World is prompting more parents to leave their children at home when visiting the popular resort.According to the study, while real wages in the U.S. have remained stagnant over the past 30 years, the price of a one-day theme park pass has increased fivefold, a development that is forcing many mothers and fathers to drop off their kids with relatives or family friends before traveling by themselves to patronize the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, or any of Disney World’s other properties.“For most U.S. households, the previously common practice of taking the whole family for a long weekend to Disney World is now simply out of reach, leaving parents with no choice but to go to the park on their own,” said the report’s author, Marie Dolan, who added that the average family simply does not have enough in savings to buy more than two tickets at their current cost of $105 apiece, a price that she was quick to point out did not even include a water park add-on option.
