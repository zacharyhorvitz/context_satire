Overweight Penn State University freshman Kyle Norton cleared up any confusion about the future of his daily wardrobe Monday when he declared that, despite the recent drop in temperature, he will continue sporting the same mesh Penn State Lacrosse shorts and Birkenstock sandals he has worn since the start of the 2007â€“08 academic year.The lunchtime announcement, which was made at Penn State's Pollock dining hall, followed a week of speculation as to why the 19-year-old failed to return from Thanksgiving vacation with essential winter clothing items such as pants, socks, boots, or closed-toe shoes.
