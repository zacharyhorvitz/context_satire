Gazing longingly at the happy, loving family as they sat down to eat, all 315 million Americans gathered outside the dining room window of Edward and Karen Langhorne on Thursday night to watch the couple and their children enjoy dinner together, sources confirmed.Bathed in the glow of the brightly lit room as they watched the familiar scene unfold from outside, the lonesome U.S. populace reportedly smiled wistfully as the Langhorne children ate their mother’s home-cooked meal, excitedly discussed their day at school, and playfully teased each other before heeding calls to settle down and finish their meals.“Looks like they’re having meat loaf tonight—that’s my favorite,” Minnesota resident Claire Gorman said as she and the rest of the nation’s citizenry watched Karen Langhorne pass a bowl of piping-hot mashed potatoes to her son.
