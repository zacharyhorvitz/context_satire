In a noteworthy departure from their usual shopping routine, the Dietrich family announced today that they would forego the regular mall near their home in favor of the good mall, located 45 minutes away.The good mall, which Dietrich household sources confirmed has the good stores, is reportedly "bigger" and "nicer" and worth the occasional trip, especially if the Macy's there is having a sale.
