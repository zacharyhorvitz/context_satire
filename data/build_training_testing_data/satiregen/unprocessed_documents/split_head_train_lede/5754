Hailing our day and age as the “single greatest moment in history to be a potato consumer,” National Potato Council president Dan Lake declared Tuesday that the United States is in the midst of an unparalleled potato renaissance.Drawing on his decades of experience as a celebrated cultivator, observer, and student of the root vegetable, Lake described “a great flourishing of the potato” across America, a profound phenomenon the likes of which we may never see again.“If you’ve been lucky enough to get your hands on a Yukon Gold or Red Thumb in the past few years, I needn’t tell you these are the halcyon days of the potato,” Lake said during his keynote address at the Idaho Potato Conference, stressing that he spoke not in his role as a potato representative, but as a connoisseur and human being.
