In what has reportedly become a daily routine on the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz stood alone in the center of his hotel suite Tuesday morning where he was carefully dressed and groomed by a swarm of loyal vermin.Cruz, wearing only dress socks and underwear, was said to have been suddenly covered head to toe by hundreds of rodents, worms, and insects, each of which was entrusted with a specific task to help prepare the presidential contender for an upcoming rally.
