In a joint statement confirming that all production would cease immediately, representatives from every Hollywood film studio announced Friday that audiences would not be given any new movies to watch until they had learned to appreciate the ones they already have.The declaration, which was endorsed by all working members of the industry, observed that there are plenty of existing films the American public doesn’t ever bother to watch, and explained that viewers would henceforth receive no new box-office openings and would simply have to make do with the current back catalog of movies.“There will be no more thrillers, comedies, or any of those sequels you’ve been asking for until you can show us you’re grateful for the more than 100 years of cinema we’ve already given you,” Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara told reporters, noting that Hollywood had made tens of thousands of titles for the U.S. populace, and yet it was always asking for more.
