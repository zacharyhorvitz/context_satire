Demonstrating how fully he had lost touch with reality, delusional man Jamie Farragut reportedly began turning off his laptop computer Tuesday at approximately 9:45 p.m. as if he were actually finished with it for the night.Sources said that despite not planning to go to bed for another hour, the 31-year-old legitimately believed he was done using the device, shutting open windows and quitting applications under the mentally unsound assumption he wouldn’t be using them again until morning.“I’m all caught up on my work emails, so I think I’ll just kick back on the couch and relax for a bit,” said the man deep in the throes of psychosis while closing several tabs—including Gmail, Instagram, and LinkedIn—that he currently had open in his browser.
