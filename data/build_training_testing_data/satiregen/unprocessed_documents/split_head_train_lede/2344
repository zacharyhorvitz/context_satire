Every member of local improvisational troupe “Calhoun” is balding, audience members observed Tuesday during the group’s 8 p.m. performance.According to sources, the group—which spent the majority of its 35-minute set playing various silly characters, doing outrageous voices, and pretending to be animals or members of the opposite sex—consists solely of adult males in their mid-to-late 30s who are either completely bald or have severely receded hairlines.“Great fucking set,” out-of-breath Calhoun member Daryl Crane said after the performance, sweat collecting in rills on his thin-haired scalp.
