Unable to recall a single instance in which their father mentioned any details about his early adulthood, the children of local man Alan Murphy confirmed Monday they had no idea what he was doing between the years of 1985 and 1988.During a conversation between siblings Sarah, Mark, and Jess Murphy, all now in their 20s, it reportedly became apparent that none of them had ever known their dad to discuss any jobs, friends, living arrangements, cars, or personal interests he might have had in the years between graduating from the University of California, Davis, in 1985 and meeting their mother in Boston in the fall of 1988.“Yeah, come to think of it, I don’t think I’ve even heard him tell one story about that time in his life,” said Jess Murphy, who acknowledged it hadn’t occurred to her until just now that the nearly four-year period of her father’s life was an absolute mystery to her.
