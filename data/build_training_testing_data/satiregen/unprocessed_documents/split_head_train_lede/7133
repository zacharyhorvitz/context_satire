According to sources currently seated in rows 14 through 18 aboard flight 763, two middle-aged men with incredibly boring jobs are really hitting it off during the three-hour trip to Kansas City.Using terms like “white-labeling” and “core clients,” the slightly overweight, average-looking men are reportedly engaged in a detailed discussion about overwhelmingly unexciting work-related topics and, sources said, seem to be getting along great.“They got to talking as soon as we boarded, and you could tell they just clicked right away,” said 31-year-old Nikki Bertrand of 16B, adding that one of the men, upon looking up from his sales trade magazine, immediately recognized the company logo on the polo shirt of the man sitting down in the next seat.
