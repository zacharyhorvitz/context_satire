In a bold move marking its first foray into the luxury market, restaurant and video arcade chain Dave & Buster’s announced Thursday the opening of David & Benedict’s, a new fine dining and gaming outpost in the Napa Valley region of Northern California.According to company spokespeople, the lavish yet tastefully modern Rem Koolhaas–designed gaming hall and gourmet eatery will feature an upscale amusement experience coupled with some of the latest and most exciting gastronomic innovations to be found in New American cuisine.“Guests of David & Benedict’s won’t just have a meal and play some games—they’ll be treated to a complete immersion of the senses,” said public relations director Diane Feng, touting the new restaurant’s solid mahogany Skee-Ball tables and epicurean dishes, which include the Benedict Burger, a deconstructed hamburger made from Japanese Wagyu beef suspended in a buffalo-sauce-infused marrow broth.
