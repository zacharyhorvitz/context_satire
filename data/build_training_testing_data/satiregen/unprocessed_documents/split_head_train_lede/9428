In a shocking revelation that has rocked Thomas E. Dewey High School, sources in Mrs. Trimble’s third-period English class confirmed this week that 17-year-old Jessica Milly will soon begin putting out.At approximately 10:15 a.m. Wednesday, Milly made the watershed announcement to Tanya Harris, her best friend since sixth grade, saying she planned on going all the way with her boyfriend of three months, Josh Gibson.“I didn’t think she’d put out until senior year at the earliest,” said classmate Eric Dobbratz, adding that the school’s entire male population was now far more optimistic about the potential of getting laid before graduation.
