Drawing on data gathered during the most recent decennial survey of the American populace, the U.S. Census Bureau announced Wednesday that the country is composed of more than 316 million complete nothings who do not matter in the least.“Based on our analysis, we can conclude that the United States is a broad patchwork of nobodies; a collection of hundreds of millions of insignificant data points who, across all demographic characteristics, share the common trait of being entirely unexceptional,” said Census Bureau director John H. Thompson at an afternoon press event, confirming that, from coast to coast and in both rural and urban locations, the population was nearly uniformly bland and inconsequential.
