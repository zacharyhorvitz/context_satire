Following the reported suicide of local teen Jenny Gordon, longtime bully Hannah Boucard, 17, told reporters Wednesday that she could not believe her classmate took four straight years of being told to kill herself seriously.Boucard, who reflected on the verbal and written assaults she had directed toward Gordon on a daily basis since first meeting her in 2011, confirmed that she was still shocked that her classmate could let over 2,000 suggestions to end her life get to her.“How was I supposed to know that sending a text every single morning saying the world would be better off if she died would be the type of thing she’d take personally?” said Boucard, adding that the recently deceased Gordon must have been a lot more sensitive than she thought.
