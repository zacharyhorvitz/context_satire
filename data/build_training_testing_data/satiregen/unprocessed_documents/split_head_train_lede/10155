Despite owning 15 units in the central Los Angeles area, landlord Marceline Brown can only count on receiving on-time rent payments from one of her tenants: full-time crack dealer Nathan “Buck” Cruz, 24.According to Brown, Cruz has never missed a rent deadline since moving into 1211 Juniette Street, Apartment 2D in October 2004, despite having no bank account, credit cards, or personal checks.“I couldn’t ask for a better tenant,” said Brown, 52, who praised Cruz for personally delivering his $950 monthly rent in cash.
