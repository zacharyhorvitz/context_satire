Saying the plot was jumping all over the place and had become extremely hard to follow, onlookers confirmed this afternoon that 7-year-old Brendan Milner has been unable to maintain a single cohesive storyline while playing with his action figures.By all accounts, the second-grader failed to adhere to any logical narrative arc, following one plotline for only a brief period of time before veering in wildly tangential directions as he acted out scenes with several of his favorite plastic toys, including the superhero Iron Man, the giant monster Godzilla, and professional wrestler John Cena.“I’ll get you for that,” said Milner, who violently slammed the figurine of Iron Man into the WWE World Heavyweight Champion toy and sent it flying across the living room, contradicting a scene from just moments earlier in which the pair were best friends searching for a magical crystal.
