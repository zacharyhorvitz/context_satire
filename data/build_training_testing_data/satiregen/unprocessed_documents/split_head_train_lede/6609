After years of unsuccessful efforts to establish itself as a center of tourism, industry or Texas history, the tiny East Texas town of Purley finally put itself on the map Monday, when civic leaders unveiled the world's largest fiberglass chili dog.The oversized wiener replica—centerpiece of Purley's campaign to become "Chili Dog Capital Of The World"—was christened at a ceremony attended by Purley's 233 residents, as well as reporters from as far away as Floyd County.
