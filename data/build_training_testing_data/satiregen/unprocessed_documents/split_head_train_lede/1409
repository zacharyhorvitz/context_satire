Matthew Jorgensen, a complete and total nerd who sources speculate likely has no tangible social life, actually both owns and regularly uses his own personal computer, reports from those with knowledge of Jorgensen’s geeky hobby confirmed Tuesday.Sources have confirmed that the 27-year-old dweeb not only uses the computing device itself regularly throughout the day, but has installed numerous “programs” on the gizmo that perform a number of tasks witnesses have described as “unbearably dorky.”“I see him come in every morning with this dumb little gizmo of his, and then he proceeds to spend literally all day pressing little buttons on his computer and ‘punching in data’ or whatever nerdy shit he’s doing with that thing,” coworker Mark Samson told reporters, stressing that the geek actually said the machine was essential to his daily routine.
