 has seen its fair share of pain and controversy over the years, but Rockstar has once again cemented their status as industry leaders by finally tackling one of its biggest issues with an all new eco-friendly feature: To help offset the city’s carbon emissions, the game’s developers will plant an in-game tree for every mile you drive.“Rockstar has always been committed to the sustainability of our in-game world, and that’s why we’re launching all-new features like planting a tree for every mile driven, adding solar panels to the roofs of fast-food restaurants and strip clubs, and turning the Tongva Valley into an official wilderness preserve,” Rockstar spokesperson Michael DeVine told OGN, explaining that the development team went to great lengths to ensure the state of San Andreas scales back its environmental footprint, whether that means prioritizing carpooling or even holding green funerals for every person you kill.
