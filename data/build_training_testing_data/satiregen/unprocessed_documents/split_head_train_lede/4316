In an attempt to address the troubling number of genetic transformations occurring in workplaces across the nation, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration unveiled new regulations this week aimed at reducing on-the-job mutations, sources confirmed.While the revised precautions, inspection procedures, and training requirements apply to all places of work, those facilities that engage in bioengineering, pharmaceutical development, hazardous waste processing, and nuclear energy—industries that have all recently seen a sharp uptick in employees sprouting tentacles and compound eyes—are expected to be impacted most by the new protocols.“No one should have to go to work worried they’ll come home with the head of a Venus flytrap.”“Over the past several years, we’ve seen far too many workers suddenly develop antennae, multiple limbs, and other insect-like features, prompting us to institute this range of new safety measures,” OSHA assistant secretary of labor David Michaels said during a press conference, later stressing that compliance with the new rules and screening procedures will protect the American workforce from developing scaly armadillo-like plates in place of their skin as a result of being exposed to toxic materials.
