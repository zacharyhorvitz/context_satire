Moving swiftly and discreetly like CIA field agents on some kind of black-ops mission to infiltrate a terrorist cell in a hostile country, coworkers of soon-to-be 29-year-old Catherine Greyson clandestinely passed a birthday card around the office of Rhodes Insurance Corp. on Friday, sources confirmed.Furtively weaving in and out of cubicles like spies trying to evade capture after killing a high-value target deep behind enemy lines, employees took turns writing personalized greetings and signing the floral-patterned card, which, like a silenced 9 mm pistol, was kept carefully out of sight.“Shh, this is for Catherine,” whispered marketing assistant Greg Carmichael, looking over both shoulders as though preparing to leave a thumb drive inside a hollowed-out park bench.
