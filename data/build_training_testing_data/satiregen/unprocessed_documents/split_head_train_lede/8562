A time-honored tradition ended in calamity tonight when, less than an hour after presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Barack Obama gathered together in the town of Hempstead, NY to debate their political views before villagers, a lantern tipped over and set fire to the ol’ Town Hall.According to sources, the fire broke out when a mare kicked over an old kerosene lamp, quickly lighting wooden pews aflame and igniting haystacks in the town’s historic gathering place, which for centuries has served as the center of social, spiritual, and political life for the people of Hempstead.“Come quick, there’s a fire down at the ol’ Town Hall!” local schoolteacher Eunice Quinn shouted into the cobblestone streets as the blaze spread through the building’s storage chambers, burning up the surplus of dry goods and preserved fruits that had been safely stored away for the harsh winter months.
