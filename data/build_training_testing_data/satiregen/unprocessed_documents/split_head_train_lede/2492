Heralding the discovery as the most complete specimen of its kind, a team of archaeologists from the University of Iowa announced Thursday that they had managed to reconstruct more than 75 percent of a Snyder’s of Hanover pretzel from fragments found at a Des Moines–area Stop ’N Go.According to researchers, the pretzel—the remains of which were discovered scattered across three spaces in the store’s parking lot, with secondary sites found just inside the automatic doors and underneath the hot dog roller grill—has required thousands of man-hours to painstakingly collect and categorize, and is the most thorough reconstruction of a baked snack to date.“We knew we had something special when we found the largely intact section of the pretzel’s upper-left arc, but it wasn’t until we arranged it alongside several smaller fragments that we realized just how significant this find was,” said lead researcher Dr. Brian Michener, describing the process by which his team methodically mapped and staked off the nearly 30-square-foot expanse of asphalt across which most of the snack’s remains were spread.
