Announcing a new business deal between the online media website and a major national advertiser Tuesday, Flux Media CEO Rich Lange reportedly described the wholesale disavowal of his company’s longstanding core values in exchange for ad sales revenue as a “brand partnership.” “Flux is a proud leader in delivering fresh, original content to readers, and we’re pleased to work alongside our new partner Checkers Drive-In restaurants,” said Lange in a company-wide email, describing an upcoming series of integrated on-site advertisements that will fully erode the company’s integrity in the eyes of both its employees and readers as “an exciting, innovative new venture.” “Checkers Drive-In is committed to working closely with our brand as we continue to produce the best, most relevant content on the internet, and I’m sure this is just the start of a long, productive, and mutually beneficial relationship.” At press time, sources reported that the company had taken additional steps toward completely eradicating its founding principles and any remaining shred of self-respect by promising to “evolve [its] business model” over the coming year.
