In one of the biggest entertainment scandals of the year, Mel Gibson, more than a decade after the fact, still has not received the critical acclaim he deserves for his powerful yet nuanced performance in the 1999 action-thriller .Playing the role of Porter, a street-smart ex-Marine who plots revenge after being shot by his best friend and junkie wife and left to die, Gibson treats audiences to 100 minutes of pure edge-of-your seat drama, a feat that somehow failed to garner a single Oscar nod or a spot on AFI's top-100 list.
