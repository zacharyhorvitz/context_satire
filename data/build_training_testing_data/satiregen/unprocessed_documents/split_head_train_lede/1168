A new study published Tuesday by Emory University determined that 89 percent of networking encounters occur forcibly and without the consent of one of the parties involved, a disturbing finding that suggests far more people are victims of unwanted career-related discussions than was previously thought.The study, which examined data from 1,400 abusive incidents in which individuals were compelled against their will to assist another's professional ambitions and "talk shop," also incorporated interviews with dozens who were violated by acts of nonconsensual networking, many of whom described similarly traumatic and dehumanizing experiences.
