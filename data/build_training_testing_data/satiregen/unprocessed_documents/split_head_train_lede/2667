During a press conference Thursday at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, leading members of the scientific community confirmed that despite decades of research, the best available theoretical models still cannot predict more than one upcoming Tetris block.While they have long possessed the technology to accurately forecast and display which of the seven distinct Tetris shapes, or tetrominoes, will appear next, scientists told reporters they’ve so far had no success determining what any of the blocks beyond the immediate successor will be.“Modern supercomputers have now reached speeds of 30 quadrillion calculations per second, but even with all that processing power, we’re no closer to solving this problem than we were a generation ago,” said MIT professor Michael Haemlin, who has studied tetromino sequencing since 1984.
