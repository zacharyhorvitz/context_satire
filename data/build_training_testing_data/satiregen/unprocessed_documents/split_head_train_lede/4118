Diane Hamm, 38, a lifelong Spencer resident and part-time clerical assistant at Groelke Home Financing in nearby Plovis, was not listened to yet again Tuesday, when her husband paid no attention to what she was saying as she handed him the morning newspaper.Officials estimate that the incident marks roughly the 10 billionth time Hamm has not been listened to when attempting to speak.
