Saying there was “no escape, no escape at all” from the deadly pathogens, disheveled Centers for Disease Control director Robert R. Redfield warned the nation Thursday from inside a sterilized plastic bubble that “invisible germs are crawling absolutely everywhere.”Redfield, who sported a long, unkempt beard and wore a filthy suit as he held a press conference within a hermetically sealed office at the CDC headquarters, urged Americans to avoid all areas to which the virulent and highly contagious microbes are likely to have spread, including schools, offices, shopping centers, restaurants, places of worship, the entirety of the outdoors, and even one’s own home.“Initial findings indicate we are in the midst of a full-blown outbreak of imperceptible germs swarming over every conceivable surface, which is why I am calling on the federal government to declare a state of emergency,” said Redfield, pausing briefly in his prepared remarks as his gnarled, 6-inch-long fingernails seemed to cause him some difficulty with flipping to his next notecard.
