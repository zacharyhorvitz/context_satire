In a deal that spared him capital punishment for his alleged orchestration of the 9/11 attacks, former al-Qaeda operative Khalid Sheikh Mohammed reluctantly accepted a judge’s alternative sentence requiring him to coach a disorderly youth baseball team, sources confirmed Wednesday.A court brief made public this week has revealed that last year, federal judge Jonathan Ward ordered Mohammed to manage the 0-6 Rockets of the Sayville, Long Island, Little League for 60 days, saying that he hoped the onetime terrorist network leader might be able to learn some valuable lessons by working with the troubled but pugnacious 12-year-olds.The team had developed a reputation in the league for poor play and mischievous behavior, local sources said, and were in desperate need of a coach after their previous three quit in frustration.“All right, guys, let’s get something straight—I don’t want to be here, and you don’t want to be here, so let’s just try to get this season over with,” the organizer of the deadliest terror attack in modern history reportedly said when first meeting the rambunctious youngsters in their overgrown practice field, where trash can lids were used as bases and the entire team was sharing a single worn-out ball.
