According to friends and family, the automobile accident that claimed the life of area youth Evan Laskin this week tragically cut short the prospects of a talented 18-year-old who had aspired his whole life to be a living person.Those closest to him said Laskin would be remembered not only as a loving son and caring friend, but also as a gifted young man who, right up until the very end, showed tremendous promise when it came to being alive.“His whole life, Evan wanted nothing more than to exist,” said Bryan Dermott, a classmate and close friend of Laskin who shared his ambition to have a functioning central nervous system.
