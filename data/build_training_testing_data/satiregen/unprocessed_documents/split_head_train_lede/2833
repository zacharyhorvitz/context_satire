Playfully ribbing the group of journalists who had filed into the bare concrete room for the event, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reportedly addressed a crowded prison mess hall during Iran’s annual press correspondents’ dinner Thursday night.According to sources, the supreme leader of Iran stood at a podium in the cafeteria at Tehran’s Evin prison and delivered a lighthearted monologue in which he poked fun at a number of the press corps veterans in attendance, but also took time to recognize the seriousness of the work that had brought them to where they are today.“Thank you all for coming out tonight,” Khamenei said to the gathering of Iran’s most accomplished reporters and bloggers, who were dressed for the occasion in prison-issued blue uniforms and gray blindfolds.
