Millions of Americans and thousands of federal employees awoke Monday to find the national mail service in disarray after a group of rowdy teens on a joyride reportedly destroyed up to 90 percent of the postal serviceâ€™s nationwide infrastructure with a baseball bat.Citing more than $45 billion in damages from the late-night escapade, the United States Postal Service has suspended all mail delivery and requested relief aid to rebuild more than 650 demolished post offices.
