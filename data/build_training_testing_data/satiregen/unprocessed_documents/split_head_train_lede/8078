Saying that he’s been “wondering how much cheddar he could squeeze out of Old Man Abolitionist for a while now,” renowned historian David McCullough told reporters Friday that he’s strongly considering writing a biography of the famed social reformer and statesman Frederick Douglass.The 80-year-old Pulitzer Prize–winning author, widely hailed as the country’s preeminent historian for his biographies of American presidents and historical nonfiction works such as  and , revealed his recent interest in “scaring up some of that sweet paper” out of Douglass “like [he] did with the Founding Fathers gravy train.”“I’m really starting to think about how I could rattle a few clams out of Frederick Douglass’ life story,” McCullough said, noting that “the well’s certainly been tapped before, but I doubt that baby’s dry.” “Freddy D always sells, but when you consider the fact that we’ve got a black guy in office right now, you’re looking at a zeitgeist factor that could spell some serious cabbage.”“It’s not like John Adams hadn’t been covered, and I rode him like a rodeo straight to the bank,” McCullough added.
