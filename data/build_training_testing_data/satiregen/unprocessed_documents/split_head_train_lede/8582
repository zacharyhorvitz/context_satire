U.S. paleontologists reportedly unearthed a nearly intact skeleton of a Spazosaurus Tuesday, an extraordinary discovery providing evidence indicating that the awkward, uncoordinated, and peculiar creature was the largest doofus to ever roam the earth.Preston Hopkins, the lead paleontologist at the excavation site, analyzed the fossilized remains and attributed the skeletonâ€™s stooped posture, gangly neck, and misshapen skull with a significant overbite to that of a Spazosaurus.
