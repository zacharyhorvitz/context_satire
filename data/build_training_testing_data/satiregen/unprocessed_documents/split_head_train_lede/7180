Unleashing a brutal wave of violence and destruction that has upended the entire power structure of the entertainment industry overnight, the nation’s C-list celebrities have carried out a bloody coup to overthrow the hottest stars in Hollywood, sources reported Tuesday.Armed hordes of lesser-known actors—who rampaged from studio to studio, setting fire to everything in their path and leaving the dismembered bodies of their A-list counterparts scattered across Los Angeles County—reportedly rose up and revolted after years of being passed over for leading roles, denied awards, and generally ignored by the media in favor of those with greater name recognition.“We’ve tried to contain the damage, but much of the city is in flames, and a marauding faction, which appears to be led by actor Taye Diggs, is now in complete control of the area from Sunset Boulevard all the way down to Pico,” said L.A. police chief Charlie Beck, adding that the carnage began Monday when a contingent of actors from the TNT show  stormed the Ivy Restaurant in West Hollywood and began slitting the throats of top-tier celebrities.
