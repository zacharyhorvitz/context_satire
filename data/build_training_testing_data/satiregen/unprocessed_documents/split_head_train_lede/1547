According to sources within the Bennett household, a short-haired and utterly doomed rabbit named Oreo was recently purchased in order to teach the family’s 8-year-old son, Toby, about patience and responsibility.The ill-fated, 6-pound pet, which parents John and Kathryn Bennett had hoped would foster cognitive, social, and emotional growth in their child, is reportedly condemned to perish in less than two months from a combination of negligence and abuse.“Toby is going to learn so many valuable lessons by taking care of Oreo,” Kathryn Bennett said of the hopeless creature soon to be subjected to increasingly unlivable conditions without any means of escape, until the morose rabbit dies prematurely and is buried in the backyard.
