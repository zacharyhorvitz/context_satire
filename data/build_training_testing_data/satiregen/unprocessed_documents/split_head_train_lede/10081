Saying he’s seen “a lot of people come through here in [his] day” and met prisoners of every type, longtime Louisiana State Penitentiary death row guard Dwayne McFadden confided Wednesday that he’s always had a bit of a soft spot for the innocent ones.While the 57-year-old corrections officer said he strives to remain detached and professional when dealing with inmates awaiting execution, he told reporters that, invariably, the men convicted of capital crimes they didn’t commit somehow always manage to find a way into his heart, remaining there even after they are put to death.“When you’ve been here as long as I have, you start to develop a special relationship with the guys who aren’t actually guilty,” said McFadden, noting that there have been so many such inmates during his 30 years on the job he has lost exact count.
