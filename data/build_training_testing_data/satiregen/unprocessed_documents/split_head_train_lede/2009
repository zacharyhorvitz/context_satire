After starting at the company just three weeks ago, 22-year-old Wenger Marketing intern Allison Bennett told reporters Thursday that she has already befriended 36-year-old digital content coordinator Mike Fryer, the least-respected employee in the entire office.“I’m still pretty new and don’t know many people, but Mike really went out of his way to welcome me here,” Bennett said of the consistently marginalized man whose meager contributions to the company are not at all valued by any of his 60 coworkers.
