Claiming that the dilapidated, sun-bleached recreational facility had been on its last legs for years, local residents told reporters Monday that this has to be the summer that the Putt King miniature golf course on Route 22 finally closes its doors.“I honestly have no idea how that place has stayed in business—I don’t think I’ve seen one car in its parking lot in the last five or six years,” said Whitehall resident Kevin Forenza, 22, who claimed the miniature golf course had been “sad and run-down” as long as he could remember.
