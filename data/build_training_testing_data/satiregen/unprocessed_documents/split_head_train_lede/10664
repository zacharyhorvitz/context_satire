Enjoying a beautiful evening and building memories they would likely cherish for years to come, the nation’s limo drivers spent a magical prom night playing scratch-off lotto tickets in darkened parking lots across the country Saturday, sources confirmed.Numerous reports indicate the drivers, dressed handsomely in their least-wrinkled shirts and ties, savored the magnificent galas by blowing through stacks of tic-tac-toe-themed instant games and $1,000-a-week-for-life scratch cards during just the first of several splendid hours they spent patiently waiting in their vehicles.“I bought a couple Moola Moolas and Cherry Triplers, and I also got one of those $5 ones,” said M & J Transportation driver Arnold Hauser of Cincinnati, who reportedly also occupied himself through a large portion of the spectacular soiree by resting his head against the driver’s-side window while half-listening to a radio broadcast of the Reds game.
