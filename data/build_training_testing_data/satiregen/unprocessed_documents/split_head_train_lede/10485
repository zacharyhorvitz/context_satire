Local woman and Helios Network Solutions sales manager Patricia Carson reportedly received astute counsel from a veritable legal dream team of coworkers Tuesday, who dispensed invaluable advice on how to get out of a recent speeding ticket.The elite legal brain trust, composed of five colleagues who gathered around Carson’s cubicle as she recounted receiving a $120 traffic citation the previous evening, reportedly drew on their comprehensive knowledge of the judicial system to map out an ironclad courtroom strategy that would allow Carson, 35, to successfully contest her ticket.“That’s bullshit; you should totally fight it,” said Helios junior marketing director Gregory Castle, widely regarded as one of the legal community’s preeminent scholars, upon learning that Carson had been assessed a moving violation for allegedly driving 10 miles per hour faster than the posted speed limit.
