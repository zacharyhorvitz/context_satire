Having long assumed he and his four closest friends from college were simply drifting apart as they got older, local 30-year-old Brian Paulson told reporters Wednesday he has slowly come to realize he is the only member of the group losing touch with the others.Paulson, who shared a five-bedroom apartment with Erik Bannen, Stephen Leona, Adam Kurtz, and Jason Lu during his last three years at the University of Virginia, said that after seeing a recent photo of his four “best buds” together on Facebook, he began to understand his core group of college friends was not, in fact, falling out of contact.“I figured everyone had kind of gone their own way and had just gradually grown more distant since graduation, but apparently I’m the only one who’s done that,” said Paulson, who explained he had been under the false impression that his friends saw as little of each other these days as he sees of them until clicking on an album labeled “Camping + Rafting” on Kurtz’s Facebook profile.
