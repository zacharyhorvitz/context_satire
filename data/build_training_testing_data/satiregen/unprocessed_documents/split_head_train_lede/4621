Emphasizing the short billion-mile trip from the ringed planet’s metro center to the historic and oft-overlooked locale, the solar system’s real estate agents have begun trying to attract home buyers to the neglected, run-down planet of Earth by renaming it “West Saturn.” “It’s obviously not the quietest or most scenic area, with its increasingly finicky weather and single moon, but it’s obviously in the same solar system as Saturn and fairly close to Proxima Centauri, Epsilon Eridani, and a ton of other really great spots in the Milky Way,” said broker Sally Mansfield while hastily trotting an interested buyer past one of Earth’s more squalid subcontinents, assuring them not to worry as they would spend most of their time on Saturn anyway.
