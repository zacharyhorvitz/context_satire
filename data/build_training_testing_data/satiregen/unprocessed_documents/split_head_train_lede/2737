Planning ahead to ensure he is adequately prepared for life after college, Ohio University senior Kyle Huber confirmed to reporters Monday that he already has an excruciating 14-month employment search lined up and waiting for him when he graduates this spring.The marketing major stated that, far from exiting school without a clear direction or goal in mind, he has prepared himself to “hit the ground running” right away with a prolonged, demoralizing, and desperate job hunt.“Once I get my diploma this spring, I’m pretty much all set to begin this new, dispiriting chapter in my life on the right foot,” said Huber, who confirmed that he already has firm plans to move to a city where he’ll live with five roommates in a small apartment while hopelessly chasing down leads on unappealing dead-end positions he isn’t qualified for anyway.
