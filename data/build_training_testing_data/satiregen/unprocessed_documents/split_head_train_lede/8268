Saying he will be shocked and saddened by the statements of his party’s presidential nominee, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday the comments Donald Trump will make over the next several months are “highly regrettable.” “I want to make clear that the remarks Donald Trump will say in the weeks ahead are unfortunate and do not reflect the views of the Republican Party,” said Ryan, who noted that while he did not agree with the “harmful and divisive” language Trump would choose to use between now and the election, he believed he could work with the candidate to enact a strong conservative platform.
