U.S. Bureau of Departmental Operations secretary Helen Lastrom, 38, is slated to personalize her workplace, a six-foot square cubicle delineated by three grayish-brown office dividers, in the Bureau’s Minneapolis office this week.Her plans include the adornment of the divider, desk and computer monitor’s outer edges with items intended to “brighten” the workplace and remind her of friends, good times and family, or just to make her laugh.“I enjoy humor,” Lastrom said.Lastrom was hired by the Bureau last week after passing civil service test 12E, which increased her rating class and qualified her for one-level caste promotion.
