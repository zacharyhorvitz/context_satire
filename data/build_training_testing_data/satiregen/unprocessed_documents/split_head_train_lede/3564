In a highly disappointing development expected to put a damper on the entire holiday weekend, sources within the Cunningham family confirmed Tuesday that none of the good cousins are coming to this year’s Thanksgiving gathering.“Mom said Uncle Larry and Aunt Jan are staying in Rochester, which means [cousins] Tyler and Lauren won’t be here,” said Sara Cunningham, 14, noting the out-of-town relatives’ absence would make the upcoming get-together in Schenectady the first Thanksgiving in recent memory not to include even one of the good cousins.
