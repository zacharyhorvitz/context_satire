Sources confirmed Monday that Britain’s most senior Roman Catholic cleric, Cardinal Keith O’Brien, has stepped down from his position as Archbishop of St. Andrews and Edinburgh due to—you’re not going to believe this one—sexual abuse allegations.According to reports, O’Brien resigned amid the surfacing of claims that he, a high-ranking member of the church, had made—huge shocker here—inappropriate sexual advances toward numerous male subordinates over many years.Sexual abuse, sources confirmed, in the Catholic Church of all places.“Cardinal O’Brien has tendered his resignation following, and I know this comes as a bombshell, allegations that he made a series of unwanted physical and verbal overtures directed at young men under his purview,” said archdiocese representative Thomas Heron, referring to claims lodged by four former and current priests that the Scottish archbishop sexually harassed them over several years.
