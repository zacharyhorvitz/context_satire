In a move that has shaken the already fragile publishing industry, struggling retail giant Fox Books officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Wednesday, sources confirmed.Once known as the “Big Bad Wolf” for its ability to put independent bookstores out of business by wooing customers with its sharp discounts and designer coffee, Fox Books is now reportedly listed as $1.74 billion in debt and owes over $190 million to various book vendors.“For decades, our goal was to seduce our customers,” company CEO Joe Fox told reporters while standing outside his houseboat.
