Shedding new light on one of the most influential leaders in American history, Yale University historians released a report Thursday that suggests White House officials deliberately hid President Franklin Roosevelt’s mechanical spider legs from the public.The report, which draws upon a recently discovered trove of photographs, state documents, and personal journals, describes a coordinated effort by top aides to conceal the fact that the 32nd president relied on a set of eight hydraulically powered cast-iron legs to skitter about during the last two decades of his life.“Roosevelt’s advisers feared voters of the time would never elect a man whose lower extremities had been replaced with an intricate system of spider-like appendages,” said report co-author Stephen Elmore, who noted that during FDR’s first campaign for governor of New York, his staff began to disguise the 4-foot-long triple-jointed prostheses that he had custom-designed to regain mobility after becoming paralyzed in 1921.
