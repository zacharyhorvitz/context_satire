Saying he no longer feels like just another face in the crowd, local seventh-grader Evan Christiano told reporters Thursday that since transferring to Crystal Springs Preparatory from the public middle school he attended last year, he has received far more one-on-one bullying.“At my old school, my bullies hardly even seemed to notice me,” said Christiano, explaining that the smaller class sizes at his new private school give bullies the opportunity to better familiarize themselves with each student’s weaknesses and develop individualized plans for addressing them.
