Days after being admitted to the clinic’s intensive care unit, physicians at Greenwich Hospital relayed Thursday the improving condition of Invictus Mutual Funds CEO Charles Latham, 67, a man whose grand delusion of self-importance is the only thing keeping him alive at this point, doctors confirmed.“While Mr. Latham is suffering from a severe bout of pneumonia that in most cases would be classified as terminal, his unparalleled egomania has enabled him to fight off the infection,” said pulmonary disease specialist Dr. Henry Calhoun, who admitted he had never before seen such an inflated sense of self-worth in a patient.
