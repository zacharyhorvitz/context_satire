Ensuring he would be exposed to minimal amounts of advertisements and downtime in his entertainment, local man Eric Sackett carefully settled on a backup channel to watch whenever AMC’s airing of the film  entered a commercial break, sources confirmed Friday.Sackett told reporters he stumbled upon the film 15 minutes into its airing and immediately began searching for a secondary program the moment an advertisement appeared on-screen, eventually determining that a block of  episodes on the Discovery Channel represented his best fallback position for the next three hours.“Usually ESPN is my go-to backup, but  was ending soon, and I didn’t want to watch the college basketball game that was on next,” said Sackett, who reportedly shrank  into picture-in-picture mode as he scanned the digital guide for a program he would enjoy viewing every 15 to 20 minutes.
