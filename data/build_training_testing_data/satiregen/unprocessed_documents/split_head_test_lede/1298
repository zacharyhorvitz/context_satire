ATLANTA–CNN officials announced Tuesday that the cable network is “making good progress” in its ongoing effort to release the vast backlog of news accumulated during Elián González’s headline-dominating seven-month odyssey in the U.S. “Ever since little Elián went back to Cuba on June 28, we’ve been working overtime to get through all the news we bumped during that gripping, emotional saga,” CNN vice-president Susan Bunda said.
