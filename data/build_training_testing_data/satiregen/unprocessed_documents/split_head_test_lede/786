A host of high-ranking insect leaders convened in Canada for the annual G20,000,000,000 summit Friday, addressing various challenges facing today’s insects and promoting stability among the global bug population.The two-day conference, held this year in a secluded, heavily wooded area of the Ottawa National Forest, reportedly includes various insect representatives from North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as over 15,000 different species of beetles from Australia invited as non-member delegates.“The decisions made at the G20,000,000,000 will greatly affect all 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 insects around the world,” said John Cavagnaro, chair of the International Society of Entomology.
