Describing an astounding variety of naturalists previously unknown to science, a team of ecologists from Stanford University announced Friday the discovery of more than 400 species of Charles Darwin living in the Gal√°pagos Islands.The Darwins, which researchers said have evolved to fill a staggering array of ecological niches throughout the archipelago, appear to have developed dramatically varied biological structures through the process of speciation, exhibiting beard lengths, for example, that range from closely cropped in some species to past the knee in others.
