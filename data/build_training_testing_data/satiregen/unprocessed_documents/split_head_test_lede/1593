Coming together for the first time in generations, Palestinian and Israeli citizens were reportedly seen gathered at the West Bank today mocking President Obama’s hopelessly naive speech proposing the possibility of a two-state solution.According to sources, members of both sides of the longstanding conflict united in fits of laughter and sarcastic applause at what they called an “extremely impractical” and “actually pretty hilarious” address.“Give me a fucking break,” said Palestinian citizen Hassan Tannous, 42, who, along with Israeli man Dov Eshel, rolled his eyes after Obama claimed that an independent Palestinian state is a viable and sustainable option.
