Calling it a privilege to work in such a dynamic and collaborative environment, NASA social media manager Dustin Greer, 26, told reporters Wednesday he considers himself fortunate to be a part of the space agency’s team.Greer, who for the past four years has helped to maintain NASA’s official Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram accounts, is said to go about his job each day under the impression that, as social media manager, he is one of the thousands of men and women working tirelessly to advance humankind’s exploration of outer space.“Every day at NASA, we’re conducting groundbreaking research and making new discoveries, and it feels incredible being part of something so critical to the future of our society,” said Greer, whose job consists of uploading images, copying and pasting text, shortening links to stay under Twitter’s 140-character limit, and responding to comments online.
