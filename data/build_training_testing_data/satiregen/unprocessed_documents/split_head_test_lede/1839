Modern science achieved a major breakthrough Tuesday, when researchers at Duke University's prestigious Non-Prescription Research Laboratory used a high-tech, $55 million backache-imaging system to definitively prove that Doan's pills really work.According to scientists at the laboratory, the "BakMap880" holographic back-pain imaging system can literally "track" the pathway of an individual Doan's pill through the human body, mapping its pain-relief dispersal pattern and depicting the backache itself as it is soothed and relieved.
