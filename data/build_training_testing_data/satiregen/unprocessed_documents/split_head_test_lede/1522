In an annual ritual that has long heralded the changing of seasons, thousands of geese have left their native breeding grounds across North America and begun to head south, taking to the skies in droves as they migrate to actor Andy García’s house for the winter.Each year, seeking to escape harsh weather, numerous varieties of Canada geese, snow geese, greater white-fronted geese, and cackling geese fatten up on vegetation in their natural habitats until they are plump enough to fly the thousands of miles necessary to reach the friendlier climes of the Academy Award nominee’s 6,747-square-foot Spanish-style hacienda in Toluca Lake, CA.“While we do not yet fully understand the phenomenon, we do know these geese are born with an instinctual ability to find their way to Andy García’s house year after year, without fail,” Cornell University ornithologist Martin Copeland said Thursday, noting that the migratory pattern dates back at least two decades, to García’s purchase of the house from fellow actor Henry Winkler in 1993.
