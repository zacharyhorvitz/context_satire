Saying they were becoming closed-off adults right before his very eyes, local father Peter Halfon, 49, described to reporters Wednesday his continued amazement at how quickly his kids are growing distant.Halfon, who said he is unable to believe how cold his 18-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son have gotten, reluctantly admitted to reporters that the years when his children spent all day playing, laughing, and acknowledging his existence seemed to pass in a heartbeat.“You always hear people talk about how quickly kids grow detached, but you never really understand until you’re actually a parent,” said Halfon, explaining that he always knew his children would not remain little kids who cared what he had to say forever, but hardly anticipated the changes happening so abruptly.
