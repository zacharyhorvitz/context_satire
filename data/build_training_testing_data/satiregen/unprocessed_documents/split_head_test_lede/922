Providing insight into the process by which the company creates its wildly successful line of health-oriented snacks, KIND Bar CEO Daniel Lubetzky admitted Friday that company personnel “just sort of find the bars like that.” “Our factory isn’t so much a traditional production facility as it is a wholesomeness-forward foraging site,” said Lubetzky, explaining that his employees more or less just pick up the bars of pressed, honey-bonded fruits, nuts, and grains as they appear on the ground.
