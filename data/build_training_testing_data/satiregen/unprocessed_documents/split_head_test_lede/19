Saying he feels destined for something different than his Lamborghini-driving, Dom Pérignon–guzzling peers, 17-year-old Jean-François Cambora told reporters Tuesday he doesn’t want to be a Monaco townie forever, stuck in the European city-state living the all-too-common life of a cosmopolitan playboy.“Look at my friends—in 10 years they’ll probably all still be here, still living in their parents’ mansions, racing Formula One cars on the professional circuit, spending their days just sailing around on one of their 150-foot mega yachts,” said Cambora, predicting that few if any of his classmates would ever hold down a full-time job.
