Representatives from Olay skin products confirmed Monday that their new skin cream does something, like “something that has to do with aging, or smoothness, or some other skin thing.”“You apply it, and it makes your skin good,” said Olay spokeswoman Christina Lowell, adding that the new skin cream more than likely does stuff with “skin tone and has a bunch of vitamins and minerals or whatever.” “Basically, if you have some skin that isn’t good and you want it to be good you should get this new cream and rub it into the not-good part of the skin.
