Citing both having to work early the next morning and several other inconveniences presented by a recent party invitation, local swingers Doug and Tiffany Finsky told reporters Wednesday that there is no way they are driving all the way out to goddamn Oakdale.According to the sexually adventurous couple, traveling to the event that their friends Linda and Joe Tremaine are hosting in the Minneapolis suburb over an hour’s drive from the Finskys’ home would likely not be worth the hassle, with the pair stating they would probably end up spending more time sitting in the car than they would at the party.“Sorry, not gonna happen—we’re just not driving all the way out there on a weeknight,” said Doug, 46, expressing his frustration that it would be “80 damn miles round-trip” and probably run him $15 or more in gas costs.
