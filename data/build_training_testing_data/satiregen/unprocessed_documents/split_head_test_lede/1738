Refusing to be denied victory by the 22-year-old intern blocking home plate, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton bowled over the opposing team’s catcher to score the winning run in her campaign staff’s softball game Sunday, sources confirmed.The afternoon matchup, held between members of the Clinton campaign as a brief break from the grind of the election season, reportedly came to an end in the bottom of the ninth inning when Clinton sprinted down the third-base line and lowered her shoulder into the chest of the young catcher as he attempted to tag her for the final out.
