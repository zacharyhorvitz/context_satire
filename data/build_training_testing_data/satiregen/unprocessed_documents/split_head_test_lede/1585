Organizers reported Sunday that the 44th White House Carnival was a rousing success, raising a record $800,000,066,845 for the federal government—$800 billion of which came from a dunk tank featuring former vice president Dick Cheney.According to Secretary of the Treasury and carnival volunteer Timothy Geithner, the 5-foot-deep tank has provided a much-needed boost to the nation’s flagging economy.“We expected a big turn out, but this is unbelievable,” said Geithner, adding that it’s tradition for the outgoing vice president to work the dunk tank.
