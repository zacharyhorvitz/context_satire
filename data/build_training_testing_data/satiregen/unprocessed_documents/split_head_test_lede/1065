A 150 percent increase in teen pregnancy rates over the past decade has led more high schools to eliminate “Fuck Your Brains Out,” a national sexual education program that encourages adolescents to have sex frequently and with as many partners as possible, sources confirmed Thursday.The federally funded program, whose mission is to “educate teens on the advantages of premarital sex and empower them to embrace a promiscuous lifestyle of banging the shit out of each other,” has reportedly contributed significantly to the spread of sexually transmitted infections and diseases among U.S. high school students.“We tried the ‘Fuck Your Brains Out’ initiative for five years, and unfortunately, we did not find the results we were looking for,” said Principal Lynn Mullen of Conestoga High School in Pennsylvania, one of 4,000 public secondary schools currently teaching the course.
