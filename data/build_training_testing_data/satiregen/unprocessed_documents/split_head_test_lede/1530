Saying the institution is notorious for the incidents of extreme violence that take place within its walls, sources confirmed Wednesday that the Marion County Correctional Center is home to Florida’s most dangerous and hardened population of prison guards.Officials from the state’s Department of Corrections told reporters that the maximum-security facility is occupied by its cruelest and longest-serving officers, men with documented histories of ruthlessness, uncontrollable bouts of rage, and an apparent inability to feel empathy of any kind.“The guards in here are some of the most disturbed individuals you will find in the American penal system,” said warden James Uphorn, remarking that the hostile behavior of employees under his administration has created an atmosphere of fear and unpredictable retribution throughout the prison.
