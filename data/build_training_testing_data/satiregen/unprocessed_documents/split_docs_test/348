 Voters in California will have the opportunity in November to say the state should be carved up into three parts. Three Californias is the ballot initiative pipe dream of a Golden State venture capitalist. Congress, however, will never sign on. But ...  Maine voters will conduct a groundbreaking democratic experiment on Tuesday when they use, for the first time in the nation, ranked choice voting in statewide primaries. The consequences of Maine's experiment could be momentous, with the potential to change campaigns, enliven third-party candidacies, and if successful, serve as proof-of-concept for the system at scale. The system was adopted through a voter referendum in 2016 and has survived a series of legal challenges in the intervening years, while emerging as a flashpoint in the state's politics. Here's how it works, according to the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting, which helped campaign for the referendum: "Ranked choice voting gives you the power to rank candidates from your favorite to your least favorite.  People from Maine (Mainers or Maineiacs -- either is acceptable) have been outraged at the election of Governor Paul LePage for many years, with bumper stickers dotting the state, with simply "61%." This sticker was created after LePage won the governorship with only 38% of the vote in 2010, the third lowest non-independent gubernatorial win since 1990. The bumper sticker was a way to signify that the person was part of a large majority that didn't vote the governor into office. On Tuesday evening, Mainers voted to veto the state legislature and immediately implement ranked choice voting, a measure that would allow voters to rank the candidates they would like in office.
