Earlier I had asked Carl if those putative extraterrestrials of a billion years from now could conceivably interpret the brain waves of a meditator. Who knows? A billion years is a long, long time, was his reply. On the chance that it might be possible why don't we give it a try? The Voyager 1 probe is currently the farthest human-made object from Earth. Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have reached interstellar space, the region between stars where the galactic plasma is present. Like their predecessors Pioneer 10 and 11, which featured a simple plaque, both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were launched by NASA with a message aboardâ€”a kind of time capsule, intended to communicate to extraterrestrials a story of the world of humans on Earth. On Star Trek: Voyager, the Greetings from Earth on the golden record are sent to Voyager by Rain Robinson in Season 3, Episode 8 "Future's End".
