 Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are closing out their Iowa caucus campaigns with notably different strategies. Both candidates are blanketing the state in the closing days of the first-in-the-nation caucus -- that's obvious. But that's where the similarities end. The secret to the Iowa caucuses is this: Not all caucus sites are created equal.  The Democratic presidential hopefuls will face voters in a CNN town hall on Monday in Des Moines -- one week before the highly anticipated Iowa caucuses. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will field questions from Iowa Democrats in this prime-time event hosted by the Iowa Democratic Party and Drake University. "We are honored to partner with CNN on their town hall with our three fantastic Democratic candidates," said Dr. Andy McGuire, chair of the Iowa Democratic Party.  Iowa isn't known as a bastion of diversity. But in the run up to the caucus on Monday, Hillary Clinton is making a concerted effort to court some of the state's racial and religious minorities. Clinton made an unexpected visit to Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church on Sunday morning, tying herself to President Barack Obama's legacy.
