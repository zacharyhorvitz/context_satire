In 2000, the U.S. promotion was halted after fraud was uncovered. A subcontracting company, Simon Marketing (a then-subsidiary of Cyrk), that had been hired by McDonald's to organize and promote the game, failed to recognize a flaw in its procedures. Chief of security Jerome P. Jacobson was able to remove the most valuable game pieces, which he then passed to associates who would redeem them and share the proceeds. According to Jacobson, his disloyalty began when executives began re-running randomized draws to ensure high-level prizes went to areas in the United States rather than Canada. "People always ask questions about where the name The Onion came from", said former President Sean Mills in an interview with Wikinews; "and, when I recently asked (co-founder) Tim Keck, who was one of the founders, he told me...literally that his uncle said he should call it The Onion when he saw him and Chris Johnson eating an onion sandwich. They had literally just cut up the onion and put it on bread."

This account was disputed by an editor of The Onion, Cole Bolton, during an event at the University of Chicago. In January 1999, when Jon Stewart became the host of The Daily Show he tapped former Onion writer/editor Karlin to be head writer of the newly restructured show. "He had heard about this group of Onion people in L.A. and, in a weird way, I was the de facto ringleader of our group in L.A. I came to New York. Jon and I connected.
