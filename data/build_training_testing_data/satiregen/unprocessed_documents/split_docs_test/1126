D’Amato’s next novelistic outing was in The Consciousness Plague, published in 2002 by Tor Books. Here D’Amato gets caught up in the possibility that our very consciousness may be engendered by microorganisms that live in the brain. Paths of exploration in this novel range from Lindisfarne  to Julian Jaynes’s Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Paul D'Amato was born to Italian American parents in 1908 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He was one of eight children. When one or both of their parents died, D'Amato opened a cigar store at the age of 15 to help support the other seven children. The store was very successful. There he met and began to work with the future heavyweight champion, "Iron" Mike Tyson, who was in a nearby reform school. He adopted Tyson after Tyson's mother died. D'Amato trained him over the next few years, encouraging the use of peek-a-boo style boxing, with the hands in front of the face for more protection. D'Amato was briefly assisted by Teddy Atlas, and later Kevin Rooney, a protégé of D'Amato, who emphasized elusive movement.
