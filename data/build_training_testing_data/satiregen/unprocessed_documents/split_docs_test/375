The stated duties of the secretary of state are to supervise the United States foreign service, immigration policy, and administer the Department of State. They must also advise the president on U.S. foreign matters such as the appointment of diplomats and ambassadors. They also advise the president of the dismissal and recall of these individuals. The secretary of state can conduct negotiations, interpret, and terminate treaties relating to foreign policy.  Almost one year to the day after the United States recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as that country's legitimate president, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo re-emphasized the US' support in his first face-to-face meeting with Guaido. The two officials met Monday on the sidelines of the Third Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism Ministerial in Bogota, Colombia. Guaido went to the Colombian capital city in defiance of a ban on his travel outside of Venezuela put in place by the government of embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. He had defied it only once before.  As impeachment drama plays out in Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will travel to Ukraine -- the country at the heart of the matter. The top US diplomat will be in Kiev next Thursday and Friday. He is the first administration official to travel there since the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Pompeo was initially scheduled to visit Ukraine, along with several other countries, earlier this month.
