 Jeb Bush said campaigning with his brother, former President George W. Bush, tomorrow could help save his presidential campaign. Bush has increasingly turned to his famous family to help save his presidential campaign. He campaigned in New Hampshire with his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush. But this will be his first campaign appearance with his brother, who left office in 2009 with poor approval ratings, but whose popularity has improved since then, particularly with conservatives.  Jeb Bush, who has struggled with the political baggage attached to his famous last name, has finally come to a place where his family is not a liability: South Carolina. This state has been good to the Bushes, handing key primary victories to both George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush in their White House bids. As Jeb Bush looks to continue his family's winning streak on Saturday in the first southern primary, his campaign is becoming an all-hands-on-deck family affair.  Donald Trump may have been the third candidate to appear on Thursday's GOP town hall on CNN, but still he loomed large over the entire event. Both John Kasich and Jeb Bush, the other two candidates involved, were asked about Trump's fight with Pope Francis, a battle which seems more like an "SNL" sketch than real life. And my Twitter feed was filled with people awaiting Trump's arrival: Would he be combative? Would he apologize to the Pope?
