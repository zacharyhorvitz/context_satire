Rebecca Guarna (fl. 1200), was an Italian physician and surgeon and author. She is one of the few woman physicians known from the Middle Ages. She studied at the University of Salerno, and was one of the women known as the "ladies of Salerno." Rebecca Guarna was a member of the same Salernitan family as the famous Romuald Guarna, priest, physician and historian. She was a student of the University of Salerno and belonged to the minority of female students of her time period. In March 2014, Rebecca joined Sunrise as Melbourne correspondent replacing Nick Etchells. In recent years, Maddern had reduced duties on Seven News as a senior reporter due to her Sunrise commitments. She remained with Sunrise until her move to the Nine Network. Nathan Templeton replaced her as Melbourne correspondent.
