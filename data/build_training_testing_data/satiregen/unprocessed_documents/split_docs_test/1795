In the early 1970s, Craig Hassell, a transplanted Long Island lacrosse fanatic, stepped up and kept the tradition alive. The 70â€™s rosters were packed with the types of free spirited players that typified the era. Predominately from Long Island and Maryland, these free spirits had little cares other than their dedication to the game. In 1976, the timing was right for yet another transplanted Long Islander to assume the responsibility for the stability of the University of Arizona Program. The tradition of the Territorial Cup goes all the way back to 1899, the year the University of Arizona first fielded a football team. In 2009, Arizona schools began competing in the Territorial Cup Series. It's a yearlong competition that includes multiple sports. The Territorial Cup trophy wasn't shared between the two rival universities, Arizona State University and University of Arizona, until 2001. After the passage of the Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862, the push for a university in Arizona grew. The Arizona Territory's "Thieving Thirteenth" Legislature approved the University of Arizona in 1885 and selected the city of Tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university. Tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but it was created as Arizona's normal school, and not a university). Flooding on the Salt River delayed Tucson's legislators, and by they time they reached Prescott, back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made.
