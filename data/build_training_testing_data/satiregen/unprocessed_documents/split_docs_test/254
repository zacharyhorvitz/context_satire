The witnesses said the heat was strong enough to make the car's metal body painful to the touch. Cash said she had to use her coat to protect her hand from being burned when she finally got back in the car. When she touched the dashboard, Landrum claimed her hand pressed into the softened vinyl, leaving an imprint that was evident weeks later. Investigators cited it as proof of the witnesses' account; however, no photograph of it exists. In 1978, Landrum took over the commentary for the revamped World Wide Wrestling (formerly Wide World Wrestling). Johnny Weaver, who provided the color commentary, later joined him. Weaver was a well-known wrestler in the JCP stable. Landrum dubbed him “The Dean of Professional Wrestling” on the opening of their show one night, and that nickname stuck for the rest of Weaver’s career. One day in April 1981, a CH-47 helicopter flew into Dayton. As Colby watched, he became very upset. Landrum decided to take him to the spot where the helicopter had landed with the hope that it would seem less frightening on the ground. When they reached the landing zone, they found a lot of people there already and had to wait some time before they were allowed to go inside the helicopter and talk to the pilot.
