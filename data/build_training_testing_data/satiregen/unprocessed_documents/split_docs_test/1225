 After a campaign season marked mainly by Democrats fleeing his shadow, President Barack Obama embarked upon the final push of what he calls his last campaign Sunday, hoping to mobilize voters in the few pockets of the country where he remains somewhat popular. Obama headlined afternoon campaign rallies for Democratic gubernatorial candidates in Connecticut and Pennsylvania, capping off a cycle that saw him rally for only one Senate candidate and a handful of governors. His diminished presence in 2014 amounted mostly to headlining high-dollar fundraisers in wealthy neighborhoods, mostly on the coasts, where he sought to motivate donors amid bleak prospects for his party in Tuesday's midterm elections. In tight races across the country, Democrats have distanced themselves from his policies, declaring themselves independent from the White House as Republicans worked overtime to lump them into the same unpopular mold.  President Barack Obama walked into the White House nearly six years ago with a robust Senate majority and a promise to change politics. Now, he's heading into his final years of office estranged from Democrats in the minority on Capitol Hill, facing Republicans uninterested in making big compromises and a public that has largely moved on from the heady early days of the administration. Obama is "anxious to get back to work" and put the midterms behind him, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, adding the president regards the final two years of his term as a "fourth quarter" with the potential for real action. He is scheduled to address the midterm results on Wednesday afternoon, just as he did in 2010 when he labeled the Republican takeover the House a "shellacking."  President Barack Obama reached out to the man who is expected to be the next Senate Majority Leader after Tuesday night's Republican  midterm wins, and left a message. Obama tried to connect with Sen. Mitch McConnell, after the Kentucky Republican won his own re-election and his party won back control of the upper chamber, in order to congratulate him and left a message, a White House official tells CNN. Aides for McConnell said the White House called early Wednesday morning and McConnell was already gone. The White House official says the administration, including Obama, are clear eyed about the results of the election.
