 The Oscars can be unpredictable, but one thing is for certain: Each year there will be at least one glaring oversight in the "In Memoriam" montage. At the 85th Academy Awards on Sunday night, Andy Griffith and Larry Hagman were among the stars left out of the show's annual tribute to the Hollywood folks who passed away in the last year. With limited time during the 3Â½-hour telecast to commemorate everyone, the academy published a gallery online honoring more than 100 late stars, some of whom weren't included in the reel on the telecast. Griffith and Hagman both appear in the 114-slide photo gallery.  One of the most surprising moments of this year's Oscars came at the very end, when first lady Michelle Obama showed up on video to help announce the best picture winner. If you're anything like us, you immediately wondered what the significance could be, especially since she was announcing the award from the White House. But when you think about it, having Obama help draw the Oscars ceremony to a close was a fitting way to end this politically saturated awards season. The real-life drama of D.C. politics can be absorbing enough on its own, but mix in Hollywood machinations and you could create a must-see movie. The 90th Academy Awards in 2018 had the lowest Nielsen ratings of all time, with less than half of the 57.25 million viewers of the 70th in 1998. In October 2018, the Academy asked Dwayne Johnson to host the 91st ceremony, believing that the popularity of Hollywood's highest-paid actor would help increase the audience. Johnson immediately began planning what he described as an "audience first" show, but could not change his schedule of filming Hobbs & Shaw and Jumanji: The Next Level.
