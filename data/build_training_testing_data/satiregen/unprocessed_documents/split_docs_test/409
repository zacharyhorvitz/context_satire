 Google: master innovator of search, advertising, and ... health care? Google has launched a mysterious new project called Calico. It's "a new company focused on health and well-being, in particular the challenge of aging and associated diseases," Google said in a short press release on Wednesday. What will Calico do, exactly? On certain occasions, the logo on Google's webpage will change to a special version, known as a "Google Doodle". This is a picture, drawing, animation or interactive game that includes the logo. It is usually done for a special event or day although not all of them are well known. Clicking on the Doodle links to a string of Google search results about the topic.  Robot cars that can take over most of the driving from their human handlers will be ready for the road within three years, according to Elon Musk, the US electric cars and space entrepreneur whose bold predictions have come to embody an ambitious new era in tech industry thinking. Tesla Motors, which startled traditional automotive giants such as General Motors and Renault-Nissan with its electric cars, is now joining the race to build cars that can drive themselves, Mr Musk, the chief executive, said. The attempt to build a driverless car would see Tesla overtake Google, which three years ago fired the starting gun in this technological race but has since struggled to find a partner to build the cars. It also marks the latest attempt by Mr Musk to gain a technological jump on the rest of the industry after his company's luxury sedan, the Model S, became the first profitable electric vehicle this year.
