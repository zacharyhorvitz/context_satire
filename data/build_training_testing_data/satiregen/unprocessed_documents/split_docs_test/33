 This Prime Day, eBay will take on its main competitor with a "crash" sale designed to poke fun at and poach customers from rival Amazon. EBay promises a special set of deals that will release only if Amazon's website goes down. (Amazon's website crashed at the beginning of Prime Day in 2018.) EBay will offer Prime Day deals no matter what, in addition to the special deals that woiuld only get offered if Amazon crashes.  Amazon Prime Day runs for two full days, Monday and Tuesday, and the online retailer is offering massive savings across a ton of departments, from tech and home to fashion and sporting goods. The markdowns are comparable to Black Friday, or maybe even better. There's no better time to stock up on household basics or splurge on that new smart home product you've been eyeing. Online shoppers around the world have already started stocking their shopping carts, so we'll keep this brief and let you get to the shopping.  Amazon has successfully invented a new shopping holiday, a kind of Black Friday in July. The e-commerce giant and its retail competitors are set to capitalize on shoppers dishing out on everything from clothes to televisions next week. Amazon Prime Day will return for the fifth time starting Monday at midnight PT, and this year the discount event will run for two full days. Amazon says it will launch new deals as often as every five minutes, encouraging Prime members to keep returning to the site.
