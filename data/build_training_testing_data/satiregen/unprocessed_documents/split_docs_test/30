On April 1963, Duk Sung Son traveled to the United States of America, where he started to teach Tae Kwon Do or “Korean Karate” as it was called then. His first classes were outdoors at Central Park in Manhattan and at the basement of downtown synagogue in New York City. At the end of 1963 he established regular classes Monday through Friday from 6 to 8pm in his first gym, located at 162 7th corner of 21st street in New York City. Health and longevity of practitioners are the major goals of Tang Soo Do practice. Consequently, serious injuries are counterproductive because they retard a level of physical training that is needed to foster emotional and intellectual growth. However, minor injuries, such as bumps, bruises and the occasional loss of wind may be invaluable experiences. Each match should begin and end with respect, compassion and a deep appreciation for the opponent. Kwon was born in Andong in what is now South Korea. His first exposure to the martial arts was at the age of seven, when he began studying taekwondo. During that period of time, following the Korean War, Korea was in a period of rebuilding its physical and cultural landscape. Formal dojangs, had not yet been constructed.
