 There are now 17 hopefuls vying for the Democratic vote to become President of the United States, but there's only one whose spouse has become a talker. If Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, is having a moment, so is his husband, 29-year-old Chasten Buttigieg. His sense of humor and revealing honesty about his feelings have been a hit on social media, boosting his followers by the tens of thousands in recent weeks and helping put "Mayor Pete" on the millennial radar. "The thing I love about him, and maybe the thing you love about him, too, is he is the same person whether we are at home folding laundry together, or if he's in front of a room like this, full of supporters.  Before South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg captured the nation's attention as a serious contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination, he was in Iowa, laying the groundwork for his forthcoming bid. Addressing a gathering of progressive activists, Buttigieg, who is gay and married to his husband, Chasten, reflected on the impact decisions made in Washington have had on his life. "Sitting down to Christmas dinner at the side of my husband, whose marriage to me, our family — not its well-being but its existence — comes by the grace of single vote on the United States Supreme Court," he said in December. After the event, a group of women mingled near the elevators and reflected on their first impression of the South Bend mayor.  Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg on Sunday again took on Vice President Mike Pence -- whose stances on LGBTQ issues have faced criticism from gay rights activists -- saying that if Pence has "a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me -- your quarrel, sir, is with my creator." Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, made the comments while speaking at the LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington. He reflected on his personal struggles with his sexuality, his decision to come out in 2015 and the fact that his being gay is not the result of a personal decision. "If me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade," Buttigieg said.
