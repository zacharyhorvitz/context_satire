 If you are way into politics, you are not the average American. Not even close. A new poll from the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center reveals how shockingly little people know about even the most basic elements of our government and the Constitution that formed it. Take your pick from this bouillabaisse of ignorance: * More than one in three people (37%) could not name a single right protected by the First Amendment.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin thinks Americans are right to be fed up with data breaches like the massive hack at Equifax. "Americans shouldn't expect these things to happen," Mnuchin said Tuesday in Manhattan. He called the breach "obviously quite unfortunate." Equifax revealed last week that as many as 143 million Americans -- roughly half the country -- may have had personal information compromised in the hack this summer, one of the worst ever. Americans are nationals and citizens of the United States of America. Although nationals and citizens make up the majority of Americans, some dual citizens, expatriates, and permanent residents may also claim American nationality. The United States is home to people of many different ethnic origins. As a result, American culture and law does not equate nationality with race or ethnicity, but with citizenship and permanent allegiance.
