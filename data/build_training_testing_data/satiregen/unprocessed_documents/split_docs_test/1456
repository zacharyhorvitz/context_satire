 Manchester City and Ivory Coast football star Yaya Toure has called on the media to be more respectful in its attitude towards religion after the Charlie Hebdo attack. Twelve people were killed by brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi at the French satirical magazine's offices last week, with the gunmen reportedly yelling, "We have avenged the Prophet" while carrying out the attack. While Toure -- a Muslim himself -- advocates freedom of speech, he feels news outlets also have responsibilities. "As a Muslim I always believe in the way people can say what they want to say," he told CNN's Amanda Davies.  Sen. Rand Paul thinks that France needs to rethink its immigration policy in light of the recent terror attacks. The Kentucky Republican said Thursday that intelligence and surveillance tactics should still be employed to prevent terrorism, but argued "there's some policy changes, though, that could be better." "I think also you got to secure your country. That means maybe that every Muslim immigrant that wishes to come to France shouldn't have an open door to come," he said on Sean Hannity's radio show, referring to Islamic radicalization in Europe.  France's Muslims warn of a growing anti-Islam backlash as the country slowly comes to terms with last week's deadly attacks on Charlie Hebdo magazine and a Jewish supermarket. Groups representing French Muslims have urged authorities to step in to protect them in the same way as they have boosted security around Jewish sites. "All Muslim organizations in France are concerned about the numerous anti-Muslim acts seen in the past few days and call on the authorities to be vigilant to ensure the security of mosques," said Dalil Boubakeur, rector of the Great Mosque of Paris and president of the French Council of the Muslim Faith. Prime Minister Manuel Valls told CNN's French affiliate BFMTV on Monday that a number of mosques had been attacked in recent days, with shots being fired in some cases.
