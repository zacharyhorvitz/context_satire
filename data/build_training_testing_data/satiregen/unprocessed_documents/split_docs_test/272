This is really one which I think was breathtaking in its surprise ... There has been, over the last few years, some specific planning for the possibility of a significant hurricane in New Orleans with a lot of rainfall, with water rising in the levees and water overflowing the levee ... And although the planning was not complete, a lot of work had been done. But there were two problems here. First of all, it's as if someone took that plan and dropped an atomic bomb simply to make it more difficult. The New Orleans Medical and Surgical Journal was a bimonthly medical journal published between 1844 and 1952, and the predecessor of the contemporary Journal of the Louisiana State Medical Society. It published Samuel Cartwright's pseudoscientific theories of race and disease, including the first treatment of the conjectural disease drapetomania. The journal was involved in debates on neuroscience and circulation in the 19th century. In 1854, physiologist Bennet Dowler assumed a position as editor of the journal after having been chairman of the Committee on Medical Science of the American Medical Association. Dowler reserved substantial portions of the journal for his own work, leading to an unpopular reputation among the journal's community. During this period, Dowler's work concerned post-mortem and statistical studies of human corpses. Dowler, who found New Orleansâ€™ population receptive of his experimentation, utilized cholera and yellow fever epidemics to supply the necessary cadavers.
