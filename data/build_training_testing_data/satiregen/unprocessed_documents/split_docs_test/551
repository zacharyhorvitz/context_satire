Zack and Cody are surprised by their aptitude test scores: Zack is told he will be a CEO, while Cody is going to turn out as a sanitation engineer. Zack soon starts acting smart, while Cody starts to have a negative attitude. Meanwhile, Maddie saves the life of a Moroccan ambassador, and later London. She becomes famous for a little while and London doesn't like it. A hawk makes a nest at the Tipton and causes havoc, so Mr. Moseby scares her away. When Cody finds that the hawk laid an egg, he cares for it while Zack films the hatching of the egg to sell on the internet. Cody continues to care for the baby hawk after the egg hatches, but when the baby hawk is ready to be released into the wild, Cody has a difficult time letting him go. Zack wants Cody to drop out of the junior spelling bee because he owes the $30 to his competitor. London and Maddie do community service. London sees that her rival got in the newspaper for doing community service, so London brings the paparazzi with her to show off herself doing community service. Sister Dominick also always comes in at the wrong time when London is faking work and Maddie and her friends were pushed out of the way by London, all the credit to London while Maddie, Corrie, and Maryâ€“Margaret are the ones doing ALL the work, and Maddie becomes infuriated as a result.
