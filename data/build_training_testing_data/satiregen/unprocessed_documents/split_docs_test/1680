The State of Florida requires students to take the Florida Standards Assessments (FSA) each year in grades 3-10. Students' results from the FSA are compiled to generate a grade for each public school under former Governor Jeb Bush's "A+ Plan." Under this plan, public schools receive a letter grade from A to F, depending on student performance and the degree to which the bottom 25% of the school has improved compared to its past performances. The higher a public school scores, the more funding it receives. The U.S. Department of Education oversees the nation's education system. The department sets uniform rules and standards which are applied nationwide. “Since the Department of Education (Education) began operations in fiscal year 1980, its mission has included promoting student achievement and ensuring equal access to educational opportunity. To do so, Education partners with state and local governments, which provide most of the resources to school districts for K-12 programs".  Hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants are lining up across the country today for the historic opportunity to apply for what's known as "deferred action." The program goes into effect today and gives nearly two million illegal immigrants, who were brought into the U.S. as children, a chance to avoid deportation for two years. They'll be able to obtain work permits and social security numbers, and even apply for financial aid for college. The program was announced by President Obama in June after Congress failed to pass the DREAM Act.
