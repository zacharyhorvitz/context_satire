Savoy was Tony's first partner at the FDA. He's a large man who fights with a pair of sai. He is also a cibopath and worked with the FDA for a very long time. He is very interested in what actually happened on the day of the bird-flu incident, and a flashback showed him holding a dying woman in his arms on that day. Applebee played on the wing in Penrith's first ever game which was a 15-12 defeat against Canterbury. Applebee was the first Penrith player to be selected for a representative side when he was picked to play for NSW City against NSW Country. Applebee spent 6 seasons at Penrith with the club finishing towards the bottom of the ladder each year and narrowly avoided the wooden spoon on each occasion. In 1973, Applebee moved to far North Queensland and played for Innisfail in the local competition. Applebee is Tony's boss at the FDA. He doesn't like Tony and tries to make his job very difficult. Once, Applebee was informed that a hit was put on Tony and only decided to inform Tony after realizing it meant more paperwork if he was killed. Applebee picked Colby to be Tony's new partner mainly because Colby pretended to blame Tony for getting injured.
