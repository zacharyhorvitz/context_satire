 A unique voting group from the 2016 election -- voters who backed independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders but were willing to vote for Donald Trump -- seems to be non-existent in the early days of the latest presidential contest. Trump's June 2015 entrance into the presidential election quickly turned that race from a debate over candidates' ideology into a question of whether voters wanted a political insider or outsider as the successor to President Barack Obama. Perhaps no group of voters signified that debate more than those who preferred Sanders (a progressive independent who was seen at the time as further left than the mainstream Democratic Party) but were willing to vote for Trump (a billionaire espousing conservative positions who took over the Republican Party with his bellicose rhetoric and take-no-prisoners political style). Those who wanted to link Trump -- with his promise to "drain the swamp" and anti-elite message -- and Sanders often called them "populists" and "anti-establishment."  The latest CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll is undoubtedly good news for former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders as the two lead the large pack of possible contenders for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020. But the poll also reveals strengths and weaknesses for those two and several other Democratic contenders. Biden For Biden, it's mostly a positive picture. The new poll shows him with 81% favorability among likely Democratic caucusgoers.  The latest CNN/Des Moines Register/MediaCom 2020 Iowa poll shows former Vice President Joe Biden continuing to lead the pack with 27% and Sen. Bernie Sanders close behind with 25%. Sanders is up from our last poll, though the relative order remains the same. No other candidate reaches double-digits. But beyond these topline numbers, the poll reveals some interesting trends in the electorate.
