We believe those spirits still exist and are concentrated in our opera house – that's where they gather and most of the energy is felt." He later said in 2017, "There's a little girl by the school house, several apparitions at the opera house. As mentioned, additional sequences and songs from the original off-Broadway show were dropped or re-written in order for the feature version to be paced well.
