President James Bryant Conant reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among research institutions. He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty to make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as at the college level. The resulting Report, published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in 20th century American education.  The very public discussion between sleep guru Arianna Huffington and Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the merits of rest is about much more than getting enough Zs. It speaks to the broader struggle in Silicon Valley -- and beyond -- of achieving a healthy life-work balance. To recap their conversation, Musk, in an emotional interview with the New York Times last week, called the past 12 months "the most difficult and painful year" of his career. He admitted that he has great difficulty refueling and recharging, doesn't spend enough time with his family, and takes Ambien to help him sleep. The colleges of England's Oxford and Cambridge Universities are communities within the larger university, each an association of scholars sharing room and board. Harvard's founders may have envisioned it as the first in a series of sibling colleges on the English model which would eventually constitute a universityâ€”though no further colleges materialized in colonial times. The Indian College was active from 1640 to no later than 1693, but it was a minor addition not operated in federation with Harvard according to the English model. Harvard began granting higher degrees in the late eighteenth century, and it was increasingly styled Harvard University, even as Harvard College was increasingly thought of as the university's undergraduate division in particular.
