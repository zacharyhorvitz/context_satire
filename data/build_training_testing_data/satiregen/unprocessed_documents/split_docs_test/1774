 Chief Justice John Roberts swore in senators last week to officially begin the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, but the trial starts in earnest Tuesday afternoon, when Republicans and Democrats are expected to battle over a resolution setting the rules for the trial and start opening arguments shortly afterward. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will propose a timeline for the trial that would break from the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, according to a four-page organizing resolution obtained by CNN. It's possible senators will vote to go into closed session in order to debate the issues that divide them because impeachment rules prevent them from speaking publicly during the trial. Here's what we know: When will the trial get started?  The third Senate impeachment trial of a US president in history convened on Thursday with the reading of the impeachment articles against President Donald Trump and the swearing in of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and the senators who will decide whether Trump should be removed from office. The Senate conducted its ceremonial functions of the impeachment trial on Thursday before the actual arguments will get underway next Tuesday. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and the lead impeachment manager, read the articles aloud in the chamber while senators looked on from their desks. LIVE UPDATES: The latest on President Trump's impeachment Roberts was sworn in shortly several hours later.  The House on Wednesday formally presented two articles of impeachment to the Senate after voting to approve the seven managers to prosecute the case against President Donald Trump, a long-awaited move that marks the beginning of the third Senate impeachment trial of a US President in history. The House managers walked the articles across the Capitol just after 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The articles were received by the Senate, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the House managers would formally present the articles at noon ET Thursday.
