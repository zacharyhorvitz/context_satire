 Disney is buying a huge chunk of 21st Century Fox in a deal that promises to reshape the media industry and help the entertainment giant fend off digital rivals such as Netflix. The $52.4 billion deal will combine two of the biggest players in Hollywood. The sale represents a remarkable turn in the career of octogenarian mogul Rupert Murdoch, who is cashing out after building a major media empire. For its part, Disney is adding even more prime entertainment assets to an already swollen portfolio as it battles upstart streaming services that have undercut the traditional cable subscription model.  Bob Iger could wind up being the CEO of the 21st century after sealing a deal to scoop up a big chunk of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox for more than $50 billion. Much like billionaire industrialist Tony Stark -- aka Iron Man in the Disney-owned Marvel franchise -- Iger has now built a massive movie and TV empire that is rivaled by nobody else in Hollywood. Under Iger's watch, Disney has scooped up "Toy Story" and "Finding Nemo" animated studio Pixar, Marvel Entertainment and its stable of superheroes from "The Avengers," and Star Wars owner Lucasfilm. The purchase of the Fox film studio, along with some regional sports networks, cable channels FX and National Geographic and Fox's stake in streaming video network Hulu, is yet another move by Iger to make Disney a content company that literally has entertainment brands that can hook boys and girls from cradle to grave.  Disney has just bought itself a very messy deal in Europe. The U.S. entertainment giant announced Thursday that it will spend $52.4 billion to swallow most of 21st Century Fox, including its minority stake in British pay TV provider Sky. Here's where things get interesting: Long before it was for sale, Fox struck a $15 billion deal to buy the 61% of Sky it didn't already own. The takeover -- inked a year ago -- has repeatedly been delayed due to a U.K. government review and its future is in doubt.
