Ronald Dee White (born December 18, 1956) is an American stand-up comedian, actor and author, best known as a charter member of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. Nicknamed "Tater Salad", he is the author of the book I Had the Right to Remain Silent But I Didn't Have the Ability, which appeared on the New York Times best seller list. Fellow Blue Collar Comedy Tour costar Ron White declined to star on Blue Collar TV due to a fear of being typecast as "blue collar". However, he guest-starred on many episodes of the show. On his 2006 comedy album, You Can't Fix Stupid, White jokingly cited his own lack of work ethic as a reason for not participating more on the show. As of 2011, Foxworthy, Engvall and Larry still do comedy tours together under the title Them Idiots Whirled Tour.This is keeping true to their claim that One for the Road was the last Blue Collar tour, thus respecting the fact that Ron White is not part of it. A CD and DVD of the new show from the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was released on March 13, 2012.
