 Bank of America wants to talk to gun makers about assault weapons. After an AR-15-style rifle was used to murder 17 people at a Florida high school last week, the company said in a statement Saturday that it will "examine what we can do to help end the tragedy of mass shootings." "n immediate step we're taking is to engage the limited number of clients we have that manufacture assault weapons for non-military use to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility," the statement reads. Bank of America did not detail any concrete actions it plans to take, but the announcement is the latest sign that businesses are increasingly willing to put pressure on the gun industry.  Delta's decision to cut ties with the NRA could cost it a generous tax break from the state of Georgia. The state's Republicans — including a major candidate for governor— are threatening to kill part of a bill that would eliminate a state tax on jet fuel. If it passes, the provision is expected to save the Atlanta-based airline tens of millions of dollars. "We felt that it was wrong for them to single out one company," said Chuck Hufstetler, chairman of the state's Senate Finance Committee.  For a long time, companies avoided political controversies. Now, their customers are pushing them to pick a side. Activists are demanding that businesses weigh in on immigration, climate change and, most recently, gun control. The problem is, it's hard to take a stand without getting burned.
