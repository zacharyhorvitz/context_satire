Stephen Glass saw the film and, when reflecting about the experience, he said, "It was very painful for me. It was like being on a guided tour of the moments of my life I am most ashamed of". During Hausner's half-hour ramble to the jury right before sentencing, he apologized to several people including his family. He stated that he ruined the family name, as people would hear the Hausner name and think of Charles Manson. He even compared himself to Charles Manson. "When you think of Manson, 50 years from now you'll think of Hausner", he said. According to reports, police first identified Dale Hausner and Samuel Dieteman as suspects on July 31, 2006, through tips received from the community. The most important tips came from Ron Horton, who died before he could testify at trial. Horton was a friend of Dieteman, and alleged that Dieteman confessed to involvement in the shootings when he was drunk at the Star Dust Inn, his regular haunt. Horton was initially uncertain if Dieteman's confession was serious, but nonetheless went to police after the shooting death of Robin Blasnek (22) of Mesa, Arizona, which he found upsetting and said "affected me quite a bit".
