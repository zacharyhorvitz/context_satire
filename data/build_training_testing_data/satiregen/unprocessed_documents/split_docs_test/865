Robert Hooke was born in 1635 in Freshwater on the Isle of Wight to John Hooke and Cecily Gyles. Robert was the last of four children, two boys and two girls, and there was an age difference of seven years between him and the next youngest. Their father John was a Church of England priest, the curate of Freshwater's Church of All Saints, and his two brothers (Robert's uncles) were also ministers. Robert Hooke was expected to succeed in his education and join the Church. Simon, Patricia and Doyle Cosentino make their way back to an apartment in Los Angeles to think up the next stage of their plan now that Valecross is out of the picture, and while there, it is revealed that Simon originally met Patricia in Iraq when escaping from the Russian heist. They head to the Valecross home in order to search for the "nomad" that Valecross mentioned just before he died. When they get there, Mrs Valecross immediately recognizes Templar and they decide to call Rayt Marius, who, it is revealed, has a history with Patricia. Burns's worldly prospects were perhaps better than they had ever been; but he had become soured, and had alienated many of his friends by freely expressing sympathy with the French and American Revolutions and the advocates of reform and votes for all men. His political views came to the notice of his employers and in an attempt to prove his loyalty to the Crown, Burns joined the Royal Dumfries Volunteers in March 1795. As his health began to give way, he began to age prematurely and fell into fits of despondency. The habits of intemperance (alleged mainly by temperance activist James Currie) are said to have aggravated his long-standing possible rheumatic heart condition.
