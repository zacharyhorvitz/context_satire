 "When you're attacking FBI agents because you're under criminal investigation, you're losing,"  Sarah Sanders, then a Donald Trump campaign aide, famously said of Hillary Clinton supporters before the 2016 presidential election. Although she has repeatedly struggled with the facts -- and now serves as White House press secretary -- Sanders' apt tweet remains wisdom for the ages. Both President Donald Trump and Sanders have led the charge against special counsel Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutors investigating the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia and other crimes unearthed in that endeavor. Trump has repeatedly called the investigation a "witch hunt" in an attempt to paint Mueller and his team as a band of corrupt authorities trying to bring down an innocent President. In an August 2019 interview with The Washington Post, Donald Trump opened up about his relationship with his late brother and expressed regret over how he treated Fred Jr. and his struggle with alcoholism. Trump said Freddy's memory still shapes his life to this day, and had a huge impact on the trajectory of his own business career and life. In the interview Donald Trump said, "He was so handsome, and I saw what alcohol did to him even physicallyÂ ... and that had an impact on me, too."  Michael Cohen -- a "very weak person" in the words of President Donald Trump -- made a plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller on Thursday that should not be ignored. It's another significant moment in a probe that appears to be picking up speed and tightening the vise around some senior members of the Trump administration. Consider what Cohen pleaded guilty to doing: Lying to Congress about the nature and extent of his dealing with Russians over a proposed Trump Tower development in Moscow. Cohen told Congress all conversations with the Russians ceased in January 2016, right around the time when Trump first faced voters in the Iowa caucuses.
