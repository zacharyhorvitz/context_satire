 Americans are making a big mistake with their investment decisions. Even when it comes to money they won't need for more than a decade, 26% of Americans prefer cash for their long-term investments, edging out stocks, bonds, gold and real estate, according to a new Bankrate survey of more than 1,000 U.S. adults. "What people are perceiving as a safe investment strategy is actually quite risky for a time horizon of 10 years or more," said Greg McBride, Bankrate's senior financial analyst.

"You can't tell me I have prostate cancer and that we're just going to 'watch it.'" Brawley is the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, a world-renowned cancer expert and practicing oncologist.
