In an article in the Los Angeles Times, reporter Valerie Reitman credited Helen Burns, who had been part of the 2002 drive to designate the restaurant as a state historic landmark, with noticing the demolition around 5 p.m. on January 7. The original kitchen and the back of the coffee shop had been demolished by the time Burns arrived. She phoned the police and then began phoning other preservationists and car buffs, urging them to notify the police as well. Harvey's was featured in the nationally distributed magazine Sports Illustrated. In its 1961 issue, the author wrote "A favorite in the Los Angeles area is Harvey's Broiler, a drive-in in the suburb of Downey. Here high school hot rodders gather to partake of the glorified "chubby," a double hamburger, gape at one another's cars and check on the latest fads. On weekend nights hundreds of cars jam the parking lot, and eager drivers waiting for a berth circle the block. Spillman's black pickup truck matched the description of a vehicle seen in a parking lot near the victims' home on the night of the murder. That evening Spillman was stopped by an East Wenatchee police officer in the parking lot of a VFW hall nearby. Later a knife was recovered at that location. It was a 12-inch knife covered in blood and appeared to match a knife set in the victims' home.
