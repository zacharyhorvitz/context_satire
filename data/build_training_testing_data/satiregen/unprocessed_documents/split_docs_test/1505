 A decision by President Donald Trump to use force in retaliation for an alleged chemical weapons attack in Syria appears inevitable and imminent. But his goals in taking such action are less clear, as is the scale of the US response. Trump effectively boxed himself into acting since he placed his and America's credibility on the line by blasting a Syrian government airfield with cruise missiles following a similar outrage against civilians last year. The President vowed Monday to respond to a suspected chemical gas attack in Syria, saying the US response would be forceful.  Top military officials, including Defense Secretary James Mattis, warned President Donald Trump during an afternoon meeting Thursday that he risks escalating US involvement in Syria if he goes forward with the type of aggressive bombing campaign he has pressed for over the past week, according to US and western officials briefed on the conversation. Trump has pushed military leaders to develop plans for a sustained assault on Syrian regime targets in response to last weekend's chemical attack, the officials said. But Mattis and other members of the President's national security team cautioned Trump during the meeting that such a strategy could pull the US into direct conflict with Russia and Iran. The resistance has upset Trump, who wanted to take quick action and feels like the options being presented to him don't go far enough, according to the officials.  The US-led military strikes in Syria raise a number of questions: First, and most basic, what exactly is US policy in Syria? President Donald Trump said just two weeks ago in a speech in Ohio that the US would "be coming out of Syria like very soon." Now, Trump has presided over a large-scale bombing operation aimed at three chemical weapons production and storage targets in Syria, including in Damascus, the Syrian capital. So what is the Trump administration policy?
