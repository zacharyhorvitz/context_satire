 For months, Facebook and Twitter investors shrugged off concerns about election meddling, regulatory scrutiny and an industry-wide privacy awakening. All that mattered was the two platforms kept getting more people to scroll past ads, thereby making more money. Facebook's stock soared to all-time highs despite the onslaught of bad press that followed the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. And Twitter nearly doubled in value this year on enthusiasm for its business turnaround.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to clarify his controversial comments about  Holocaust deniers Wednesday afternoon, hours after he was quoted saying some deniers who post on Facebook aren't "intentionally getting it wrong." Zuckerberg made his comments during an interview that ReCode's Kara Swisher published Wednesday morning. He cited Holocaust denials as an example of controversial misinformation that Facebook would allow to remain on the platform. Facebook has said that it allows conspiracy theories to remain on the site, but limits their reach so fewer people see them. Facebook has been criticized for not doing enough to limit the spread of fake news stories on their site, especially after the 2016 United States presidential election, which some have claimed Donald Trump would not have won if Facebook had not helped spread what they claim to have been fake stories that were biased in his favor. Mark Zuckerberg has begun to take steps to eliminate the prevalence of fake news on Facebook as a result criticisms of Facebook's influence on the presidential election. At a conference called Techonomy Mark Zuckerberg stated in regards to Donald Trump, "There's a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way that they did is because they saw some fake news". Zuckerberg affirms the idea that people do not stray from their own ideals and political leanings.
