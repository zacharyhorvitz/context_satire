Throughout the season, the Red Sox players and organization formed a close association with the city of Boston and its people in relation to the Boston Marathon bombings that occurred on April 15, 2013. On April 20, the day after the alleged bombers were captured, David Ortiz gave a pre-game speech following a ceremony honoring the victims and the local law enforcement, in which he stated, "This is our fucking city! And nobody is going to dictate our freedom! Stay strong!" The Red Sox swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series. The Red Sox never trailed throughout the series; Mark Bellhorn hit a game-winning home run off Pesky's Pole in game 1, and Schilling pitched another bloodied-sock victory in game 2, followed by similarly masterful pitching performances by Martinez and Derek Lowe. It was the Red Sox' first championship in 86 years. Manny Ram√≠rez was named World Series MVP.  A front-row seat to potentially witness history Wednesday night at Fenway Park in Boston won't come cheap -- and neither will the tickets for standing-room-only. The last time the Boston Red Sox won a World Series at home, the team featured a 23-year-old ace pitcher named Babe Ruth, who won two games en route to a 4-2 series victory over the Chicago Cubs. That was 1918, the year in New England lore when the Sox supposedly fell under a curse that kept them from ever again winning the World Series. Though the Curse of the Bambino was finally vanquished with Boston's World Series title in 2004 -- and then for good measure in 2007 -- those victories came on the road, not at their Fenway Park home.
