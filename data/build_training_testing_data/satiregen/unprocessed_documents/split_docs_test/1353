 The creator of the Labradoodle cross-breed has said he inadvertently unleashed a "Frankenstein('s) monster". Wally Conron, 90, who worked for Guide Dogs Victoria in Australia when he bred the first Labrador-Poodle cross in 1989, spoke of his regrets at having begun a trend for designer breeds on an ABC podcast. "I opened a Pandora's box and released a Frankenstein('s) monster," he said. His "big regret" is that his invention paved the way for "unethical, ruthless people" to breed the dogs without thinking of the health of their offspring.  When Anthony Rogers's beloved dog Bobo went missing, he was despondent. The two are homeless, he told CNN, but they've found family in each other and their midtown Memphis community. So when they reunited, naturally, it was nothing short of enchanting. In a video from Memphis Animal Services, Bobo bounds into Rogers' arms, his tail wagging furiously.
