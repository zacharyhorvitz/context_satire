World AIDS Day, designated on 1 December every year since 1988, is an international day dedicated to raising awareness of the AIDS pandemic caused by the spread of HIV infection and mourning those who have died of the disease. Government and health officials, non-governmental organizations, and individuals around the world observe the day, often with education on AIDS prevention and control. Additionally, AIDS service organizations provide resources beyond medical services. The lack of knowledge about AIDS and the resulting panic and misinformation was the motivating force behind many community service organizations who worked to provide education and dispel myths about the disease. This continues to be an enormous issue today and is one of the most important services AIDS organizations provides. They also can provide community health and wellness education, personal and family counseling, healthy sexuality and sexually transmitted infection prevention awareness, safe sex materials, and legal advice and services. Spreading awareness about AIDS also began to take place in other locations. Across Canada AIDS Awareness Week is the last week in November. In 2002, the Canadian Public Health Association (CPHA) led a bilingual campaign for their awareness week from November 24-December 1, 2002. This campaign was centered on ending the stigma and discrimination against people who have HIV/AIDS.
