This act was part of a bigger movement in the early 20th century to use special groups like commissions to regulate and oversee certain forms of business. The Federal Trade Commission Act works in junction with The Sherman Act and The Clayton Act. Any violations of The Sherman Act will also violate the Federal Trade Commission Act so the Federal Trade Commission can act on cases that violate each act. The Federal Trade Commission Act, along with two other antitrust laws, were created for the sole objective to "protect the process of competition for the benefit of consumers, making sure there are strong incentives for businesses to operate efficiently, keep prices down, and keep quality up." In 1982 the Reagan administration used the Sherman Act to break up AT&T into one long-distance company and seven regional "Baby Bells", arguing that competition should replace monopoly for the benefit of consumers and the economy as a whole. The pace of business takeovers quickened in the 1990s, but whenever one large corporation sought to acquire another, it first had to obtain the approval of either the FTC, FCC or the Justice Department. Often the government demanded that certain subsidiaries be sold so that the new company would not monopolize a particular geographical market. The inspiration and motivation for this act started in 1890, when the Sherman Act was passed. This era in time was an antitrust movement to prevent manufacturers from joining price-fixing cartels. After the case Northern Securities Co. v. United States, which dismantled a J. P. Morgan company, antitrust enforcement became institutionalized. Soon after, Roosevelt created the Bureau of Corporations, an agency that reported on the economy and businesses in the industry.
