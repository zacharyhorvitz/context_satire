When we made cars for the car shows, we worked at night and we were all tired, so we would joke around to keep our morale up. There was a profiler working with us who made the locks. He was two meters tall with two enormous hands, and he performed all the little jobs. He spoke almost only Piedmontese, didn’t even speak Italian. Lamborghini's increasing wealth allowed him to purchase faster more expensive cars than the tiny Fiats he had tinkered with during his youth. He owned cars such as Alfa Romeos and Lancias during the early 1950s and at one point he had enough cars to use a different one every day of the week, adding a Mercedes-Benz 300SL, a Jaguar E-Type coupé, and two Maserati 3500 GTs. Of the latter, Lamborghini said, "Adolfo Orsi, then the owner of Maserati, was a man I had a lot of respect for: he had started life as a poor boy, like myself. But I did not like his cars much.  There aren't too many tracks where Mark Webber can claim bragging rights over Sebastian Vettel but Interlagos is one of them. The Australian, who bows out of Formula One at Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix, is a double winner (2009 and 2011) at the famous old Sao Paulo track while his Red Bull teammate can only claim a solitary triumph back in 2010. Many eyes will be on the German world champion as he looks to equal Alberto Ascari's 60-year record of nine consecutive race wins, but there will be others who will be quietly willing the Australian to a third victory at Interlagos in his 215th and final race. "I think on Sunday it'll be a little bit different but it still feels like a normal race at the moment," Webber said Thursday.
