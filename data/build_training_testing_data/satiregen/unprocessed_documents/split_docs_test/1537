Swanson became a vegetarian around 1928 and was an early health food advocate who was known for bringing her own meals to public functions in a paper bag. Swanson told actor Dirk Benedict about macrobiotic diets when he was battling prostate cancer at a very early age. He had refused conventional therapies and credited this kind of diet and healthy eating with his recovery. In 1975, Swanson traveled the United States and helped to promote the book Sugar Blues written by her husband, William Dufty. Swanson was angered by the response, as she felt those very studios had produced questionable films themselves, and were jealous at not having the chance to produce Rain. After another threatening telegram, she decided to first appeal to the MPAA, and then the newspapers. She heard back only from Marcus Loew, who promised to appeal on her behalf, and since he owned a chain of theaters this eased some of her concerns. Figuring the silence meant the matter had been dropped, Swanson began filming on Sadie Thompson which already had $250,000 invested in it. William Swanson (1819 – 23 April 1903) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament in  Auckland, New Zealand. He represented the Newton electorate from 1871 to 1884, when he retired. He was a minister in the Vogel Ministry, 1876 and Grey Ministry 1877–1879 as a Member of the Executive Council. He was then appointed to the Legislative Council in 1885, a position he held until his death.In the 1870s he won a bet with John Sangster Macfarlane who had claimed that a certain politician would soon be in Mt Eden (gaol), and used to display the cheque for £80 which he received from Macfarlane but did not cash.
