In mid-September, a video surfaced of Romney speaking before a group of supporters in which he stated that 47 percent of the nation pays no income tax, are dependent on the federal government, see themselves as victims, and will support President Obama unconditionally. Romney went on to say: "And so my job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." After facing criticism about the tone and accuracy of these comments, he at first characterized them as "inelegantly stated", then a couple of weeks later commented: "I said something that's just completely wrong."  Mitt Romney's efforts to turn round his presidential campaign were thrown off course after video clips emerged in which he said US President Barack Obama could count on the support of 47 per cent of Americans who are "dependent on government", do not pay tax and "believe that they are victims". The clips were posted on the website of Mother Jones, a liberal magazine, and were widely circulated via Twitter, creating more distractions for the Romney campaign at a time when many Republicans fear that it is veering off track. In one clip, Romney says: "There are 47 per cent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what . .  The controversy over the comments that Mitt Romney made about Obama supporters during a private fundraiser in May continues to unfold this morning after secretly recorded videos of the meeting were leaked last night. Regarding the millions of Americans who rely on government support, Romney comments, "My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." Romney campaign senior adviser Bay Buchanan responds to the backlash over the comments on Starting Point this morning.
