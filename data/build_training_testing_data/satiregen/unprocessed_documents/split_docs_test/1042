The hospital was dedicated on January 8, 1928 in front of 5,000 people who crowded shoulder to shoulder on "hospital hill". Thieresia M. Norberg was hired as the hospital's first administrator a few months before the dedication with the salary of $50 per week plus "maintenance". The first patient, Guy Lowes from Cape Girardeau County, was admitted to the hospital on January 9, 1928 for a tonsillectomy. The first baby was born in the new hospital on January 17, 1928 to Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Hahs of Cape Girardeau. The merged system includes five hospitals, more than 550 physicians and 80 outpatient clinics in Illinois and Wisconsin. Rockford Health System has a 396-bed hospital and a 61-bed rehab center. Mercy has hospitals in Janesville and Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and a 15-bed facility in Harvard, Illinois. Mr. Bea said this partnership adds specialty pediatric and neonatal care that Mercy does not offer. The hospital has built a $33 million cancer center on the west campus of the hospital, next to Interstate 55. The new Regional Cancer Center was scheduled to open in December 2010.
