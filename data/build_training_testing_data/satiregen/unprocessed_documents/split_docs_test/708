Back at school, Olivia sees hallucinations calling on her to pick truth or dare. After being harassed by the aggressive hallucinations she picks "truth" and blurts out that that Markie has been serially unfaithful to Lucas. The other friends disbelieve her explanation of a cursed game until they learn that Ronnie was forced to kill himself after failing to complete a dare. Lucas gets messages from the game until he picks "truth" and admits that he has always had feelings for Olivia. Friedrich Nietzsche believed the search for truth, or 'the will to truth', was a consequence of the will to power of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the will to power, and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in Beyond Good and Evil, "The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding..." (aphorism 4).  Sid Caesar was a man of many words. The comic, writer and star of "Your Show of Shows" who died Wednesday knew his way around a punch line. Here are just a few of his pithy quotes and clips of some of his performances: "Comedy has to be based on truth. You take the truth and you put a little curlicue at the end."
