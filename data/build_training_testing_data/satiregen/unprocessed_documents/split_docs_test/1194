 Exes Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin have managed to segue their past love into more of a sibling type situation. The actress and "Goop" founder appeared on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" Thursday and talked about her relationship with the Coldplay frontman. The pair famously decided to "consciously uncouple" in 2014 after 11 years of marriage and two children, but Paltrow said they are still close. "He's really like my brother," Paltrow told Colbert. The Pink Ralph Lauren dress of Gwyneth Paltrow refers to the pink dress, designed by Ralph Lauren, which Gwyneth Paltrow wore to the 71st Academy Awards on 21 March 1999 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. The dress is cited by several sources as one of the greatest dresses in the history of the red carpet of the Oscars, and the style was compared to that of the actress Grace Kelly. The dress was widely copied after the event, and Paltrow was credited for bringing pink back into fashion. 6IX. In 2019, Pitt parodied the iconic ending of the movie Se7en for Mother’s Brewing Company and a beer named after his likeness called Doin’ Good. Pitt does a wholesome interpretation of his brother Brad's role as Detective David Mills and delivers the movie's most famous line, “What’s in the booooooox?”  The commercial was a promotion of Doin’ Good Orange Wheat Ale, with a portion of the proceeds going to Pitt's charity, Care To Learn. The video, titled 6ix, is a play on the six pack that rests in the famous box.
