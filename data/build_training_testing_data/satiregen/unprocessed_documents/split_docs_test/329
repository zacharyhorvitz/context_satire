 Joi Ito, the director of the Media Lab at MIT, resigned Saturday and the university is calling for an independent investigation following explosive allegations that he and at least one other person at the lab made efforts to make sure Jeffrey Epstein's name was not associated with donations he made or helped solicit. Internal communications and documents obtained by CNN -- first reported by the New Yorker --  show Epstein was integral to incoming donations from major donors, including $2 million from Bill Gates and at least $5 million from Leon Black, the founder of private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Ito submitted his resignation Saturday as lab director and as a professor, according to a statement from MIT President L. Rafael Reif. His statement referenced the New Yorker piece, saying "because the accusations in the story are extremely serious, they demand an immediate, thorough and independent investigation." The MIT Media Lab is a research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, growing out of MIT's Architecture Machine Group in the School of Architecture. Its research does not restrict to fixed academic disciplines, but draws from technology, media, science, art, and design. As of 2014, Media Lab's research groups include neurobiology, biologically inspired fabrication, socially engaging robots, emotive computing, bionics, and hyperinstruments.The Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and former MIT President Jerome Wiesner, and is housed in the Wiesner Building (designed by I. M. Pei), also known as Building E15. The Lab has been written about in the popular press since 1988, when Stewart Brand published The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at M.I.T., and its work was a regular feature of technology journals in the 1990s.  Signe Swenson, a former development associate and alumni coordinator at the MIT media lab, told CNN on Saturday that she repeatedly expressed concern about MIT's ties to Jeffrey Epstein, but the lab's leadership made it clear that his donations were to be kept secret. Swenson -- who first spoke to the New Yorker - says she first learned of Epstein's ties to MIT when she had a business breakfast with Peter Cohen, the lab's Director of Development and Strategy at the time, in early 2014. Swenson said Cohen told her that the media lab's director, Joi Ito, had a relationship with Epstein, that Epstein would be donating money to the lab, and that part of her job would involve assisting with those donations. Swenson said she told Cohen at the time that she knew Epstein was a "disqualified prospect" as a donor to MIT because of his state prostitution charges in Florida, but that Cohen did not seem to be surprised by the information .
