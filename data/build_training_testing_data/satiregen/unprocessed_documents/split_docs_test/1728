 Tom Steyer's strategy did not appear to pay off. The billionaire hedge-fund founder plowed millions of dollars into television and social media ads to promote his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, but he failed to register a minimum of 2 percentage points in two polls released Wednesday morning. Without those polls, he is likely to miss the debate stage in Houston next month. Steyer entered the race late -- on July 9 -- and scrambled to meet the Democratic National Committee's polling and donor benchmarks.  With the deadline fast approaching to qualify for the September debate stage, a handful of Democratic presidential candidates is on a spending spree to find donors and supporters who can help them meet the debate requirements. The stakes are high for lower-tier candidates, hoping to improve their political fortunes with a breakout moment in a nationally televised debate. But they face barriers to entry: They must attract 130,000 unique donors and register at least 2% support in four polls endorsed by the Democratic National Committee. California billionaire Tom Steyer, who recently announced he had met the 130,000-donor threshold, still had not met the polling requirement for the September debate as of Thursday morning.  More than $15 million. That's what Tom Steyer has spent on television and digital advertising in less than two months as he has raced to make a name for himself as a Democratic presidential contender. But on Thursday, the results were clear. Despite filling the television airwaves and the Facebook feeds of voters in early voting states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the billionaire hedge-fund founder had not cleared the last remaining obstacle to join next month's nationally televised debates: earning at least 2% support in four polls sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee.
