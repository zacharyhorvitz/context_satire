The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a unit of the United States Department of Labor. It is the principal fact-finding agency for the U.S. government in the broad field of  labor economics and statistics and serves as a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System. The BLS is a governmental statistical agency that collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates essential statistical data to the American public, the U.S. Congress, other Federal agencies, State and local governments, business, and labor representatives. The BLS also serves as a statistical resource to the United States Department of Labor, and conducts research into how much families need to earn to be able to enjoy a decent standard of living.  Jerome Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, makes his first appearance on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Every Fed chair goes before Congress twice a year to report on the state of the economy. Investors will be paying even closer attention this time for clues on how quickly the Fed might raise interest rates if inflation picks up. Lawmakers will get their first glimpse of Powell's plans for the Fed when his prepared testimony is released at 8:30 a.m.  Black unemployment is near an all-time low, but that only tells part of the story. One in every five working-age black men in the United States did not work at all in 2016, nor earn any income. "It's staggering that this level of black men are disconnected from the workforce," says Janelle Jones, an analyst at the Economic Policy Institute who co-authored a recently published, wide-ranging report on hours worked by all workers ages 25 to 54.
