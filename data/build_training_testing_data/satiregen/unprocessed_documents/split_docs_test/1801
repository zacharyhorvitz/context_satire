In the first year of the program, Florida State competed as an independent program without conference affiliation. They were members of the Dixie Conference for three years before returning to independence. They would remain this way until 1992 when, after being courted by several conferences including the Southeastern Conference, they opted to join the Atlantic Coast Conference which is the same conference that they compete in today. A 2019 article in Bleacher Report revealed that the decline of the Seminole program began after the 2013 national championship season; several assistants claimed that the players seemed to lose their drive at this point. The Bleacher Report article also revealed that Fisher had taken a laissez-faire attitude toward academics, giving his assistants a mandate to "keep players eligible" above all else. By the time Fisher left, Florida State had the worst Academic Progress Rate score of any Power Five program, and was actually on the verge of an automatic postseason ban. Florida State maintains two traditional rivals in all sports with the Florida Gators and the Miami Hurricanes. Florida State University is the only school in the State of Florida to play both Florida and Miami year in and year out in all sports. Most notably is the football rivalry with the Gators who hold a 35–26–2 all-time lead against the Seminoles. The series began with Florida dominating for the first few years, but it has since become more balanced.
