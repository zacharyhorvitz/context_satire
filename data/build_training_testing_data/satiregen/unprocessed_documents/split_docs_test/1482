Years later, Bill Clinton expressed his continued anger about the Foster rumors and theories, clenching a fist as he spoke: "I heard a lot of the right-wing talk show people ... and all the sleazy stuff they said. They didn't give a rip that he had killed himself or that his family was miserable or that they could break the hearts . It was just another weapon to slug us with, to dehumanize us with." Detective Jason Foster goes undercover to take down a crime ring that has been impenetrable by the police department for years. However, Foster finds himself drawn in by the unique persona of ringleader Stephen "Deuces" Brooks and the dual life that he leads. The mission is further complicated when Foster's sister Janet also falls under Deuce's spell. Margulies sent the completed script to James Ponsoldt, his former student at Yale University and a Sundance Award–winning director. The New York Times has described him as "A devoted David Foster Wallace fan himself." Ponsoldt had excerpts read at his wedding from Wallace’s memorable commencement speech "This is Water", at Kenyon College. (Ponsoldt told The Wall Street Journal he had read Wallace since high school, and that Infinite Jest "was the most substantive relationship of my freshman year.")
