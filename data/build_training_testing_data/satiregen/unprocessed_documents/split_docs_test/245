Later investigation revealed that detectives doubted Smith's story from the start and believed that she murdered her sons. By the second day of the investigation, the police suspected that she knew their location and hoped that they were still alive. Investigators started to search the nearby lakes and ponds, including John D. Long Lake, where their bodies eventually were found. Initial water searches did not locate the car because the police believed it would be within 30 feet of the shore, and did not search farther; it turned out to be 122 feet from the shore. Smith was a member of Greeley Estates from January 2008 to November 2008. He left the band on November 14, 2008, the day before the band was about to go on tour with Alesana. The band said "not to fret" and that the position would be filled. During this brief association, Smith was featured on some tracks from the album Go West Young Man, Let the Evil Go East. On October 25, 1994, Smith reported to police that her vehicle had been carjacked by a black man who drove away with her sons still inside. The composite sketch of the alleged carjacker, however was "too generic" in the sense that it described half of the African-American men who lived in the community. For nine days, she made dramatic pleas on national television for their rescue and return. However, following an intensive investigation and a nationwide search, she confessed on November 3, 1994 to letting her car roll into nearby John D. Long Lake, drowning them inside.
