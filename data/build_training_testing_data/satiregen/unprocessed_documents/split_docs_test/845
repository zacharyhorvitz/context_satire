 It isn't just that all the staffers in the Obama administration moved out of the White House overnight. Offices were cleared, desk were emptied. And yes, even photos came off walls. Photos of President Barack Obama and his family that had lined the walls of the West Wing corridors were taken down.  After a brutal first several days for the Trump administration, one has to ask: Where was the White House chief of staff? Traditionally, the chief of staff performs a number of valuable roles for a president, from advising him on policy and politics, to representing him to the media and Congress, to making sure the administrative and policy processes run efficiently. It's still very early, and things obviously could change, but so far, during this difficult first week for the Trump White House, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has been largely AWOL. In some ways, this should not be a big surprise.  The walls, just days earlier bedecked with portraits of President Obama at work, were covered with empty frames, awaiting a new leading man. The hallways that had been buzzing with energy were strangely still, as all but the most senior staff had already turned in their badges and moved on. In the mostly emptied West Wing, those who remained packed up a few last items between hugs, handshakes, laughs and memories. The White House on Thursday was winding down, the day before the wheel of democracy turns out one cast and ushers in another.
