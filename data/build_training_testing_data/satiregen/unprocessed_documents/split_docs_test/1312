 The Ron Johnson era is over at J.C. Penney. The troubled department-store chain announced late Monday that Johnson is stepping down and leaving the company after just a year and a half. He is being replaced by his predecessor, Mike Ullman, who led the company for seven years prior to Johnson's arrival. J.C. Penney said in a securities filing Monday that Johnson's departure "is not the result of any disagreement with the Company or the Board of Directors on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices."  J.C. Penney had a rough 2012, and it was reflected in Ron Johnson's paycheck. The department-store chain revealed Tuesday that Johnson, its CEO, received a total of $1.9 million in compensation for 2012, down from $53.3 million in the year prior. None of the company's senior executives received bonuses, J.C. Penney said in a securities filing, "due to the company's financial results versus its goals." Johnson's compensation dropped sharply from 2011 to 2012 in large part because he received a special $52.7 million stock award upon joining the company. On October 15, 2018, Soltau began as CEO and a member of the board of JCPenney following Marvin Ellison's departure and the decline of the struggling company. She is the 25th woman currently leading a Fortune 500 company, Penney's fifth chief executive in the past decade and first woman executive. Under her leadership in 2019, the company is scheduled to close dozens of stores after shifting its focus to home goods and womenâ€™s clothes.
