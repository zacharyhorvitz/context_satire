 US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley slammed Russia at the GOP retreat in West Virginia on Thursday, definitively telling Republican lawmakers that Moscow "is not, will not, be our friend." "As long as their government has the values that it has, and as long as it conducts itself the way it does internationally," Haley said. Haley made it very clear that Russia meddled in the 2016 US election but also noted that "there is no reason to think the Russian interference made any difference between who won and lost." "The very fact that they did it is an outrageous thing, and something the administration is taking steps to prevent in the future," Haley said.  Ever wonder who might see the data from your Fitbit? It turns out it could be just about anybody -- and that has the Pentagon worried. Twenty-year-old Australian college student Nathan Ruser analyzed a heat map produced by data aggregator Strava, and what he found shows just how vulnerable troops deployed to hostile areas could be. But that vulnerability has much broader implications for the future of warfare.  The Trump administration extended protections for roughly 7,000 Syrian nationals in the US due to the ongoing civil war in the country, the agency announced Wednesday evening. But Syrians who arrived in the US after August 2016 will not be eligible under the new policy. The protections for Syria were first enacted in 2012 and shield recipients from deportation while authorizing them to work in the US. The roughly 7,000 Syrians covered under temporary protected status program will have their protections for another 18 months.
