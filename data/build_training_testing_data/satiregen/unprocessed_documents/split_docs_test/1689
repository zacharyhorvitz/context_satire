 Some of those who attended President Barack Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night savored the moment by offering up memorable reactions for his last such speech. From cheers to yawns, Obama's eighth address was a night to remember. Before Obama arrived for his final State of the Union address, Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Paul Ryan bantered. May the caption contest begin!  House Speaker Paul Ryan says he is preparing for President Barack Obama's final State of the Union address by practicing his "poker face." By tradition, the House Speaker sits right behind the President, next to Vice President Joe Biden. Ryan is used to sitting on the House floor, where he could freely react. Not anymore. Both the Speaker and the Vice President sit at the Speaker's desk, behind the President for the duration of the speech. If either is unavailable, the next highest-ranking member of the respective house substitutes. Once the chamber settles down from the President's arrival, the Speaker officially presents the President to the joint session of Congress. The President then delivers the speech from the podium at the front of the House Chamber.
