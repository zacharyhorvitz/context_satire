With his gang nearly annihilated, James trusted only the Ford brothers, Charley and Robert. Although Charley had been out on raids with James, Bob Ford was an eager new recruit. For protection, James asked the Ford brothers to move in with him and his family. James had often stayed with their sister Martha Bolton and, according to rumor, he was "smitten" with her. James's younger daughter Anne succeeded when William died in 1702. The Act of Settlement provided that, if the line of succession established in the Bill of Rights were extinguished, the crown would go to a German cousin, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and to her Protestant heirs. Sophia was a granddaughter of James VI and I through his eldest daughter, Elizabeth Stuart, the sister of Charles I. Thus, when Anne died in 1714 (less than two months after the death of Sophia), she was succeeded by George I, Sophia's son, the Elector of Hanover and Anne's second cousin.  A North Georgia man is charged with murder after authorities say he put vodka in his 4-month-old's baby bottle, leading to her death -- an incident that his public defender says was an accident. The infant girl died June 8, 2011, after she drank the vodka. Just over a year later, a DeKalb County grand jury indicted her father, Keith Antonine Furlow, on felony murder and second-degree cruelty to children, according to the court document filed Thursday. "We're at a point where we are just pursuing justice for this infant little girl," District Attorney Robert James told HLN's Nancy Grace on Friday.
