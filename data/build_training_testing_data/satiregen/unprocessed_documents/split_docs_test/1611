 A huge thunderstorm has forced hundreds of journalists out of a media tent next to the Wells Fargo Center -- the host of the Democratic National Convention. Water is dripping into the media tent, soaking electrical equipment, reporters there said on Twitter. Journalists were advised shortly after 7 p.m. ET that the media tent, which was set up as a workspace for the hundreds of journalists on hand for the convention, was not suited to withstand a direct lightning strike.  Seven protesters who breached the outer perimeter fence surrounding the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia were arrested Wednesday night, according to the Secret Service. The protesters got into the Secret Service designated zone, but did not enter the Wells Fargo Center, where the convention is being held, according to the security agency. The seven were dressed in all black and had their faces covered. They were arrested and have been taken to the Philadelphia Federal Detention Center, where they're expected to be charged with entering a restricted area.  The revolution will not be improvised. More than 50 protesters were detained by police on Monday following a tightly choreographed demonstration at an access point to the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, where the Democratic National Convention has been consumed by a series of roiling plot twists and turns. Police did not make any formal arrests, saying those taken into custody were only issued citations for disorderly conduct, as activists from Democracy Spring first attempted to block a convention entrance on Broad Street with a planned sit-in, then in a very orderly process began climbing over barricades toward the arena and into the arms of waiting officers. At one point in the early evening, delegates and attendees, many in formal attire, came within feet of sweat-soaked protesters being led away from the scene in plastic restraints.
