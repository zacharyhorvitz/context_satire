 Two streaming services and one television network went home with Oscar statuettes on Sunday night. The historic wins for Amazon, Netflix and ESPN showcase the evolving and expanding shape of the movie business. Netflix and Amazon have been investing heavily in feature films and documentaries to retain and gain subscribers. With Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in the audience at the Kodak Theatre, the Amazon Studios film "Manchester by the Sea" picked up the Oscar for best original screenplay, and the film's star Casey Affleck won the lead actor prize.  It wasn't the best night for the Oscars in terms of mistakes. In addition to what is now being referred to as "Envelopegate," in which "La La Land" was mistakenly named best picture when "Moonlight" actually won, the Academy kind of killed off the wrong person. Here's what happened: During the "In Memoriam" tribute to industry artists who died during the past year, the death of an Australian costume designer Janet Patterson was noted. But the image that appeared in the video montage was of Australian producer Jan Chapman.  Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel showered the audience with sweet treats, made a group of tourists' Hollywood dreams come true, and even tried to save the night following a historic blunder. But it was his ongoing faux-feud with Matt Damon that was truly worthy of gold Sunday night. Kimmel kicked off his night of Damon torment with a nod to the actor -- who has long been a playful target of Kimmel's --  in his monologue. "Tonight in the spirit of bringing people together, I would like to bury the hatchet with someone I've had issues with -- Matt Damon," he said.
