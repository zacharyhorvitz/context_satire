Brian Joseph of Pitchfork commended the album's exciting production, but criticized the performances of the artists: "But like any Travis Scott album, it's the sterling production that carries the project. The beats are as elegant as they are variegated. In a fatal irony, Huncho Jack's liveliness tends to come from everywhere except Quavo and Travis Scott. The protean energy that buoy their respective works are sadly absent." The master, taking the high seat in the hall, said, "On your lump of red flesh is a true man without rank who is always going in and out of the face of every one of you. Those who have not yet confirmed this, look, look!" The idea for You Don't Know Jack began while That's a Fact, Jack! was still in development. The game's title comes from the less vulgar version of the phrase "You don't know jack shit."
