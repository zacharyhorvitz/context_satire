Amy was originally a patrol officer at the 64th precinct but requested a transfer to the 99th when her captain almost sexually assaulted her shortly after her promotion to detective. She didn't tell anyone for years out of fear for what it would do to her career until she revealed it to Jake when they were investigating a sexual assault case in "He Said, She Said". Holt is married to Kevin Cozner, the Chair of Columbia University's Classics Department, and has a longstanding professional rivalry with Madeline Wuntch, with whom he came up through the ranks; while his career stalled, she kept advancing and is now his immediate superior. After he and Peralta successfully solved a major case in "The Chopper", Bureau Chief Wuntch nominated him for a promotion to head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, a promotion he accepted lest Wuntch transfer his staff to horrible posts around New York City. During the number of weeks he was in charge of Public Affairs, Holt was unable to accomplish anything significant thanks to Chief Wuntch's constant micromanaging. After helping Peralta solve a serial killer case, Holt found himself transferred back to command of the 9-9 by the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives. In season five, Amy achieves her dream of being the youngest woman to pass the Sergeant's Exam. It is not known exactly how old Amy is, but she is under 35 as of the episode "Cop-Con". In season six she is revealed to be 36 years old.
