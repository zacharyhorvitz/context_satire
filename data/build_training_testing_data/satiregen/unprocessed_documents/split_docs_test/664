Of the three artists who won all four awards, two of them won all four at once: Christopher Cross in 1980, and Billie Eilish in 2020 making her the youngest artist to do so at the age of 18. Adele won the Best New Artist award in 2009 and the other three in 2012 and 2017. Christopher Cross and Billie Eilish are the only main artists to receive the Grammys for Album of the Year as well as for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist in one ceremony. Adele is the first artist to receive the award for Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist, nonconsecutively, and first woman to accomplish this feat. Only five artists have won both Album of the Year and Best New Artist in the same year: Bob Newhart in 1961, Christopher Cross in 1981, Lauryn Hill in 1999, Norah Jones in 2003 and Billie Eilish in 2020. Of the 54 awards presented in the category since its inception, the honor has been presented to 26 solo female artists, 18 duos or groups, and 11 solo male artists. Between 1997 and 2003, all the winners were solo female artists. Also, from 1993 to 2005, no winner was a solo male artist. In 2006, John Legend broke this trend, which started with Marc Cohn in 1992.
