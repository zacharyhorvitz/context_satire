In 1864, the Honourable William Young purchased the heavily indebted Halifax Mechanic’s Library and donated the collection to establish the city’s first free public library, The Citizens’ Free Library. Anyone "above the age of 18 who were of a known and respectable nature" could borrow one book at a time. The library found a permanent home in 1890 on the second floor of City Hall, where the office of the Mayor of Halifax is now located. It served as city hall of independent Woodlawn, Alabama for only two years, before the city was incorporated into Birmingham. It included "most of the town's public functions within its walls— city offices, the court and jail, the fire department, an auditorium for meetings and performances, and the first branch of the Greater Birmingham Library, which began with 890 books. Relieved of its city hall status after the annexation, the upstairs became used entirely by the Library (they did not build separate quarters until 1950), while the street level was converted on one side to retail spaces, the longest-term occupant of which was the Morgan Brothers Department Store. The fire station remained until 1928, and subsequently that half of the first floor was converted to commercial use. As Fish argues in Black Power/White Control TWO picked issues that mobilized resident participation, and at the same time built power for the organization to take on large outside entities like the University and the City (i.e. Mayor Daley). The group took part in the flurry of activity surrounding the Freedom Rides and the Civil Rights Movement by loading up over 40 buses of people from Woodlawn and riding to City Hall to register to vote. They also rallied against slum landlords and cheating business owners.
