Shapiro did just that within his first week as Pennsylvania attorney general in 2017, when he was briefed on grand jury investigations into sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. He decided to put the "full force" of his office behind continuing the investigation.  For the first time, Pope Francis has acknowledged the sexual abuse of nuns by priests and bishops as a "problem" in the Catholic Church, saying that "we've been working on this for some time."

"There have been priests and also bishops who have done that," the Pope said of sexually abusing nuns. "And I believe that it may still be being done.
