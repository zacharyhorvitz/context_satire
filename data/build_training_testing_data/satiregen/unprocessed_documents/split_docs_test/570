Loyola University Maryland was founded by the Society of Jesus in the tradition of Ignatius of Loyola. The Society of Jesus, and therefore Loyola University Maryland, operate according to the mandate Ad maiorem Dei gloriam (AMDG), directing their ends toward that which brings forth the "greater glory of God". This cornerstone of the Jesuit philosophy functions to remind students that their education is meant to be applied toward the betterment of humanity and the worship of God, in particular. Loyola's focus on cura personalis, or the education of the whole person, functions to attain that end. Business to business (B2B) research is inevitably more complicated than consumer research. The researchers need to know what type of multi-faceted approach will answer the objectives, since seldom is it possible to find the answers using just one method. Finding the right respondents is crucial in B2B research since they are often busy, and may not want to participate. Encouraging them to “open up” is yet another skill required of the B2B researcher. The National Institute for Consumer Research (Norwegian: Statens institutt for forbruksforskning, SIFO) is a consumer affairs research institute based in Oslo, Norway. It has researchers in both social and natural sciences. Albeit non-biased, it is not organizationally independent, as it is subordinate to the Norwegian Ministry of Children and Family Affairs, who appoints its board of directors and provides the funding. The institute has 55 employees.
