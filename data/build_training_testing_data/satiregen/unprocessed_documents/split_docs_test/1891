 CBS News has announced criteria for Saturday's Republican primary debate that could keep one or more candidates off the stage. Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are all guaranteed an invitation to the debate because they finished in the top three in the Iowa caucuses. For the other candidates, it will require finishing in the top five in Tuesday night's New Hampshire primary, or in the top five in an average of national and South Carolina polls. Those polls must be approved by CBS News and released before noon on Feb. 12.  The Republican presidential candidates left in the race after the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary came out swinging Saturday night during their last debate before the South Carolina primary. CBS News moderated the heated exchange in Greenville, South Carolina. Here are the night's most memorable moments in GIFs. The candidates first took to the stage and observed a moment of silence for the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.  Fast food and other low-paid workers are planning to protest outside Saturday's Republican presidential debate in Greenville, South Carolina. The protesters at the "Fight for $15" rally will be demanding a $15 an hour minimum wage and the right to unionize. At 1pm the protest will kick off with a walkout and will culminate in a 7 pm rally outside the debate. It comes just one week before the state's primary.
