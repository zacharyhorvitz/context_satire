Parekh has remained unmarried, claiming that her reputation of being unapproachable made people hesitate in asking for her hand in marriage. In her memoir "The Hit Girl", she confirmed rumours that she was romantically involved with director Nasir Hussain who was already married, but out of respect for both their families, she couldn't marry him. Previously, Parekh would only state that she had a longtime boyfriend but declined to elaborate on the relationship, only stating that "it was nice while it lasted." She said she had not seen Nasir Hussain during the last year of his life, as he became reclusive because of his wife's death, but she did speak to him the day before he died in 2002. Guru (Madhavan) wants to be an MD for a company under his boss Krishna (Abbas). Krishna is a successful entrepreneur married to Sheila (Brinda Parekh), but his major problem is his playboy nature. Guru hopes that Krishna will make him an MD, so that he can also become a boss and make money. He tries to do everything to please him. Malvika goes to the shop to investigate, where the assistant says that her eyesight is perfect, but her vision is very weak. Malvika does not realize what he means, but after learning that the assistant did not turn up that day, she realizes that she talked with the killer (whom she could not see, as the room was dark). Later, she finds out from the list of customers that a person named Amod Parekh (Jackie Shroff), also with eye power -2, visited the same optical shop on the days when all the three murdered persons visited the shop, and believes him to be the killer.
