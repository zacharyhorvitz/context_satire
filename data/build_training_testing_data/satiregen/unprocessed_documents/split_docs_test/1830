 Over the last year, researchers have found nearby exoplanets that could potentially support life, like Proxima b and the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets. Now, a "super-Earth" has been found 39 light-years away, according to new research in the journal Nature. Researchers believe it may be one of the best candidates for a closer look in the future by the James Webb Space Telescope, which NASA will launch in 2018. LHS 1140b, named for the small, faint red dwarf star it orbits, has all the right features.  A large asteroid is whizzing by Earth this week, and NASA has the images to prove it. The space rock, known by the very dull name of 2014 JO25, was expected to safely fly by Earth on Wednesday night, according to NASA. Radar images obtained by NASA a day earlier show a peanut-shaped asteroid that rotates about once every five hours. "Although there is no possibility for the asteroid to collide with our planet, this will be a very close approach for an asteroid of this size," the space agency said in a statement.  NASA announced this week exciting results from a spacecraft observing Saturn's moon Enceladus and Jupiter's moon Europa. Equipment on the Cassini probe detected some of the required conditions and building blocks for life on both moons. For those like myself, who thrill at any discovery that suggests Earth's creatures may not be alone in the universe, the findings capture our imagination anew. But does Cassini bring our imaginings closer to reality?
