 Mars may seem inhospitably dry now, but NASA's rovers have shown that water was once abundant on the Red Planet. Photos gathered during NASA's missions orbiting Mars have revealed that the planet was once home to raging rivers -- and that those rivers existed more recently than previously thought, according to a new study. The rivers were two times wider than any on Earth, according to the deep riverbeds they left carved into the surface, and they could be found at hundreds of locations across the planet. NASA's photos showed well-preserved river channels, deltas and fan-shaped masses of material called alluvium that is carried and deposited by water.  This week, a super-telescope peered into the atmosphere of an exoplanet, the world's largest Tyrannosaurus rex fossil was announced, and a global network of rivers was found on Mars. The Hubble telescope also spied an asteroid as it broke apart, and the all-female spacewalk didn't happen because of a spacesuit fail. Here's everything you missed this week in space and science. One stormy exoplanet For the first time, a super-telescope has revealed a complex atmosphere on an exoplanet, according to a new study. The company was not the first to recently announce that it would be changing the use of artificial flavors in its products. In 2015, food giant, General Mills proposed an initiative that noted that all of the artificial ingredients it was using in its products would be dropped by 2017. This meant a reformulation of many of the cereals, with alternatives that were more suitable to the palates of humans. A key aspect in that proposed initiative was that the cereal, Trix, would no longer have the blue and green colors forming a new iteration of the cereal.
