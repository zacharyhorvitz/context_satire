 President Donald Trump appeared to contradict his most senior security officials Monday, downplaying recent attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman that his administration has blamed on Iran as "very minor." And days after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration continues to consider military options for dealing with Iran, Trump dismissed the idea in an interview with Time Magazine. Asked whether he was considering military action against Tehran, the President told Time, "I wouldn't say that. I can't say that at all."  President Donald Trump and his national security adviser, John Bolton, are engaged in an ongoing debate about how to handle Iran, a senior White House official told CNN. Trump moved to ease tensions with Iran on Thursday morning after Tehran downed a US drone near the Persian Gulf. In doing so, he struck a starkly different tone on Iran from Bolton and other senior security aides. After months of escalating steps by Iran and the US, Trump said Iran's attack on the drone was probably an unintentional "mistake."  United States national security adviser John Bolton warned Sunday that Iran should not "mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness," days after President Donald Trump called off a retaliatory military strike against Iran after the downing of an American drone. Bolton also warned of the possibility of a strike against Iran in the future during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. "Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness. No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East," Bolton, who has publicly and repeatedly called for regime change in Tehran in the past, said.
