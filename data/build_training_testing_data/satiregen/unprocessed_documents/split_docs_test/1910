After the relief of Komárom on 26 April, and the Hungarian commanders’ council of war's decision of 29 April to besiege Buda, I. Corps departed from Komárom towards Buda next day. Formerly led by General János Damjanich, it was now commanded by General József Nagysándor, who took his excellent predecessor's place, because of an accident to the latter which rendered him unable to serve. This departure was in accordance with the orders issued the same day by the High Command of the Hungarian army, requiring all the designated troops to do so. However, Görgei was quickly convinced by those who wanted to liberate the castle of Buda first. So he changed his mind and supported the second choice. The reason was that although the first seemed very attractive, it would have been nearly impossible for it to succeed. While the Hungarian army gathered before Komárom had fewer than 27,000 men, the imperial army awaiting them around Pozsony and Vienna had 75,633, of which its effective combat strength was 54,443 with 237 guns, so it was twice the size of Görgei's force. After the failure of the assault on the night of 17–18 May, Görgey ordered a detachment of a few companies to harass the defenders every night until 2 am. At 2 o'clock all the firing stopped. Görgei's plan was to make the defenders believe that after 2 am they would be safe and could rest until morning. Then, on 20 May, he issued the order to storm the castle.
