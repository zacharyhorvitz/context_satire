Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to BSkyB in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market, as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar. Many leagues are composed of friends, family, co-workers, and even strangers that are in the fantasy league to prove who is the greatest "couch coach". Millions of dollars are won and lost each year in fantasy sports league betting. Some leagues are managed by players in the leagues, while other leagues are run by independent businesses. Though the traditional fame of the game was for respect and pride within groups,  gambling has gained a more prominent role. Some Fantasy Football leagues wager things other than money, such as the loser of the league fulfilling a punishment. For example, the last place finisher must get a tattoo, and that tattoo has to be of what the winner of the league wants. The only thing that the loser gets any say in is the location of the tattoo. The owners of the teams have to sign a contract before the season to agree to the punishment if they lose.
