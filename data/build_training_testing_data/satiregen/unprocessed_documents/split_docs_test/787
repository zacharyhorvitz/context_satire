 Wherever I go, terror seems to follow. I used to go jogging by Westminster Bridge when I lived in London, and my office was just a few blocks away from the World Trade Center when I lived in New York. I don't know how many hundreds of times I have walked where terrorism took innocent lives. I also studied in Paris, just a few blocks away from the Bataclan and RÃ©publique, sites of the 2015 attacks that left over a hundred people dead and many more injured.  On Thursday afternoon, a van rammed into a crowd of people in Barcelona, killing 13 people and injuring at least 100. It's the worst attack on Spanish soil since the 2004 Madrid bombings, which killed 191 people and injured more than 1,800. The deadly assault was followed hours later by a second possible terror attack in Cambrils, south of Barcelona, where police shot dead five suspected terrorists. As police search for answers, here's what we know so far.  The football world has united in paying tribute to the victims of Thursday's Barcelona attacks which killed 14 people and injured at least 100. Lionel Messi, who plays for Barcelona football club and is one of the world's most revered players, sent his condolences to the families and friends of the victims, saying he totally rejected "any act of violence," while Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo and other world stars also offered their sympathy. Barcelona and Real Madrid, Spain's biggest football clubs, both held a minute's silence before training on Friday. The attack on Las Ramblas, a predominantly pedestrian zone in the heart of the Catalan capital, was the worst on Spanish soil since the 2004 Madrid bombings, which killed 191 people and injured more than 1,800.
