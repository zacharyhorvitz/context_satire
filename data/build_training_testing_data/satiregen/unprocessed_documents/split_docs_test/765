The town established on the chosen site was given the name of Salem (from "Shalom" meaning "Peace", after the Canaanite city mentioned in the Book of Genesis) chosen for it by the Moravians' late patron, Count Zinzendorf. On January 6, 1766, the first tree was felled for the building of Salem. Salem was a typical Moravian settlement congregation with the public buildings of the congregation grouped around a central square, today Salem Square. These included the church, a Brethren's House and a Sisters' House for the unmarried members of the Congregation, which owned all the property in town. Wesley Hanes died at age fifty-three young age  in 1903, just two years after creating the business. His son, James Gordon Hanes, would be responsible for the 1963 merger with P. H. Hanes Knitting and for making Hanes Hosiery one of largest producers in the world of seamless stretch nylon hosiery for women. Known by his middle name, Wesley Hanes owned the expensive clothing company in partnership with his brother, Pleasant  Henderson Hanes. Using some of the proceeds of their sale of the business to R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Wesley Hanes went into the manufacturing of stockings while his brother set up an underwear manufacturing business under the name P.H. Hanes Knitting Company.
