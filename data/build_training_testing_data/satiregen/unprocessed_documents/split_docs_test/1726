 On Thursday night, the five remaining Republican presidential candidates faced off at the CNN debate in Texas -- the final debate before Super Tuesday. As always, what was spoken was important, but body language really said it all. The ultimate Republican power couple -- former President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara -- made a cameo.

In South Carolina Saturday night Bush suspended his White House campaign and acknowledged a painful reality: The country was not interested in a third President Bush. Bush's disappointing finish in the Palmetto State became the final straw for his floundering campaign. The end was all the more personal because the former Florida governor had poured his energy into the state, invoking his family's political legacy at one campaign stop after another and facing down voters who questioned his campaign strategy.  Jeb Bush always remained optimistic.
