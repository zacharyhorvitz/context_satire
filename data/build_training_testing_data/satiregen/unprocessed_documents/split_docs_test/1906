 It took just seconds, but Jeb Bush was already running a mini victory lap at his first campaign event following his well-received debate performance the night before. Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger had just introduced the former Florida governor at a town hall here Friday afternoon, and Bush explained that Kinzinger typically appears on news shows for him the mornings after debates. "Today was a little easier for him than the previous debates," Bush said. The audience, which was packed into a small, lodge-type venue, broke out into laughter and applause.  Jeb Bush ditched his normal walk-out song Thursday night to play the Beach Boys' "Barbara Ann." That's because his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, was in the house. The 90-year-old matriarch of the Bush family, wife of a former president, and mother of another, walked out with her towering son (and a walker emblazoned with a Jeb! sticker) at a town hall as the larger-than-normal audience buzzed with a rally-like energy.  Jeb Bush, battling against low poll numbers in the last days before Tuesday's primary, attempted Wednesday to convince voters he's still worth supporting in what will likely be a tight New Hampshire race. The former Florida governor told CNN's Jake Tapper on "The Lead" the race is "wide open" -- pushing back on New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's claim that it's between Rubio and himself. Bush also took swipes at Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, comparing the two first-term senators to then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama in 2008.
