The James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality was launched on September 1, 2016. The Stone Center expanded and replaced the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) Center, which opened its doors at the Graduate Center in 2009. The mission of the Stone Center is to build and disseminate knowledge related to the causes, nature, and consequences of multiple forms of socio-economic inequality. The Center's associated faculty and students share a commitment to scholarship that is quantitative, data-driven, interdisciplinary, and policy-oriented, and that addresses questions that are cross-nationally comparative and/or global in scope. The IRB scrutinizes the study for both medical safety and protection of the patients involved in the study, before it allows the researcher to begin the study. It may require changes in study procedures or in the explanations given to the patient. A required yearly "continuing review" report from the investigator updates the IRB on the progress of the study and any new safety information related to the study. The Research Authority is responsible for promoting, encouraging and fostering academic research, with special emphasis on expanding research projects funded by foundations and public bodies. The Research Authority is home to some 70 research institutes and centers including The Herzl Institute for the Study of Zionism, the Zinman Institute of Archeology, the International Center for Health, Law and Ethics, the Center for National Security Studies, the Center for Law and Technology, the Bucerius Institute for Contemporary German Society and History and the Haifa Center for Marine Strategy Research.
