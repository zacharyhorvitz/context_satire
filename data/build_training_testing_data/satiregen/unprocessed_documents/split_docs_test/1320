 Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign on Sunday responded to an attack from the National Rifle Association that called her proposed gun reform legislation "ridiculous," a move that comes as the nation is still reeling from two recent mass shootings. Harris has proposed to sign executive orders that mandate near universal background checks and closing the so-called boyfriend loophole among others if Congress doesn't act on gun legislation within 100 days of her inauguration, should she become president.
