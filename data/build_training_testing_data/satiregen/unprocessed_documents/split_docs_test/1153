 N.J. Gov. Chris Christie's speech to the Republican National Convention proved he might have made a good vice presidential pick for Donald Trump, especially when it comes to the traditional vice presidential role of savaging the opposition. Christie tore into Hillary Clinton with gusto on Tuesday night, leading the assembled delegates in a mock prosecution of Clinton for the "crimes" of pursuing foreign policies that failed to bring peace to the Middle East, stop the rise of ISIS, contain aggressive Russian President Vladimir Putin or topple the dictatorial Castro regime in Cuba. Christie then proceeded to criticize Clinton's diplomatic efforts in Libya, Nigeria, Syria, Russia and Cuba, arguing in each case that she was too soft on dictators and terrorists.  Chris Christie riled up the crowd Tuesday night during a blistering attack against Hillary Clinton at the Republican National Convention. It wasn't quite the role he was hoping to play this week. The New Jersey governor, who was unsuccessful in his own 2016 White House bid, was on Donald Trump's shortlist to become his running mate, just within grasp of making it onto the presidential ticket after all. Instead, he watched Indiana Gov.  Donald Trump claimed the mantle Tuesday as the Republican presidential nominee, capping a stunning rise to power for his insurgent campaign as a boisterous showing by his family and friends revived his convention after a rocky start. Chris Christie, shaking off the disappointment of being passed over as Trump's running mate, performed a show trial of Hillary Clinton, whipping the crowd into frenzied chants of "Lock her Up! Lock her up!" Trump's son, Donald Jr., marked himself as a rising political star, sketching a portrait of his father as a champion of the working man who could unleash America's potential.
