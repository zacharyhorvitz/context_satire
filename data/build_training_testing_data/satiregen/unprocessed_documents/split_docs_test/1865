Dominique Francon is the heroine of The Fountainhead, described by Rand as "the woman for a man like Howard Roark". Rand described Dominique as similar to herself "in a bad mood". For most of the novel, the character operates from what Rand viewed as wrong ideas. Believing that the values she admires cannot survive in the real world, she chooses to turn away from them so that the world cannot harm her. Professor Kingsfield refers to the "Hairy Hand" case in the opening scene of the popular movie The Paper Chase. Harvard contract law classes actually began with this lesson for many years as part of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.'s theory that the study of contract law should begin with the remedies for a broken promise. The family did not learn about the case's use in The Paper Chase until Gail's mother, Edith, saw the movie during its first run in 1973. The sequence in the bar was the last Perry Mason scene to be filmed. In her sole appearance in the series, Gail Patrick Jackson broke the rule against ad libs. The script called for her to say, "I wouldn't take that show if they begged me. Who wants that time slot?"
