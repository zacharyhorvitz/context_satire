 Even "Saturday Night Live" has had enough of this election. In Saturday's cold open sketch for the final episode of the NBC variety show before Election Day, Alec Baldwin and Kate McKinnon broke out of their Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton characters to stop the mudslinging of 2016. "I'm sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this," Baldwin as himself -- but dressed as Trump -- said to McKinnon.  When I visit a foreign city, it is the public spaces and shared experiences that I remember, as much as the facades or interiors of individual buildings. Architecture is not about buildings viewed in isolation, but about the experience of cityscapes, about how buildings respond to topography, frame space and create the structure of cities. I love the way that narrow alleyways, with the sunshine turned to shadow on buildings, pavements and pedestrians, suddenly explode into the dazzling light of piazzas. Public spaces -- our streets and squares, parks and pavements -- are the stages for public life; the public realm is at the heart of our life as social animals. Times Square is a major commercial intersection, tourist destination, entertainment center, and neighborhood in the Midtown Manhattan section of New York City, at the junction of Broadway and Seventh Avenue. Brightly lit by numerous billboards and advertisements, it stretches from West 42nd to West 47th Streets, and is sometimes referred to as "the Crossroads of the World", "the Center of the Universe", "the heart of the Great White Way", and "the heart of the world". One of the world's busiest pedestrian areas, it is also the hub of the Broadway Theater District and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. Times Square is one of the world's most visited tourist attractions, drawing an estimated 50 million visitors annually.
