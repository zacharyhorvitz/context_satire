Behind his initially cheerful facade, Darius is a psychopath who tampers with the mail of the people on his route, rewriting letters and smashing packages, among other acts of vandalism. Aiding Darius is Daniel Everson, a teenage delinquent who had become disillusioned after discovering that his older sister, Beth, and his best friend, Jay, are dating, and after being informed by Darius that he is adopted. Unbeknownst to Daniel however, Darius is a serial killer who has begun murdering those who become suspicious of him, such as a gas meter man, and Daniel's girlfriend, Veronica. The more aggressive Chrome followed in 1993, produced by Gil Norton. With this album, the band began to shed its original shoegazing tag, while still making skillful use of atmospherics, such as on the song "Fripp". In a 2007 interview, Rob Dickinson said that members of Death Cab for Cutie and Interpol told him that without this album, their bands "wouldn't exist." Dread Central's Mike Phalin gave the film a 1Â½ out of 5, and wrote, "The Mailman just never gets to any sort of peak or level that draws in the viewer" and "With so much potential to be a deep thriller about family ties and morals, it is hard to believe The Mailman ends up being just another one of those cheap films that goes nowhere and does nothing". A 2/5 was awarded by Richard Scheib of Moria, who noted that while The Mailman was bogged down by its low-budget, sub-par cinematography, and melodramatic direction, it was still "a wonderfully sordid little film" with memorable performances by Bryan W. Lukasik, Ari Tinnen, and Rob Arbogast.
