Elmo is a Muppet character on the children's television show Sesame Street. He is a furry red monster with a falsetto voice, who hosts the last full fifteen-minute segment (five minutes after 2017) on Sesame Street, "Elmo's World", which is aimed at toddlers. He also speaks to himself in the third person. He was most often puppeteered by Kevin Clash. Clash resigned from Sesame Workshop on November 20, 2012, and released a statement saying, "Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work 'Sesame Street' is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately." Sesame Workshop also released a statement: "Unfortunately, the controversy surrounding Kevin's personal life has become a distraction that none of us want, and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has resigned from 'Sesame Street.'" They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Clash's understudy and would take over his roles on the show. In November 2012, at the age of 52, Clash came out publicly as gay in response to the allegations that led to his resignation from Sesame Workshop, stating, "I am a gay man. I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter." Clash's privacy about his sexual orientation ended when the gossip website TMZ broke the news that a college student from Pennsylvania was claiming that he had a sexual relationship with Clash that began when he was 16. Clash responded to TMZ and admitted to a sexual relationship with the accuser, but countered that the relationship only happened after his accuser was a consenting adult.
