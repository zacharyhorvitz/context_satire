 A diversity paradox looms over the Democrats' hopes of recapturing the White House in 2020. The field of Democratic presidential candidates includes the most racial minorities ever, and more minorities will likely vote next year in the party's primaries than ever before. Yet four white contenders consistently lead in state and national polls, partly because of the outsized influence of the two virtually all-white states that lead off the election calendar, Iowa and New Hampshire. Those four white contenders -- former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens.  It's popular -- particularly on Twitter! -- to blast former Vice President Joe Biden and declare his presidential hopes dead. And given his poor fundraising through the end of September and his, uh, middling debate performances, there are some real facts behind that perception. But one of the under-told storylines of the 2020 campaign to date is that despite the defeatist conventional wisdom, the support for the former vice president has -- and continues -- to show surprising resilience. Criticism of Buttigieg's handling of racial issues in South Bend has led to doubts about his ability to attract Black voters. Following the controversial shooting of Eric Logan, an African American man, by a white South Bend police officer in June, 2019, Buttigieg was compelled to hold off his campaign to commit his undivided focus to the emerging public reaction. Buttigieg convened a local town hall on June 23, where he heard the grievances of disaffected activists in the African American community as well as relatives of Eric Logan. The local police union accused Buttigieg of making decisions for political gain.
