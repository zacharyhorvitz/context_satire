Ramon "REO" Owen created the instrumental three years before its inclusion on Tha Carter IV. The producer, Reo" Owen of the Soundkillers, with help of Mike Caren, Atlantic Records A&R, was able to get this recording, which already had Bruno Mars singing the hook, heard by industry "heavy-hitters" including rappers Kanye West, Drake, and Nas. They rejected it. Lil Wayne liked the track and decided to keep it. "Girls Around the World" is a song by American recording artist Lloyd.
