The 2016 Democratic Party presidential debates occurred among candidates in the campaign for the party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates. In February 2016, Clinton's and Sanders's campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more, for a total of ten. Critics alleged that the small number of debates and the schedule, with four of the ten on Saturday or Sunday nights, were part of the DNC's deliberate attempt to protect the front-runner, Hillary Clinton. The 2016 Democratic Party presidential debates pitted candidates in the race for the Democratic Party's nomination for the President of the United States. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates. Critics alleged that the small number of debates and the schedule, with half of the debates on Saturday or Sunday nights, were part of the DNC's deliberate attempt to protect the front-runner, Hillary Clinton. In February 2016 Clinton's and Sanders's campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more debates for a total of ten.  And so it ends. Sort of. On Tuesday, Bernie Sanders is due to appear with Hillary Clinton at a rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where many expect Sanders will endorse his former rival. It's worth reflecting on the Vermont senator's unlikely journey as a presidential candidate.
