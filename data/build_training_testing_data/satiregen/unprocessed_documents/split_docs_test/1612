 Anthony Scaramucci is set on living his best life. After five days working at the White House, the shortest-lived communications director stint in history, Scaramucci told TMZ while departing the Trump International Hotel in Washington Tuesday that he's "working on being the best person I can be." Scaramucci's comments come a day after he was pushed out from his White House gig. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the move was in order to "give chief of staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team."  Anthony Scaramucci is out as White House communications director, the latest sign of chaos inside the Trump administration. Scaramucci's ouster is the most recent high-profile departure from the Trump White House. Chief of Staff Reince Priebus resigned at the end of last week, replaced by John Kelly, whose first day is Monday. "Anthony Scaramucci will be leaving his role as White House Communications Director," White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement Monday afternoon.  Anthony Scaramucci, the new White House communications director who was brought in to bring order to a press shop in turmoil, called into CNN's "New Day" on Thursday and all but blamed chief of staff Reince Priebus for leaking information. In the remarkable interview, which lasted for more than a half hour, the developing power struggle inside the West Wing was on full display, with Scaramucci at one point warning that "the fish stinks from the head down." Scaramucci, whose relationship with Priebus has been fraught since he was initially unable to secure a White House job after President Donald Trump's election, did little to show his relationship with Priebus was changing and said it was up to the chief of staff to show he was not leaking. Hours earlier, the White House communications director -- who notably announced last week that he reports to Trump, not Priebus -- copied the chief of staff in a tweet about leaks before deleting it.
