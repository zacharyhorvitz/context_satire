Theorist Lance Bennett explains that excluding a few major events in recent history, it is uncommon for a group big enough to be labeled a mass, to be watching the same news via the same medium of mass production. Bennett's critique of 21st Century mass media argues that today it is more common for a group of people to be receiving different news stories, from completely different sources, and thus, mass media has been re-invented. As discussed above, filters would have been applied to original mass medias when the journalists decided what would or wouldn't be printed. In late 2002, Jason Herbison from Inside Soap revealed that Rugg had filmed her final scenes as Brodie. Of her exit she stated that "I was sad to leave but I think the time has come to go. The show has enabled me to do a lot of incredible things I wouldn't normally have been able to do." Lifestyle changes have been increasing slowly since the introduction of media. Media â€“ films, television shows, magazines, and more recently, the Internet (i.e. self-written blogs and popular websites) are the main sources of lifestyle influence around the world. Lifestyle changes include how people eat, dress, and communicate.Lifestyle trends have always been influenced by the wealthy and famous, whether they are spotted at leisure or in a paid advertisement.
