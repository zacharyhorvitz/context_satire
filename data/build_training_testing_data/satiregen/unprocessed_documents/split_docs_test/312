 Longtime political operatives here sat back and watched with amusement this past week as Donald Trump rose in the New Hampshire polls and sparked a media frenzy with his second place position. "The Donald" would have his moment, they said. But by next February's primary, they had no doubt that it would be a distant memory. A CNN/WMUR New Hampshire Primary poll released Thursday found Trump in second in the GOP pack at 11%, behind former Florida governor Jeb Bush at 16%.  Don't expect a new season this fall: Donald Trump is giving up "The Apprentice" so that he can run for president. The Republican real estate mogul cited the popular reality show as evidence that he "gave up hundreds of millions of dollars in deals and potential, you know, things that I do," in an interview aired Sunday with CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union." "In all fairness, I don't want it to sound trivial, NBC renewed 'The Apprentice,' because we had a great season last season. And they would love me not to be doing this, I will tell you right now," Trump said.  The odds are too small to calculate that Donald Trump will become President of the United States. The fact that he's doing well in early New Hampshire polls, however, may spur some sales of tranquilizers among the political class. Trump keeps reminding us that he'll bring sound business principles to the federal government. But he has failed so many times there are Top 10 lists on the Internet of his biggest screw-ups.
