Oreo cookies are distributed worldwide through a variety of sales and marketing channels. As their popularity continues to grow, so too does the amount of distribution that comes with it. According to the Kraft Foods company, the Oreo is the "World's Best Selling Cookie". In March 2012, Time magazine reported that Oreo cookies were available in more than 100 different countries. Nabisco's trademark, a diagonal ellipse with a series of antenna-like lines protruding from the top ("Orb and Cross" or Globus cruciger), forms the base of its logo and can be seen imprinted on Oreo cookies in addition to Nabisco product boxes and literature. It has been claimed in company promotional material to be  an early European symbol for quality. It may be derived from a medieval Italian printer's mark that represented "the triumph of the moral and spiritual over the evil and the material", "Christ's redemption of the world", or to represent the act of winnowing, separating grain from chaff. The RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout was, at the time, widely considered to be the preeminent example of corporate and executive greed. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar published Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, a successful book about the events which was later turned into a television movie for HBO.
