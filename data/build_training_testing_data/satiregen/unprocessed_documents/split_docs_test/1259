Later that evening, a memorial event is held at the local VFW, to which Lt. Col. Strobl was invited earlier. The local veterans, along with PFC Phelps's sergeant (who was with him when he was killed) and others, all welcome Lt. Col. Strobl with sincere gratitude for "bringing Chance home." They reminisce about Chance's outgoing personality, and recount some war stories of his, including, eventually later in the evening, the sergeant's story of what happened the day that PFC Phelps was killed (apparently in the firefight following the IED attack on their convoy, heard at the beginning of the film, in which PFC Phelps was the gunner on a machine gun and was able to draw the focus of much of the enemy fire, allowing for his comrades to safely find cover for themselves). As the attendees of the memorial leave at the end of the evening, Lt. Col. Strobl remarks to the U.S. Marine 1st. After unloading, Lt. Col. Strobl is greeted by the funeral director, and they load PFC Phelp's casket for the final part of his journey. Along the way, an impromptu funeral procession forms along the highway, as people in passing cars see Lt. Col. Strobl and realize what the hearse is carrying. After arriving in the town where PFC Phelps's parents reside, the Lt. Col. is greeted by a younger fellow Marine, who along with a partner had driven up from Salt Lake City a few days earlier to inform PFC Phelps's family of his death. The men proceed into the funeral home, where the younger Marine suggests that this would be a good time to place some personal items that PFC Phelps's family had asked him to place into the casket; Lt. Col. Strobl agrees, and despite it being a closed casket ceremony, insists that he wants to make sure PFC Phelps's uniform is correct and in place. Prior to the funeral the next day, Lt. Col. Strobl meets PFC Phelps's family for the first time, and makes a point of mentioning that PFC Phelps was treated with great care and dignity across his entire journey. He hands over PFC Phelps's personal effects, as well as a letter from PFC Phelps's platoon leader. He finally leaves them with the cross that was given to him by a flight attendant, saying that eventually he realized it was not really given to him, only that he was carrying it for them. With the father's voiceover reading the platoon leader's letter in the background, we see PFC Phelps receive a funeral with full military honors, and his divorced parents are each presented with a flag, "on behalf of the President, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and a grateful nation," honoring their son.
