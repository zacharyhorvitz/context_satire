In 1995, controversy arose over the exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum with the display of the Enola Gay, the Superfortress used by the United States to drop the first atomic bomb used in World War II. The American Legion and Air Force Association believed the exhibit put forward only one side of the debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that it emphasized the effect on victims without discussing its use within the overall context of the war. The Smithsonian changed the exhibit, displaying the aircraft only with associated technical data and without discussion of its historic role in the war.  Friday marks the 77th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. While the day has always been a solemn reminder of the cost of war, it is increasingly becoming a reminder of the cost of time, as well. The country is fortunate enough to have five remaining survivors who were aboard the USS Arizona on December 7, 1941. According to a report from Hawaii News Now, every year, some of these American veterans have been present at the Pearl Harbor memorial ceremonies in Hawaii. The site selection committee did not issue its recommendation until January 31, 2006â€”a full 13 months late. It recommended the site west of the National Museum of American History. The area was part of the Washington Monument grounds, but had been set aside for a museum or other building in the L'Enfant Plan of 1791 and the McMillan Plan of 1902. The United States Department of State originally planned to build its headquarters there in the early 20th century, and the National World War II Memorial Advisory Board had considered the parcel in 1995.
