 It's over. Donald Trump is the Republican nominee. He just added Nevada to the growing list of caucus primary wins, and while he needs more delegates to clinch it, who the heck can stop him now? READ: Chris Christie endorses Trump He is leading in national polls and in many state polls; he's succeeded in upending rivals such as Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush and Ben Carson; and there's no one in sight who can stop him.  Local media, social media and sources on the ground in Nevada are reporting ballot shortages and identifications going unchecked at Tuesday's Republican caucuses. Jeremy Hughes, a Nevada strategist for Marco Rubio, said he was hearing about extensive problems at caucus sites across the state. At his own caucus site in Clark County, he said volunteers were checking in voters to caucus without checking their IDs, including one member of the Rubio team. Hughes said he reported the violations to Sue Lowden, the former chairwoman of the Nevada Republican Party who happened to be at that caucus site, and she reprimanded the woman.  Despite Donald Trump's commanding win in the Nevada caucus Tuesday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus is holding off crowning the Republican front-runner as the standard-bearer -- for now. "I think it's pretty clear we're going to embrace whoever the nominee is. I embrace all of these candidates," he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota Wednesday on "New Day." "Whoever the nominee ends up becoming they're going to join the biggest RNC operation we've put together."
