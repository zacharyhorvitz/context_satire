 Members of the House intelligence committee's Russia investigation are gearing up for Tuesday's testimony from top White House adviser and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner -- with plans to pry into his public statement. The intensity could vary starkly from Kushner's appearance before the Senate's Russia investigators just a day earlier, with House Democrats saying they plan to probe for holes in Kushner's 11-page public statement and also pry into his role. Kushner's testimony Tuesday is behind closed doors. And, in a twist, House intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes -- who temporarily stepped aside from running the House Russia probe in April -- said he might show up to Tuesday's interview of Kushner.  Jared Kushner met Thursday with Sen. Lindsey Graham on Capitol Hill, though the South Carolina Republican said the two discussed immigration policy and not congressional investigations into Russian interference in last year's US presidential election. Kushner is expected to appear before the Senate intelligence committee Monday in its ongoing Russia investigation. His closed-door session with the committee will be with staff, sources say. It is not yet clear when he would meet with senators.  The top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee said Sunday he did not believe no one told President Donald Trump about a meeting last year between top members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said in an interview on CNN's "State of the Union" that he wanted to question everyone involved in the meeting as part of the committee's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. "Whether we'll be able to get the Russian nationals to come over and testify is an open question," Warner said. "Those people that our committee has jurisdiction over, the Americans, I sure as heck want to talk to them."
