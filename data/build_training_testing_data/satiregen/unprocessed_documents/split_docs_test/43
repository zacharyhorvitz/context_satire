Duke TIP was founded in 1980 by a grant from the Duke Endowment. At the time, the goal of the program was to identify and provide educational opportunities to help the children reach their full educational potential. The program initially focused on seventh graders, and has since expanded to grades four through twelve, allowing the program full reach of middle and high school students. On September 29, 2007, Duke President Brodhead, speaking at a two-day conference at Duke Law School on the practice and ethics of trying cases in the media, apologized for "causing the families to feel abandoned when they most needed support." A Duke University spokesperson responded that "e have now seen the lawsuit and as we said before, if these plaintiffs have a complaint, it is with Mr. Nifong. Their legal strategy – attacking Duke – is misdirected and without merit. To help these families move on, Duke offered to cover the cost of any attorneys' fees or other out-of-pocket expenses, but they rejected this offer. We will vigorously defend the university against these claims."
