In 2000 and again in 2004, Time magazine named George W. Bush as its Person of the Year, a title awarded to someone who the editors believe "has done the most to influence the events of the year". In May 2004, Gallup reported that 89 percent of the Republican electorate approved of Bush. However, the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans' frustration with him on issues of spending, illegal immigration, and Middle Eastern affairs.  America's top diplomat is trying to revive dormant peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians, a source told CNN on Thursday. Secretary of State John Kerry presented Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas a formula designed to entice him to the negotiating table, a source familiar with Kerry's talks said. He also presented the ideas to an Arab League committee. This would serve the purpose of giving Abbas cover and encouraging him to accept. The Israeli–Palestinian conflict, ongoing since the middle of the 20th century, continued under Bush. After President Clinton's 2000 Camp David Summit had ended without an agreement, the Second Intifada had begun in September 2000. While previous administrations had tried to act as a neutral authority between the Israelis and Palestinians, the Bush administration placed the blame for the violence on the Palestinians, angering Arab states such as Saudi Arabia. However, Bush's support for a two-state solution helped smooth over a potential diplomatic split with the Saudis.
