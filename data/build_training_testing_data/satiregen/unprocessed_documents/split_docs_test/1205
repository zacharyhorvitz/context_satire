Takashi Miyazawa (宮澤崇史, Miyazawa Takashi) (born 27 February 1978, in Nagano City) is a Japanese former professional racing cyclist, who competed as a professional between 2003 and 2014. Miyazawa had a varied early career, riding cyclocross at first, then participating on various teams in Japan, Italy, and France, and even riding independently at times. He once quit road cycling to participate in the keirin school. Finally settling on road cycling with Bridgestone Anchor in 2005, Miyazawa quickly established himself as one of Japan's top sprinters, reaching the podium not only in Japan, but in Asia and Europe as well. The following year, he attended the University of East Anglia (UEA), concentrating in Film Studies and English Literature. He tried acting once more at the UEA but was not, at this point, particularly interested in it. Davenport had considered becoming a member of a film crew, as opposed to acting in front of the camera. His mother advised him, after his graduation from UEA, to write to John Cleese requesting work on the set of his upcoming film, Fierce Creatures, so that Davenport could gain some experience behind the camera. Tsukino Miyazawa (宮沢 月野, Miyazawa Tsukino) is the middle daughter of the Miyazawa family who tends to tease Kano, the youngest daughter. Neither Tsukino nor Kano understands Yukino's quest for perfection. But they love her very much and are constantly begging her to play with them. At the end of the series, Tsukino is shown to have become a talented tennis player.
