 The first debate of the 2020 Democratic nomination fight is in the books! With 10 candidates onstage, their answers limited to 60 seconds and most of the candidates unwilling to engage one another, the debate was less a debate than a series of one-minute speeches. I watched the whole thing and picked out some of the best -- and the worst -- from the night that was. (And I'll be doing the same in Thursday's debate!)  Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the top-polling Democratic presidential candidate onstage Wednesday night, and the early moments of the party's first 2020 debate showed why. Warren was asked four other questions before most of the nine other contenders had been asked two. Her platform set the pace for the night, with other candidates embracing elements of it -- or at least passing on opportunities to break directly with her. Meanwhile, two of the most aggressive candidates onstage, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli√°n Castro, chose another target to mercilessly attack: former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas.  The first Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday will have all eyes on Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who -- because of a random draw -- will be the only candidate polling in the top five on the stage. The debates, which will be held over two nights with 10 candidates appearing on each night, represent the best chance for each candidate on stage to score a break-out moment in front of a national audience. The stakes are particularly high for the lesser-known candidates, who are at risk of having their time in the national spotlight limited to this summer because the Democratic National Committee has raised the threshold to qualify for the third and fourth Democratic debates in September and October. Warren comes into the debate with significant momentum, boosted by a series of strong poll results that have put her neck-and-neck with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and trailing only former Vice President Joe Biden.
