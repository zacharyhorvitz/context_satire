In an emergency attempt to salvage the chapter, a team of national representatives came to the university in November 2006 to conduct a membership review, interviewing women individually about their dedication to the sorority. (Delta Zeta representatives have repeatedly asserted that they undertook the review on the advice of the university, whereas DePauw officials "vehemently" deny this.) A few days after the interview process, the national team with women from ΔΖ's Epsilon Chapter at nearby Indiana University held a recruiting event in the house, where some allege 25 of the chapter members were asked not to participate and to remain out of sight. A February 25, 2007 article in The New York Times quoted one former Delta Chapter member as saying, "They had these unassuming freshman girls downstairs with these plastic women from Indiana University, and 25 of my sisters hiding upstairs. On March 29, 2007, it was reported in The New York Times that Delta Zeta's national office, based in Oxford, Ohio, had filed suit in U.S. Federal District Court in Indianapolis against DePauw University for expelling the sorority from campus. The university said the lawsuit completely lacks merit. "From the beginning, DePauw University has acted to protect its students." In November, 2007, Delta Zeta withdrew the lawsuit and DePauw agreed that the sorority will have the opportunity to compete with other sororities attempting to colonize a chapter on the campus beginning in academic year 2010/11 however Delta Zeta elected not to compete for the 2010/2011 academic year and as of May 2010 has no future plans to do so. Since the reorganization and before the national publicity, 8 of 11 freshman women who received invitations to join Delta Zeta during formal recruitment chose not to become members. One said, "We all got together and talked about it and tried to have an open mind. But all of us were really against what they did, and we didn't want to be associated with it."
