It was announced that Jessica Simpson and then-husband Nick Lachey would star in their own MTV reality series, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica. The series, which chronicled Jessica and Nick's life as a married couple, became a pop culture phenomenon and helped draw attention to the Simpson sisters. Following the success of the series, it was confirmed that Ashlee would receive a spin-off series, The Ashlee Simpson Show. Hoping to end comparisons between her and her sister, Ashlee wanted the series to focus on the recording of her debut album. With the release of Sweet Kisses (1999), Simpson and her team marketed Simpson as "anti-sex appeal", as a contrast to artists such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera who had recently achieved success with their respective debut albums. The music found on her debut album mostly spoke on topics such as love, and Simpson announced that she would remain abstinent until marriage. Though the album sold four million copies worldwide, it failed to meet the expectations of Columbia Records; as a result, the label hoped to see Jessica mature her image for the release of her second album. She moved into the teen-pop genre, as she felt that restyling herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career. She separated from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible.
