On one account, he brought his doctor to the newly merged SCDP-CGC office to give everyone a shot of "super vitamins" to help with their working over the weekend for Chevy. Instead of making everyone productive, the booster shot only made Cutler and Stan Rizzo hyperactive, and causes Don to fade in and out of consciousness. He also brought Frank Gleason's daughter Wendy to the office that weekend, shortly after her father's funeral, and later peeked on Stan and Wendy having sex. In "Man with a Plan",  Bob tactfully assists Joan when she is in pain due to an ovarian cyst and, displaying an ability to think quickly and a willingness to lie, tells the nurse that Joan has just ingested poison, resulting in Joan's receiving treatment immediately after her abdominal pain alone had failed to result in any treatment. A grateful Joan prevents his lay-off after SCDP merges with CGC, and Bob is later seen accompanying Joan and Kevin to the beach. Meredith (Stephanie Drake) is a secretary who first appears as SCDP's receptionist during Season 5. Her infantile mannerisms and scatterbrained demeanor annoy Joan, and the two eventually have an altercation in the Season 5 episode "The Christmas Waltz", after Meredith allows a process server into the office to serve Joan with divorce papers. She remains at SCDP, however, and briefly becomes Lou Avery's secretary after he complains about Dawn's continued loyalty to Don who was on involuntary leave from the agency. She becomes Don's secretary when he returns, and then when Don vanishes, she becomes one of two secretaries for Roger and moves with him to McCann-Erickson.
