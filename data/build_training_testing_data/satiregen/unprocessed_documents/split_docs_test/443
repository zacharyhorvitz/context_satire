In the second season, he is blackmailed into becoming a zombie hunter for Max Rager, as the company attempts to cover up both their own responsibility for the outbreak, and the existence of zombies themselves. While he is named the "Chaos Killer" by the press, Major secretly defies MR orders, and freezes his targets toward their potential future cure. He eventually reverts to zombie form at the end of the second season, learning that his cure had only been temporary. In March 1971, the first two cereals in the line were introduced, the chocolate-flavored Count Chocula and the strawberry-flavored Franken Berry. In the commercials, the two monsters, Count Alfred Chocula and Franken Berry, would engage in comic bickering over which cereal was better, when something or someone else interfered in their verbal sparring and scared them out of their wits. After this status quo carries into the third season, it is revealed the amnesia was only temporary and that the character feigned memory loss in an attempt to change his life and how people viewed him, in the process finding a fresh start and happiness with Peyton. Shot by one of his father's henchmen, Blaine has a client turn him back into a zombie, and then kidnaps Angus and takes over his business. Despite their relationship returning to it is antagonistic roots, Blaine later helps Liv and Clive in an investigation. With the existence of zombies made public knowledge in the third-season finale, Blaine found himself a somewhat legitimate businessman.
