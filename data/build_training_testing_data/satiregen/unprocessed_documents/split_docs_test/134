 Rep. Joe Kennedy said he hopes for the sake of the country and the integrity of the US election process that special counsel Robert Mueller turns up nothing in his Russia investigation. "It is probably too much to hope that what Mueller's report is actually going to say is, 'Nothing to see here, nobody did anything wrong, we got everyone already and case closed.' That's what I hope it says," the Massachusetts Democrat told Van Jones on "The Van Jones Show," airing Saturday on CNN at 7 p.m. ET.  Thanks to CNN reporting, we now know that Attorney General Bill Barr is readying to receive special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election -- and the possibility of collusion with Donald Trump's campaign -- as soon as next week. Which is BIG news! For the better part of the last 20 months, we've received drips and drabs of what Mueller knows but have never had a chance to see the whole picture (or anything close to it). There have been nearly 200 criminal counts against 39 people and entities, seven people have pleaded guilty and another four have been sentenced to jail.  At the very end of a decidedly contentious interview between CNN's Chris Cuomo and White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway on Tuesday night, Conway said something regarding special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election that should raise every eyebrow you have (which should only be two). Here's the exchange -- it's long but important (bolding is mine): CUOMO:  -- when that probe comes out, Kellyanne, I'll give you guys as much time as you want to discuss its findings. I believe it's critical to the American people. The offer will always stand.
