The following is the guest list for the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, which took place on 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The marriage vows were those published in Common Worship, and included the promise to "to love and to cherish" each other. This was sealed by the exchange of rings. The wedding rings were created by Cleave and Company, with Markle's ring being fashioned out of Welsh gold and the Prince's ring made of platinum. After the signing of the registers, Harry and Markle together with the guests sang the national anthem. In March 2011, William and Catherine set up a gift fund held by The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry to allow well-wishers wanting to give them a wedding gift to donate money to charities they care about instead. The gift fund supported 26 charities of the coupleâ€™s choice, incorporating the armed forces, children, the elderly, art, sport and conservation. These causes are close to their hearts and reflect the experiences, passions and values of their lives so far.
