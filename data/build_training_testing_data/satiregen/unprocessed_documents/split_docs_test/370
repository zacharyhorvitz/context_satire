Presidents use Oval Office addresses as a way to directly communicate with the American people. It is considered to be a major address and it functions as a way to move public opinion by having a direct connection with the President of the United States. Presidential historian, Robert Dallek stated, “The Oval Office invokes the center of the presidential authority. That's the president's office, that's where he supposedly makes decisions, where he governs.” The tone of the speech is set when Presidents decide to make a speech in the Oval Office. Meanwhile, while not officially confirming interest in the vice presidential slot, Clinton hinted at the possibility earlier on June 3. When asked for clarification, her campaign released the statement "Today on a conference call with New York legislators, Sen. Clinton was asked whether she was open to the idea of running as vice president and repeated what she has said before: She would do whatever she could to ensure that Democrats take the White House back and defeat John McCain." The vice presidential possibility had been raised by Bill Clinton in the previous month, but this fueled speculation that Hillary Clinton was definitively interested in the possibility.  The lead up to Hillary Clinton's speech to a Democratic women's group in Washington on Tuesday night was focused on two things: The controversy around her exclusive use of personal emails at the State Department and questions around her family foundation's fundraising practices. Her speech, however, was not. Clinton failed to mention any aspect of the two stories that dominated all coverage of Clinton over the past week, instead using her speech to 1,600 mostly women Democratic activists to focus on her vision of the future, the importance of electing women to office and her all-but-announced presidential plans.
