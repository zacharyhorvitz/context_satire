In 2006, Church & Dwight expanded its household brand portfolio with the acquisition of Orange Glo International, which included such brands as OxiClean, a premium-priced leader in the fast-growing laundry pre-wash additive category, Kaboom bathroom cleaners, and Orange Glo household cleaning products. The acquisition provided not only new product categories, but also a different way for Church & Dwight brands to market themselves. Church & Dwight was ranked 723 in the Fortune 500 listing of companies in 2010. When it was introduced by Orange Glo International, it was marketed through infomercials with Billy Mays in the US and Canada as a "miracle cleanser." Church & Dwight acquired the OxiClean brand through its acquisition of Orange Glo International in 2006; at that point the OxiClean brand expanded into laundry detergent with the introduction of the OxiClean Detergent Ball, followed by OxiClean Liquid Laundry Detergent in 2014. It continued to be endorsed by Mays until his death in 2009; the product is now seen endorsed by Mays' friend and co-worker Anthony Sullivan. Mays and Sullivan were featured on the show Pitchmen on the Discovery Channel in which the product was featured on several occasions. In 1970, the Arm & Hammer brand introduced the marketâ€™s first nationally-distributed, phosphate-free detergent: Arm & Hammer Powder Laundry Detergent. Recent findings had shown the harmful effects phosphates could have on the health of lakes, streams and other freshwater bodies. The brand rushed to provide a solution and, in less than a year, was able to bring the product from concept to market. That same year in April, Arm & Hammer was honored to be the sole corporate sponsor of the first annual Earth Day.
