Carroll tells Barrett that the good news is that the time of the hit and run actually clears him of the murder. Barrett recognizes he has been double-framed but understands that, while Ferranti is alive, a charge related to this would be easier to get out of. Jessica comes into the station to tell her story, rife with details which seem to cement Barrett's guilt; he is held for grand theft auto and told that, should  Ferranti die, he will be charged with manslaughter. Jessica is taken aback by this, but she does not admit her involvement. Barrett locates an address for McNab. When he calls to share this with Jessica, she insists she accompany him there to be of help. Mrs. McNab tells them her husband is out of town, or "on a drunk". Jessica surreptitiously slips the woman $1,000 and a note telling her to say nothing to Barrett. After the woman goes, Jessica tells Barrett she loves him. After a few moments, she admits what Barrett knows, that she is responsible for the hit and run. She asks him to stay with her, and they share a romantic interlude; however, when she refuses to go to the police with the truth, he says he will give her until noon the next day to turn herself in, and leaves. Nina Ferranti comes to Barrett's apartment to apologize; she offers to help him.
