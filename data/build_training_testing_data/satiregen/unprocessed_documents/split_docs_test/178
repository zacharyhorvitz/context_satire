 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said Tuesday that he understands the criticism he has received for comments he made in 2011 about the challenges facing minority communities in education. During a 2011 public television broadcast while he was a candidate for mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Buttigieg said children "need to see evidence that education is going to work for them ... and there are a lot of kids, especially in the lower income, minority neighborhoods, who literally just haven't seen it work. There isn't somebody they know personally who testifies the value of education." Those comments, which resurfaced on social media this week, drew sharp criticism online, including in an essay by Michael Harriot titled "Pete Buttigieg is a lying MF" published on the African American-oriented website The Root.  New York Rep. Kathleen Rice is backing Pete Buttigieg for president, she told CNN, giving the South Bend, Indiana, mayor his third congressional endorsement. The endorsement, Buttigieg's second in the past two days, comes as the Democratic presidential candidate has surged to the top of the field in Iowa and has seen his poll numbers rise in New Hampshire. Despite his improved standing in the race, Buttigieg still lags behind his top competitors in congressional endorsements. Rice said in an interview on Monday that she is backing Buttigieg for the Democratic nomination because he is the "only candidate whose message is focused on addressing both our long term and short-term challenges that we face." The Republican Party had not been successful in South Bend mayoral elections in decades. Haas did not entirely embrace the identity of the party he was nominated by, declaring that he was more of a "centrist" than a Republican. He openely admitted to not having voted in party primaries in years, and also had admitted that he voted for Democrat Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. He also stated  that in the 2016 presidential election he "probably" voted for a third party candidate, but was not able to recall.
