The university has buildings scattered throughout the cities of Winterthur and Zurich, as well as campus-like facilities in WÃ¤denswil. Despite the fact that the schools and institutes are not all centrally located, students are rarely (if ever) required to relocate to other venues. 8 libraries are available for use by members of the university, as are the six on-location canteens. The Collegium Helveticum is an Institute for Advanced Study. It is jointly supported and operated by the ETH Zurich, the University of Zurich and the Zurich University of the Arts. It is dedicated to transdisciplinary research and acts as a think tank as well. Fellows are elected for five years to work together on a particular subject. ETH is a federal institute (i.e., under direct administration by the Swiss government), whereas the University of Zurich is a cantonal institution. The decision for a new federal university was heavily disputed at the time; the liberals pressed for a "federal university", while the conservative forces wanted all universities to remain under cantonal control, worried that the liberals would gain more political power than they already had. In the beginning, both universities were co-located in the buildings of the University of Zurich.
