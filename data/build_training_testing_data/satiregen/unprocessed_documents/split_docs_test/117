Green's first decision, given the delicate nature of the subject matter, was that the story had to be over-the-top and would have to "make a clown out of Hitler" to ensure no one would deem it offensive. His second decision was casting Joel Moore in that role. "If Joel Moore is Hitler," Green said, "there is absolutely no way you can take this seriously for a second." In February 2011, Allie goes to live in Hong Kong with her father Lucas for a while, after the man who is masquerading as her step-father Rafe Hernandez is mean to her several times. She returns after it is revealed that the man is an imposter. Sami and the real Rafe try to help Allie understand what has happened. In retirement, Devenney remains involved with his local club (having co-managed them to a Donegal Senior Football Championship in 2012), appears on media platforms such as Highland Radio and files a column for the Letterkenny Leader. He is also having to come to terms with Michael Murphy naming him on national television as his childhood hero. A shocked Devenney opened up on this revelation years later: "And that was back when Michael was already the fuckin' man! The fact that he has called me his hero is, probably, the most humbling thing that anyone has ever said to me".
