 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney had a win to savor and a wound to salve this week, after a crucial victory and a cringe-inducing gaffe. "Romney may have won New Hampshire but the premise of his candidacy began to unravel, " said an aide inside the re-election team backing President Barack Obama. The victory came in the New Hampshire primary election, the second contest in the long series of state-by-state votes to choose the candidate against Obama in November's presidential election. Romney also won in the state of Iowa a week earlier, making him the first Republican ever to take both opening rounds of voting.  It's round two in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, with voting beginning in New Hampshire. While most polling places in the state didn't open until early Tuesday, the first votes were cast just after midnight in the tiny communities of Dixville Notch and Hart's Location. In Dixville Notch, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor and ambassador to China, tied for the lead with two votes each.  With a narrow loss, Rick Santorum scored a stunning victory and now heads to New Hampshire, hoping this momentum sets him up as the anti-Mitt Romney in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Santorum, who lost to Romney by eight votes in the Iowa caucuses early Wednesday, is following a well-worn path on his march as the new political battleground shifts from this Midwestern state to New Hampshire. It is an uphill battle for Santorum, who faces a better-funded rival in Romney and questions about his own viability as a general election candidate. Meanwhile, one-time leading contender Newt Gingrich is hoping to breathe new life into his campaign with a sharper message in a new state.
