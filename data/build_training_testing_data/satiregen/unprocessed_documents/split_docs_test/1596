On Saturday, November 24, 2018, Hodge made a surprise appearance on the pregame portion Hockey Night in Canada. Notably, it was Hodge's first appearance on HNIC since the "pen flip" incident more than 31 years before. He was invited to appear at the suggestion of present HNIC host Ron MacLean. MacLean, who had replaced Hodge in 1987, interviewed him for about six minutes. On March 14, 1987, Hodge was the in-studio host as the CBC carried a game between the Calgary Flames and Toronto Maple Leafs. The game ended early and the network switched over to a regional game between the Philadelphia Flyers and Montreal Canadiens for the end of the third period. The game was tied 3-3 when the third period ended just before 11 PM Eastern time, meaning overtime would be required. CBC executives decided to cut away after 11:00 and that only viewers in Quebec (who had also seen the game from the start) would get to continue watching. Though he was only three caps into his international career by the time Robson announced his squad, Hodge was given a place on the plane to Mexico, coming on as a substitute in the first two group games against Portugal and Morocco, which England lost and drew respectively.
