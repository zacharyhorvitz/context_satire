 North Korea is touting a "great leap forward" in its rocket program after the successful testing of a new high-thrust engine, state media reported Sunday. The test measured the thrust power in the combustion chamber, the structural safety and reliability of the engine, and the movement of the turbine pump, the Korean Central News Agency said. It reportedly took place at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground, in North Pyongan Province. CNN military analyst Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling said advances in North Korea's rocket system could help with the country's development of ICBMs -- intercontinental ballistic missiles.  China urged the United States to take a "cool-headed" approach to escalating tensions with North Korea, calling for a diplomatic solution to North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in the Chinese capital Saturday after issuing the administration's bluntest warning yet to North Korea, saying that no option -- including military action -- is off the table. For two hours, Tillerson met with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, who said the United States should "come back to the right track of a negotiated settlement." Tillerson said that North Korean tensions had reached a "dangerous level" and said China had agreed to work together to make Pyongyang "change course," though he didn't give further details.  A North Korean missile fired Wednesday exploded "within seconds of launch," according to US Pacific Command. US officials confirmed North Korea had attempted to launch a missile near Kalma, on the country's east coast, but early reports suggest it failed. "South Korea and the US are aware of the missile launch and to their knowledge North Korea's missile was not successfully launched," South Korea's Ministry of Defense said in a statement. Neither the US nor South Korea have released information on what type of missile was fired, or why it failed.
