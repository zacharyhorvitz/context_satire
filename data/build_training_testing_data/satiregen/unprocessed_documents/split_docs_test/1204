The low point of the season came three weeks later in a loss to the Falcons which was the Saints' tenth in eleven weeks. Ditka came into the postgame press conference appearing emotionally exhausted and said he felt the Saints would be better off hiring someone else to coach the team. Ditka claimed he "didn't have it anymore", and said to the reporters that "God puts people in places for reasons, and he probably put me here to be humbled. I deserve it." Though Berman was eventually surprised by the dynamic between the two, she commented on her initial hesitations about working with the couple, saying, "I believe it was the wrong decision to let a 16-year-old marry a man in his 50s. It's uncomfortable to see... I said to my producer, 'I think this guy is a pedophile...I don't know if I can work with these people.' I don't condone it, but I do see that this is a married couple that is genuinely married and they have marital issues that needed to be worked on. The 1999 season proved to be the worst of Ditka's coaching career. After winning the season opener the Saints dropped their next seven games, including a loss to the expansion Cleveland Browns. As the season wore on Ditka's frustrations began showing in the local media. After a late season practice with the team sitting at 2â€“7, Ditka was very abrupt and dismissive of reporters whom he felt were asking him stupid questions and was asked by one of them why he was in such a bad mood.
