The Mummy was released on June 9, 2017, to predominantly negative reviews from critics, as well as an underwhelming performance at the box office. By November, The Bride of Frankenstein was pulled from its initial release, and lead producers/co-architects of the Dark Universe, Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan, left Universal and departed from the franchise. Universal has put a hold on future projects while they create a plan for future releases. Universal Pictures released an official statement reading: Universal Studios was founded by Carl Laemmle, Mark Dintenfass, Charles O. Baumann, Adam Kessel, Pat Powers, William Swanson, David Horsley, Robert H. Cochrane and Jules Brulatour. One story has Laemmle watching a box office for hours, counting patrons and calculating the day's takings. Within weeks of his Chicago trip, Laemmle gave up dry goods to buy the first several nickelodeons. For Laemmle and other such entrepreneurs, the creation in 1908 of the Edison-backed Motion Picture Trust meant that exhibitors were expected to pay fees for Trust-produced films they showed. Derek returns to Beacon Hills in the last two episodes of season 6 to help fight the hunters. In the final flashforward, two years later, he is shown to still be allied with Scott's pack. The Anukite takes the form of Jennifer Blake to force Derek to open his eyes, suggesting his greatest fear was having to relive allowing the woman he loved be killed.
