 Washington political consultant W. Samuel Patten, who helped steer foreign money to President Donald Trump's inauguration, was sentenced to probation without jail time in another criminal case that grew out of Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian and Ukrainian influence in American politics and the 2016 presidential election. Specifically, he will serve three years probation, pay a $5,000 fine and do 500 hours of "hands on" community service, the judge said. Patten, 47, who pleaded guilty last August, has contributed to additional, still unknown investigations, highlighting the constellation of cases to grow out of Mueller's work and how some aspects of the Russia probe continue. As part of his plea deal, Patten admitted to seeking tickets to Trump's inauguration on behalf of a Ukrainian oligarch, according to court documents, and ultimately paid $50,000 for four tickets.  Lobbyist Sam Patten provided "substantial assistance" to special counsel Robert Mueller and several other ongoing investigations, federal prosecutors said Monday, paving the way for him to potentially avoid jail time at his sentencing this week. The case has been full of intrigue from the beginning, given Patten's connections to several prongs of Mueller's investigation. He founded a company with a suspected Russian operative, steered foreign money to President Donald Trump's inauguration, was closely tied to Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, and advised the controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica. Prosecutors from the US attorney's office in Washington didn't recommend a sentence for Patten, who first came under investigation by Mueller's team.  Robert Mueller's team declined to prosecute Donald Trump Jr. and other members of the campaign for campaign finance violations for their participation in the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, in part, because they couldn't prove that they "willfully" violated the law. "Taking into account the high burden to establish a culpable mental state in a campaign-finance prosecution and the difficulty in establishing the required valuation, the Office decided not to pursue criminal campaign-finance charges against Trump Jr. or other campaign officials for the events culminating in the June 9 meeting," Mueller's team explained. "The Office ultimately concluded that, even if the principal legal questions were resolved favorably to the government, a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that Campaign officials or individuals connected to the Campaign willfully violated the law," the team continues. On June 9, 2016, Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower.
