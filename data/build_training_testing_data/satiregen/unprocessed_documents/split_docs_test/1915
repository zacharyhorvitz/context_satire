 Hillary Clinton believes, finally, that the force is with her. The former secretary of state's tactics and performance in Saturday's Democratic debate suggested that she thinks that though her campaign struggled out of the gate following a series of personal missteps, the nomination may be finally within her grasp as voting in first-in-the-nation states looms. Sometimes, the fights politicians chose to skip reveal as much about them as the ones they decide to wage. And Clinton sent a clear signal in New Hampshire about where her real targets lie in the 2016 presidential race.  After holding former President Bill Clinton behind-the-scenes and on the fundraising trail of her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton announced Saturday night at a post-debate meet-and-greet that her husband will be hitting the campaign trail in January. "Starting in January, I will have my not so secret weapon here," Hillary Clinton said, referring to Bill Clinton, who stood on stage with her. "We are going to cover as much ground in New Hampshire as we possibly can, see as many people, thank everybody who is going to turn out and vote for me and try to get some more to join me." Multiple Clinton aides confirmed to CNN that the former president will start headlining events for the campaign in January, including solo events without his presidential candidate wife.  Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign raised more than $1 million on Friday, in part off an email charging that the Democratic National Committee tilted the scales toward Hillary Clinton after the DNC cut off Sanders from a crucial voter database, a campaign aide said Saturday. "The reality is that the huge turnouts that we've had at our meetings, our strong fundraising, our volunteer base, and quick rise in the polls have caused the Democratic National Committee to place its thumb on the scales in support of Hillary Clinton's campaign," read the email. "You see that fact evidenced in their decision to bury the Democratic debates on weekends during nationally televised football games. It's more or less an open secret."
