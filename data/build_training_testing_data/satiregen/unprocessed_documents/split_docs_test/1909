 When Vice President Mike Pence woke up Tuesday in the west of Ireland, he had a long commute ahead of him: the span of the entire island to Dublin, where he was meeting with government officials. The reason for the journey: Pence was staying at the golf property owned by his boss, President Donald Trump, in Doonbeg. That's 181 miles — or an hour's drive plus a 40-minute flight — away from the government buildings where Pence will conduct his official visit on Tuesday. Pence also happens to have family connections to the tiny Irish village, surrounded by windswept Atlantic coastline and bogland.  Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, brushed off concerns about government spending at President Donald Trump's businesses on Tuesday, saying Trump's hotels are "just like any other hotel." His comments come as House Democrats move to expand their impeachment investigation to focus on Trump's business dealings and questions of corruption. "The President's resorts are hotels that he owns. People are traveling, it's just like any other hotel," McCarthy said at a Capitol Hill news conference Tuesday morning.  House Democrats are demanding documents on President Donald Trump's promotion of his Miami resort for next year's G7 summit and Vice President Mike Pence's recent stay at Trump's Ireland golf property that was hours away from where he conducted official business. The House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committees this week sent a series of letters requesting documents and other information from the White House, the Vice President's office, the US Secret Service and the Trump Organization about the two matters. "The Committee does not believe that U.S. taxpayer funds should be used to personally enrich President Trump, his family, and his companies," wrote Oversight chairman, Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland. The requests are part of the Judiciary committee's decision to broaden its probe into the President as the committee decides whether to bring articles of impeachment against Trump.
