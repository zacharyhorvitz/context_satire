One of the restaurant's promotions is a reward for customers who finish a Triple or Quadruple Bypass Burger, after which they are placed on a wheelchair and wheeled out to their vehicle by their "personal nurse". In 2011, Chipotle created the "Farm Team", which is a rewards program available only by invitation from restaurant managers. The Farm Team members have access to a special Chipotle website, where members can earn rewards, i.e. free food and T-shirts. The site offers members to, "learn where Chipotleâ€™s food comes from, take quizzes and polls, play games and watch videos about the company".  Many Americans are wondering: Why go out for a burger when you can grill one at home for way cheaper? Wendy's warned on Wednesday that the recent alarming slowdown in restaurant sales is being driven by a growing gap between the rising cost of eating out and falling prices at the grocery store. "It's gotten a lot cheaper...to get fresh beef at your local butcher and go home and grill it," Wendy's executives said during a conference call with analysts. Higher prices at restaurants is a side effect of higher minimum wages that have gone into effect in many states and also a healthier jobs market that has forced employers to pay their workers more.
