 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday defended his fellow 2020 hopeful Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii against the claim that she is a "Russian asset," saying the suggestion is "outrageous." "Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country," the Vermont independent tweeted. "People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset." Sanders does not name Hillary Clinton in the tweet, but his comments appear to be aimed at the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, whose claim last week on a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe that the Russians are "grooming" a Democrat in the 2020 presidential primary to run as a third-party candidate and champion their interests has caused a backlash.  It's hard for anything to come truly out of left field in a political world in which Donald Trump is the President of the United States. And yet, when Hillary Clinton attacked Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard late last week (although not by name), it shocked me. Here's what Clinton said in a podcast interview with Democratic strategist David Plouffe: "I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's the favorite of the Russians."  The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations committee said Thursday that a rancorous White House meeting on Syria -- during which top Democrats walked out after President Donald Trump began insulting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- was "belligerent from the get-go." "The meeting started off with the President walking in and slamming down his files on the table, suggesting that this was a meeting he agreed to, but that we had asked for. No one had asked for the meeting. I got an invitation from the White House.
