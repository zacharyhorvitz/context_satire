 Obama administration officials, in their strongest language yet, warned Wednesday of dangerous interruptions to terrorist tracking as top Senate Republicans raced to find a compromise that would prevent the shutdown of major U.S. intelligence programs on Sunday. Even if lawmakers reach an agreement, the program will lapse until legislation is approved by both the House and the Senate next week -- something administration officials said could pose a grave threat to Americans' safety. A gap in the programs amounts to playing "national security Russian roulette," according to one official. Unless reauthorized by Congress, the National Security Agency will have to shutter, at least temporarily, its bulk phone data collection program, which provides the intelligence community clues as to who potential terrorists are calling. As of May 7, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the interpretation of Section 215 of the Patriot Act was wrong and that the NSA program that has been collecting Americans' phone records in bulk is illegal. It stated that Section 215 cannot be clearly interpreted to allow government to collect national phone data and, as a result, expired on June 1, 2015. This ruling "is the first time a higher-level court in the regular judicial system has reviewed the N.S.A. phone records program."  The U.S. government on Monday found itself with fewer tools to investigate terrorism -- at least temporarily -- after the Senate let provisions of the Patriot Act expire Sunday night. While officials warned of national security risks, it is clear that the lapse will not come close to debilitating counterterrorism efforts. The Senate entered a debate period late Sunday on the Patriot Act that pushed beyond the midnight deadline, effectively ending three provisions of that law, including the National Security Agency's bulk data collection program. The lapse was a huge victory for privacy hawks who have called for changes to that program and others under the Patriot Act since Edward Snowden first blew the lid off the NSA's domestic surveillance programs in 2013.
