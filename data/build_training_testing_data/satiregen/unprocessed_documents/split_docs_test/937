 Mike Pence might not have helped Donald Trump in Tuesday night's vice presidential debate -- but he certainly helped his own political future. The Indiana governor largely batted away Hillary Clinton running mate Tim Kaine's recitations of Trump's most incendiary comments, dismissing Kaine's pressure as "pre-done lines" from an "insult-driven campaign." He sidestepped Trump's most politically toxic remarks -- on Muslims, Mexicans, a disabled journalist and more -- and showed how a more conventional Republican could attack Clinton. It had some Republicans crowing about Pence's chances in 2020 -- and others saying they wish he could be promoted to the top of the ticket in 2016.  Donald Trump and Mike Pence are a study in contrasts when it comes to their debate preparation. As the vice presidential candidates prepare to take the stage for a televised debate this Tuesday, a campaign official said GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence has been preparing for Tuesday's debate since the day the Indiana governor received the call to join the Republican ticket in July. Pence's debate preparations contrast sharply with the much looser sessions used by Trump in the weeks running up to his first face-off with Hillary Clinton. Trump never practiced against a stand-in for Clinton.  "Some calm, something peaceful." That is what Rob Chapman is hoping will come out of the vice presidential debate being held in his hometown of Farmville, Virginia. "I think they have a better disposition, they should be able to get along," Chapman, the 45-year-old manager of Walker's Diner on North Main Street, says of vice presidential nominees Mike Pence and Tim Kaine. After the fireworks Americans saw in the general election's first presidential debate, many expect the vice presidential debate to be a more sober affair -- free of name calling, shimmies, or, hopefully, audio issues.
