 Creating more economic opportunities will be Mexico's greatest weapon in the war on drugs, the country's president-elect said Tuesday. "That, I think, is going to be the best way my government can prevent organized crime," President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Without jobs and social programs, he said, "millions of my countrymen have no other option than to dedicate themselves sometimes to criminal activity." The wide-ranging interview was recorded just a few hours before the incoming leader met with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington.  The crowd at the base of the Space Needle in Seattle began counting down as midnight approached. It wasn't New Year's Day they were anticipating, but the moment that marijuana would become legal in Washington state. As midnight hit, smokers hit their pipes and joints to celebrate. Technically, what they were doing -- smoking marijuana in public -- was still a crime, but police looked the other way.  A new law legalizing recreational marijuana use in Washington takes effect today. Adults 21 and over are allowed to possess up to one ounce of marijuana, and while many in the state are lighting up and celebrating the law today, not everyone is supporting it. Steve Sarich is the Executive Director of the Cannibis Action Coalition and runs a local dispensary for medical marijuana patients. Heâ€™s also the Manager of the "No on I-502" Committee, which was the most vocal opponent of the Washington law being passed.
