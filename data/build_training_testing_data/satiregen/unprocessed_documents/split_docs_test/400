There they established the museum and the Walter Russell Foundation, and in 1957 the Commonwealth of Virginia granted a charter for the University of Science and Philosophy, a correspondence school with a home study course (In 2014, the charter was grandfathered back to 1948). Walter and Lao Russell collaborated on a number of books. The testing of atomic bombs in the atmosphere prompted them to publish Atomic Suicide? in 1957 in which they warned of grave consequences for the planet and for humankind if radioactivity was exploited as a world fuel. Walter B. Russell Jr. (July 24, 1929 â€“ May 17, 2016) was an American soldier, state legislator, county commissioner, and lawyer. He served in Korea and Vietnam. After being retired from the U.S. Army because of a wound to his head, Russell graduated from law school, was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives and later to the chair of the Dekalb County commissioners. He practiced law after leaving public office. Russell's life was changed by a phone call from Daisy (Cook) Stebbing in 1946. Daisy was an immigrant from England, a former model and businesswoman, who was living in Boston. She had read Glenn Clark's book, The Man Who Tapped the Secrets of the Universe. In 1948, Walter at age 77 divorced his first wife and married Daisy Stebbing age 44, amid some controversy.
