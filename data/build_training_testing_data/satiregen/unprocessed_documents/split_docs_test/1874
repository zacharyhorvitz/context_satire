 "Harriet" director Kasi Lemmons has said she pitched the movie as the "superhero origin story of Harriet Tubman." The result is a biography that stirringly conveys the Underground Railroad leader's heroism, but which also Hollywood-izes her story in occasionally distracting ways. Cynthia Erivo (perhaps best known for her starring role in "The Color Purple" on Broadway) plays Tubman, a slave on a Maryland plantation. Introduced in 1849, Araminta Ross, or "Minty" as she's known, has already seen her sisters sold away.  When music icon Prince passed away from an accidental overdose in 2016 he was in the midst of writing his intimate autobiography. Three years on and, with the help of Prince's chosen collaborator Dan Piepenbring, "The Beautiful Ones" has been completed and was released on Tuesday by Cornerstone. Detailing how he carefully curated material for the book, Piepenbring told The Guardian: "The sheer quantity of paper was surprising. "There was no real method to the madness.  Rock 'n roll might be a young person's game, but Bruce Springsteen shows no signs of slowing down as he hits his 70th birthday, and indeed has exhibited an appetite to expand his creative horizons. So he follows the Netflix special capturing his Broadway show with "Western Stars," a deeply personal film performing songs from his latest album, which also marks his debut as a director. Co-director, actually, since Springsteen shares those chores with longtime collaborator Thomas Zimny -- with whom he collaborated on "The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town" and "Springsteen on Broadway" -- in an 80-some-odd minute presentation that weds the music to Springsteen's stage-honed storytelling skills, coupled with gauzy images of him and his wife, Patti Scialfa. It is, clearly, a valentine for hardcore "Bruuuuuce" fans, but one that does an effective job of both showcasing the material and connecting the songs in a thematic way, supporting an album that Springsteen describes near the outset as a meditation on "the struggle between individual freedom and communal life."
