 The New York Times Magazine's new 1619 Project is a special edition that reframes American history around one date: August 1619, when the first slave ship arrived on America's shores. "The Fourth of July in 1776 is regarded by most Americans as the country's birthday," says an introduction on the Times' website. "But what if we were to tell you that the country's true birth date, the moment that its defining contradictions first came into the world, was in late August 1619?" The project, released online Wednesday and in print on Sunday, outlines its thesis: "No aspect of the country that would be formed here has been untouched by the years of slavery that followed." A professor of history and geography at the University of West Georgia in the 1970s, Gingrich won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1978, the first Republican in the history of Georgia's 6th congressional district to do so. He served as House Minority Whip from 1989 to 1995. A co-author and architect of the "Contract with America", Gingrich was a major leader in the Republican victory in the 1994 congressional election. In 1995, Time named him "Man of the Year" for "his role in ending the four-decades-long Democratic majority in the House". Newt Gingrich has declared his position on many political issues through his public comments and legislative record, including as Speaker of the House. The political initiative with which he is most widely identified was the Contract With America, which outlined an economic and social agenda designed to improve the efficiency of government while reducing its burden on the American taxpayer. Passage of the Contract helped establish Gingrich's reputation as a public intellectual. His engagement of public issues has continued through to the present, in particular as the founder of American Solutions for Winning the Future.
