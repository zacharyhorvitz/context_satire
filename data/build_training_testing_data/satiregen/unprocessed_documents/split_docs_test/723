Greenwich Hospital was a permanent home for retired sailors of the Royal Navy, which operated from 1692 to 1869. Its buildings were later used by the Royal Naval College, Greenwich and the University of Greenwich, and are now known as the Old Royal Naval College. The word "hospital" was used in its original sense of a place providing hospitality for those in need of it, and did not refer to medical care, although the buildings included an infirmary which, after Greenwich Hospital closed, operated as Dreadnought Seaman's Hospital until 1986. In February 2017, the South London Critical Care Network reviewed the hospital's intensive care department and found a complete lack of medical leadership. Care for patients across the trust could be affected because of issues with the critical care service. It was suggested that “younger fitter patients with single organ failure” would not be admitted to intensive care until they developed multiorgan failure because of pressures on bed availability. Only 3.5 full-time equivalent consultants were in post with staff working locum shifts to fill gaps. The charitable foundation of Greenwich Hospital still exists, although it is no longer based at the original site. It is now a Royal Charity for the benefit of seafarers and their dependants, with the Secretary of State for Defence acting as The Crown's sole trustee. The charity now funds sheltered housing for former Royal Navy personnel and the school it spawned, the Royal Hospital School, now at Holbrook in Suffolk. The charity's head office is located in the City of London.
