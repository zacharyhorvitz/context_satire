 A friend of slain Austin mother Heidi Broussard, who went missing in December and was later found dead, has been charged with capital murder and kidnapping. Magen Fieramusca, 34, was indicted Tuesday by a grand jury in Travis County, according to a news release from the Travis County District Attorney's office. The indictment alleges that Fieramusca kidnapped Broussard, 33, and her newborn daughter and asphyxiated Broussard. Broussard and Margot went missing on December 12 after Broussard dropped her son off at an elementary school.
