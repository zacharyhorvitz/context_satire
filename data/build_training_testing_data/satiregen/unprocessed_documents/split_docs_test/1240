According to the Lambda-CDM model, by this stage, the matter in the universe is around 84.5% cold dark matter and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. (However the total matter in the universe is only 31.7%, much smaller than the 68.3% of dark energy.) There is overwhelming evidence that dark matter exists and dominates our universe, but since the exact nature of dark matter is still not understood, the Big Bang theory does not presently cover any stages in its formation. At some time the Stelliferous Era will end as stars are no longer being born, and the expansion of the universe will mean that the observable universe becomes limited to local galaxies. There are various scenarios for the far future and ultimate fate of the universe. More exact knowledge of our current universe will allow these to be better understood.  Scientific understanding proceeds by fits and starts, with an occasional detour down a wrong path. However, today the world's physicists have a real advance to celebrate. They have observed the most massive known fundamental subatomic particle directly interacting with an energy field that gives mass to the building blocks of the universe. This has never been done before and it gives increased insight into a phenomenon that was only discovered just a few short years ago.
