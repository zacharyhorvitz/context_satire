 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg doesn't anticipate that fellow candidate and 2016 alum Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont will garner the necessary coalition of Democratic voters to win in 2020, in an interview with The New York Times. "People were refreshed by the novelty of that boldness" of Sanders' far-left policies in 2016, Buttigieg said in the interview, published on Wednesday. The South Bend, Indiana, mayor then cast doubt on the 77-year-old democratic socialist's ability to win the 2020 general election. "I have a hard time seeing the coalition ultimately coming together there," Buttigieg told the Times. The 2020 presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders, the junior United States Senator and former Congressman from Vermont, began with Sanders' formal announcement on February 19, 2019. The announcement followed widespread speculation that he would run again after finishing as the runner-up in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. In the 2016 presidential campaign, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders sought the Democratic Party's nomination in a field of six major candidates and was the runner up with 46% of the pledged delegates behind former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who won the contest with 54%. Sanders, the junior United States Senator and former Representative from Vermont, began with an informal announcement on April 30, 2015, and a formal announcement that he planned to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States on May 26, 2015, in Burlington, Vermont. Sanders had been considered a potential candidate for president since at least September 2014. Though he had previously run as an independent, he routinely caucused with the Democratic Party, as many of his views align with Democrats.
