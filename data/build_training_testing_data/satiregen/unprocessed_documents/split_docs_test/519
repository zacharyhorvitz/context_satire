 The Republican Study Committee and the "Tuesday group" of House GOP moderates both endorsed Paul Ryan for speaker of the House on Thursday, meaning the Wisconsin Republican has support from the three groups he said he needed to run for the position. Ryan said earlier this week he would only run for Speaker if he got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, the RSC and the Tuesday group. On Wednesday night more than two-thirds of the Freedom Caucus voted back to Ryan -- just short of an official endorsement, but Ryan said afterward he planned to move forward with his bid and continue talking to other House Republicans. He is expected to make an official announcement by Friday, but now has secured enough votes to be elected Speaker when the full House votes next Thursday.  House Speaker John Boehner scheduled an election for Republicans to pick his successor on October 28, according to several GOP lawmakers who attended a Wednesday morning party meeting. The decision to set an election date signals that Boehner is confident that Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan will agree to run for speaker. Ryan, currently the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, said Tuesday that he was open to running, but only if certain conditions were met. He's seeking the full support of the GOP conference, including important factions of conservatives.  Rep. Paul Ryan told House Republicans on Tuesday he is willing to serve as speaker and will make a decision within the week -- but only if his conditions are met. Ryan laid out his guidelines in a closed-door session with the full House GOP conference after weeks of lobbying from senior members of his party for him to take on the difficult task of leading the divided conference -- a job Ryan repeatedly said he has never wanted. "I came to the conclusion that this is a very dire moment -- not just for Congress, not just for the Republican Party, but for our country. And I think our country is in desperate need of leadership," Ryan told reporters after addressing his colleagues.
