 The impact of Hurricane Sandy on the lives of residents of the Northeast will be great. Millions are without power, likely for an extended period of time. Businesses -- from the nation's stock exchanges and all the way on down to thousands of corner stores -- have been shut down. The total cost of property damage and lost business is estimated to run between $10 billion to $20 billion, according to Eqecat, which provides loss estimates to the insurance industry.  No one hopes Hurricane Sandy lives up to its potential. The storm that has already claimed nearly two dozen lives in the Caribbean churned Friday near the northern Bahamas, and meteorologists warn that it packs the potential to slam the U.S. Northeast as soon as Monday with powerful winds and pelting rain. Worst case, Sandy could merge with a strong cold front from the west. The double threat could morph into a "superstorm" that could sit over New England for days, making untold trouble for millions of residents.  Gas prices are likely to spike in the days after Hurricane Sandy rips through the Northeast, but they should drop back down before too long. The largest Atlantic storm ever recorded is making its way through the heart of the East Coast's oil refinery region. Sandy's fierce winds and unrelenting rain will be pounding major refineries in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Many have already shut down temporarily.
