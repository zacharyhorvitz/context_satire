 Bill Clinton reflected in an interview released Friday on his 40-year marriage to Hillary Clinton and some of the "heartbreaks and disappointment" that have shaped her life. His comments came shortly after Donald Trump applauded himself for not bringing up the former president's infidelity at Monday's presidential debate. In an interview with Max Linsky on "With Her," the Clinton campaign's podcast, the former president opened up about how the Democratic nominee has changed since he met her over 40 years ago. "In Hemingway's immortal words: In some way or another, life breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places," Bill Clinton said.  Donald Trump threatened Saturday to bring Gennifer Flowers, with whom Bill Clinton admitted to having a sexual relationship decades ago, to Monday's presidential debate. The taunt is a response to prominent Trump critic Mark Cuban's plans to sit in the front row of the debate at the invitation of Hillary Clinton's campaign. It's the Republican nominee's latest public reference to the 42nd president's infidelity, which he has occasionally cited in his campaign to criticize his Democratic challenger. "If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Jennifer Flowers right alongside of him!"  Sen. Tim Kaine is taking a break from the campaign trail to prepare for next week's vice presidential debate. Hillary Clinton's running mate is heading to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he will prepare for the debate alongside a team of campaign aides and advisers through Saturday. He has no public events scheduled in the swing state. This comes after a several-day swing jam-packed with fundraisers, rallies, office visits, roundtables, and even an appearance at a pow wow.
