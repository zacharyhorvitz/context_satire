 Martin Shkreli once bragged that he would go to a "Club Fed" instead of a real jail. Now he is inmate #87850-053 at a Brooklyn federal jail, which is about as real as it gets. "It's a tough place," said Robert Kipnees, a white-collar criminal defense attorney at the New York firm Lowenstein Sandler. Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center is a federal jail with a population of nearly 2,000. The Metropolitan Detention Center, Guaynabo (MDC Guaynabo) is a United States federal prison facility in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico which holds male and female inmates of all security levels who are awaiting trial or sentencing. It is operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a division of the United States Department of Justice.  Federal prosecutors want a judge to revoke bail for Martin Shkreli after he offered money to anyone who could grab Hillary Clinton's hair. In a court filing on Thursday, the prosecutors called it part of "an escalating pattern of threats and harassment." Shkreli, a former pharmaceutical executive who gained national notoriety two years ago for jacking up the price of a drug used by AIDS patients, was convicted of securities fraud last month for mismanaging two investment funds. The prosecutors cited a Facebook post on Monday in which Shkreli promoted a conspiracy theory about the Clinton Foundation and offered the money for a lock of Clinton's hair.
