Scott Andrew Mink (October 13, 1963 – July 20, 2004) was executed by the State of Ohio. A drug addict and alcoholic, he had been sentenced to die on June 29, 2001, for beating his 79-year-old father and 72-year-old mother to death with a hammer. On March 5, while appearing as a guest co-host on The View, Yang announced he was creating a non-profit organization called Humanity Forward, dedicated to promoting the ideas he campaigned on during his run, such as UBI and data privacy. The non-profit will also seek to engage and activate new voters while supporting like-minded down-ballot candidates, following the model of the pro-Bernie Sanders 501(c)4 Our Revolution. Yang also announced that the organization would give away $500,000 in UBI to the residents of a (currently unspecified) town in New York to demonstrate the benefits of UBI. Mink was one of the last places in the United States to receive traditional landline telephone service. Service began in February 2005, when BellSouth spent $700,000, or about $47,000 per phone, to run a cable of 30 miles (48 km) through thick forests to the hamlet. The thrust to bring the telephone service to Mink began when a resident of the community, Alice Louise Johnson Bolton (1921-2014), a retired teacher's assistant, spoke out at a town hall meeting in Natchitoches in 2003 called by Foster Campbell, one of the five members of the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Mrs. Bolton renewed her long-term quest for telephone service by noting that Mink was repeatedly bypassed by the phone company.
