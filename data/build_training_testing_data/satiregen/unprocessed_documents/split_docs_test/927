 The American Automobile Association is suing the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey over toll increases that recently went into effect at New York City bridges. AAA of New York and North Jersey filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan Tuesday, alleging that toll hikes that began on September 18 breach a federal law that requires interstate tolls be set at "just and reasonable" rates, according to a statement released by the agency. "Clearly, drivers are already paying more than their fair share -- and they are doing so at a time when federal, state and local authorities are hard pressed to meet routine road and bridge maintenance needs," said Marta Genovese, AAA New York's vice president and counsel in a statement. The lawsuit seeks to stop the toll increases, which affect commuters using the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the George Washington, Bayonne and Goethals bridges, as well as the Outerbridge Crossing.  Lower Manhattan was abuzz with rumors that British rock band Radiohead would kick off an impromptu concert for an enthusiastic crowd Friday in New York's Zuccotti Park, where Wall Street protestors gathered for a second straight week. Despite comments from the band's spokesman that they would not play, hundreds congregated at the plaza after organizers from a group called Occupy Wall Street announced the British rockers would soon arrive. When they never did, most of the crowd quickly dispersed. The park has remained a rallying point for demonstrators who have camped out in protest over what they say are social inequities derived from greed and corruption plaguing the current financial system.  About 80 people were arrested on the eighth day of protests in New York on Saturday, the greatest number since demonstrations started near Wall Street. Earlier arrests in the week  totaled about 20 on previous days for similar charges, according to New York City Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne. The latest arrests include disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration and assaulting a police officer, according to Browne. The protests started September 17 in lower Manhattan  and are aimed at drawing attention to the role powerful financial interests played in America's spiraling economy.
