 This is week five of an ongoing series: A Catholic Reads the Bible. Read week one, week two, week three and week four. You better choose to follow God, or else. For the first time in this journey of reading the Bible, God scared me.  Last September, I made my first visit to North Korea, granted a rare glimpse of what goes on beyond the demilitarized zone, in one of the most mysterious places on Earth. Now, eight months on, the regime has invited me to return to the reclusive nation where foreign visitors -- especially journalists -- are seldom welcomed. Last time around I learned to get used to the government minders who stuck by our side, ensuring we only saw what the government wanted us to see. I know they'll be there again this time, waiting for us when we land in Pyongyang.  For the first time in two decades, Cisco will have a CEO not named John Chambers. Cisco on Monday announced that longtime executive Chuck Robbins will replace Chambers as the company's chief executive. Robbins will officially take the networking company's reins on July 26, and he was named as one of the company's directors. Though the move isn't exactly a shock -- rumors of Chambers stepping down have been ongoing for years -- it's hard to imagine the company being led by someone else.
