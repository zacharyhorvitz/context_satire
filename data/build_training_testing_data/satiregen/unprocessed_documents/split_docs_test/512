On September 5, 1847, Jesse James was born on the James farm, where his family resided to the northeast of the site on which Kearney would eventually be established. James formed the infamous James-Younger gang in 1866, which operated until the Younger brothers were captured in 1876. James formed a new gang in 1879 and continued until his death on April 3, 1882, when he was shot by fellow gang-member Robert Ford. He was buried on his farm, but now rests in Mt. In addition, Kearney Hall, located on the campus of Saint John Fisher College, is named for his mother. Kearney /ˈkɑːrni/ is a city in Clay County, Missouri, United States. The population per the 2010 U.S. Census was 8,381. The city was the birthplace of Jesse James, and there is an annual festival in the third weekend of September to recognize the outlaw.
