The Proto-Celtic language, also called Common Celtic, is the partially reconstructed ancestor language of all the known Celtic languages. Its lexis, or vocabulary, can be confidently reconstructed on the basis of the comparative method of historical linguistics, in the same manner as Proto-Indo-European or PIE, the ancient language which has been most thoroughly re-constructed. Proto-Celtic is a descendant of the Proto-Indo-European language and is itself the ancestor of the Celtic languages which are members of the modern Indo-European language family, the most commonly spoken language family. Modern Celtic languages share common features with Italic languages that are unseen in other branches and according to one theory they may have formed an ancient Italo-Celtic branch. Belfast Celtic Football Club was a football club in Ireland (now Northern Ireland)that was founded in 1891,  and was one of the most successful teams in Ireland until it withdrew permanently from the Irish League in 1949. It left the league for political reasons, as the team and its supporters were largely Catholic and Irish nationalist, and its players had been violently attacked by a mob against its main rival Linfield in December 1948. Belfast Celtic were one of four clubs that attracted the biggest crowds in the Irish League, the other three being Linfield, Distillery, and Glentoran. Celtic Frost () were a Swiss extreme metal band from ZÃ¼rich. They are known for their strong influence on the development of extreme metal and avant-garde metal. Formed in 1981 as Hellhammer, the band became Celtic Frost in 1984 and released their debut, Morbid Tales, that year. This was followed by To Mega Therion (1985) and the highly experimental Into the Pandemonium (1987), all of which were widely praised.
