 White House adviser Kellyanne Conway is denying she suggested there was wider surveillance of President Donald Trump during the campaign, telling CNN Monday that her comments in a recent interview were taken out of context. Sunday night, Conway appeared to expand Trump's allegations that the Obama administration wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower -- a claim for which the President has not yet provided evidence -- when she told the Bergen Record there could have been even wider spying on the Trump campaign, including the use of microwaves and television sets. She did not provide any evidence for the claims. Pressed about the comments by CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day," Conway insisted she was not alleging actions by the Obama administration against the Trump campaign. Harvard constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe told The New York Times that "You couldn't think of a clearer example of violating the ban of using your government position as kind of a walking billboard for products or services offered by a private individual," adding "She is attempting quite crudely to enrich Ivanka and therefore the president's family." Chris Lu, deputy secretary of labor in the Obama administration, complained to Jason Chaffetz, chair of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, that Conway had violated federal ethics laws, also saying on Twitter that, under Obama, "If we did what @KellyannePolls did, we would've been fired". Richard Painter, chief ethics attorney for George W. Bush, declined to say whether he thought Conway's statements broke the law, but that such actions would not have been tolerated in the Bush administration. "The events of the past week demonstrate that there is no intent on the part of the president, his family or the White House staff to make meaningful distinctions between his official capacity as president and the Trump family business".  During her appearance Monday on CNN's "New Day," Kellyanne Conway says she was talking about "surveillance generally," walking back comments she made in an interview over the weekend suggesting surveillance of the Trump campaign may have been broader than wiretapping. Here are five key moments from her appearance Monday: Asked to clarify her comments on wiretapping, Conway, one of President Trump's top aides, said she was talking about general news articles on surveillance techniques saying: "I'm not Inspector Gadget. I don't believe people are using the microwave to spy on the Trump campaign." She shrugged off questions about providing any evidence of foul play that the Trump campaign may have, simply saying: "I'm not in the job of having evidence.
