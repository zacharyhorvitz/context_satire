 President Donald Trump has three weeks to find a new chief of staff -- but few seem to want the job. The White House went back to the drawing board Monday after the leading candidate for the position, Nick Ayers, announced he will not be taking the job, reviving discussions about who will take what is viewed as one of the most tumultuous and difficult jobs in Washington. Trump announced Saturday that current chief of staff John Kelly would be departing the White House at the end of the year. The change comes at the most politically turbulent time of Trump's presidency, which calls for a chief of staff who is adept in both politics and the ability to navigate the President's personality.  White House chief of staff John Kelly will be leaving his position at the end of the year, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Saturday afternoon. CNN on Friday reported that Kelly was expected to announce his departure in the coming days. "John Kelly will be leaving at the end of the year," Trump told reporters before departing the White House for the Army-Navy game. Trump noted Kelly had been with him for almost two years in his roles as chief of staff and secretary of homeland security.  Nick Ayers, the leading candidate to replace John Kelly as President Donald Trump's chief of staff, announced Sunday he will not be taking the job, reviving discussions about who will succeed the retired Marine general when he leaves at the end of the month. Ayers, who has served as Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff for more than a year, turned down the position because he could not agree to terms with the President, a White House official told CNN. Trump pushed Ayers to commit to two years, but he declined. He has young children, he told the President, and wants to move back to his home state of Georgia.
