 An appeals court has upheld an order to delay the execution of Texas death row inmate Patrick Henry Murphy, who was scheduled to die by lethal injection Wednesday. The execution is on hold for the second time in nearly eight months because of an ongoing court battle over his religious liberty rights. Murphy claims the state gives inmates who are Christian or Muslim greater access to spiritual advisers. Murphy has been a Buddhist for more than a decade.  Jimmy Fallon stunned three University of Texas at Austin students with a huge surprise. The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon was filming in Austin at Bass Concert Hall when he called up Texans Alma Zamora, Elizabeth Yun, and Fitzgerald Alan onto the stage. Fallon had them introduce themselves to the audience and then proceeded to tell them that Samsung had chosen them to win new smartphones and a holiday bundle with a bunch of cool gear. As the crowd went wild, and the students excitedly processed the news, Fallon decided to show them the camera feature and brought the students in for a selfie.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals blocked the execution of Rodney Reed Friday, allowing a lower court to consider Reed's claim that the state presented false testimony and that he is innocent. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended earlier Friday that Gov. Greg Abbott grant a 120-day reprieve to Reed. "This time is critical to allow for proper consideration of the powerful new evidence of his innocence and possible DNA testing that could help prove who actually committed the crime," said Bryce Benjet, Reed's Innocence Project attorney.
