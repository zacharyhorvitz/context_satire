When group eccentric Mary (Mary Pat Gleason) passes away unexpectedly during a meeting, the rest of the group is left to cope in various different ways: Jill throws an over-the-top memorial, Christy uses her legal skills to try and get Mary's grandson out of jail, Tammy fears that Marjorie will die next, Bonnie is distraught because the last thing she said to Mary was something mean, and Wendy becomes a shut-in after feeling that her friends don't care about her. Bonnie invites her troubled AA sponsee Patty to spend Christmas with her and Christy. While the combination of Patty's sad family status and Christy's stories of Bonnie's holiday mayhem and neglect drive Bonnie into a horrified, tearful reflection on her past self, she is able to pull herself out of it and do good work in the present. Elsewhere, Jill annoyingly obsesses over a picture Andy sent from his visit to Minnesota. Later, the group decides to join Wendy for some therapeutic caroling. Christy has gone back to school and is pursuing her dream of becoming a lawyer, while Bonnie attempts to have a healthy romantic relationship with her new husband, Adam (William Fichtner). Through it all, Christy and Bonnie rely on their support system from AA, including the wise Marjorie (Mimi Kennedy), the wealthy and sometimes misguided Jill (Jaime Pressly), the overly-emotional Wendy (Beth Hall), and the loudmouthed but sweet Tammy (Kristen Johnston). Collectively, they help each other stay sober in the face of whatever life throws at them.
