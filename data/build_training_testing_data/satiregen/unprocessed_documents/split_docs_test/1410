 Monday afternoon's devastating tornado in the Oklahoma City suburbs brought to mind a May 1999 EF5 twister that killed 36 people and smashed some of the same communities. On May 3, 1999, a total of 74 tornadoes pummeled Kansas and Oklahoma, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The states counted a total of 46 dead. Thirty-six died in Oklahoma City.  With everyone missing now accounted for from this week's deadly tornado, the long and difficult work of recovery can begin. "We are beginning the recovery operations," Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin told CNN's Piers Morgan late Wednesday. "There's a lot of debris removal going on throughout the public areas of the street," she said.  Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma is on 'Starting Point' talking with John Berman about the recent string of tornadoes that have hit his state including the devastating tornado that ripped through Moore, Oklahoma Monday evening. He states, 'All of the tornadoes are just devastating.' Senator Inhofe urges people to make small donations to the Red Cross or the Salvation Army because there are many residents of these towns in Oklahoma that have lost their homes and all of their possessions.
