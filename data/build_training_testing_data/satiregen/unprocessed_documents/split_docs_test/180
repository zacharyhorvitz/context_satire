Speak features different styles of music such as pop rock, dance-pop, teen pop, electropop and soft rock ballads. "I wanted to have a mixture like that because I love those kinds of club tracks that you can listen to before you go out at night with all your friends. And I also wanted stuff that was a little bit more rock that you could get into if you were like angry or depressed or sad or that. I wanted to be able to touch upon all those feelings and I wanted to speak about all different things, too, which is why I titled the album Speak", Lohan said in an interview with IGN. In the music video, Lohan is walking home when she sees her love interest, played by Drew Fuller, looking out of a window in his house as his mother sets the table behind him. Then his father comes up to him and they begin to argue. The curtains close and Lohan continues on to her house, next door to her boyfriend's, and runs up to her bedroom. Looking out her window, she sees that he is looking back at her. On August 5, 2008, Anderson Cooper appeared as a guest co-host on the ABC talk show Live with Regis and Kelly, during which he stated, in reference to Living Lohan, "I can't believe I'm wasting a minute of my life watching these horrific people". In an interview with OK! magazine, Dina Lohan responded, "people are just cruel...This is bad karma for him". Cooper did not respond directly to Lohan's comments but clarified that while he felt bad for Ali Lohan, he opined that she should be living the conventional life of a teenager, and not be made to star in a reality television show.
