 Donald Trump on Saturday again vowed to build a wall along the Mexico-U.S. border -- this time arguing that it would help stem New Hampshire's "drug epidemic." The appeal, made in a video posted to Facebook, comes three days before New Hampshire hosts the nation's first 2016 primary. "New Hampshire has a tremendous drug epidemic," Trump says. "I am going to create borders.  He bills himself as the ultimate winner -- but now Donald Trump says second place isn't so bad. Fresh from his first-ever election -- and his first-ever political loss -- the billionaire now faces pressure to show that his runner-up-spot in the Iowa caucuses was an aberration shaped by the unique politics of a state that was always stacked against him and is not a symptom of fundamental flaws in his entire campaign. It will be a mission that will unfold over the next week in New Hampshire, where Trump holds a commanding lead. And it will take place against a suddenly intense subplot of the GOP presidential race, a looming establishment bloodbath advanced by Marco Rubio's late sprint to a strong third in Iowa.  Goodbye, Iowa. The center of political gravity shifted east on Tuesday as presidential campaigns turned their focus to next week's New Hampshire primary. For Donald Trump, who claimed a disappointing second-place finish in Iowa on Monday night, the Granite State will be an opportunity for redemption. For several Republicans, New Hampshire on February 9 will be the make or break contest of the 2016 primary.
