Educated at Taverham High School, as a teenager she was spotted recording Stevie Wonder-influenced demos at The Kitchen in Norwich with her father (himself an experienced musician and local restaurateur) on piano. At the time she was working for Norwich Union. In 1986, Simon Fuller signed Dennis when she was only 17 to his 19 Management company and to label Polydor, and this began a career-long association with the impresario that has seen Dennis provide songs for many Fuller-related artists and projects. It has been suggested that the Britney Spears single "Toxic" was written about Fitzpatrick. One of the song's composers, Cathy Dennis, is a former girlfriend of Fitzpatrick's, who broke up with him about the time the song was written. However, Fitzpatrick's career and life were cut short in their prime. Only one year after his Derby success, the wasting regime he undertook to control his riding weight brought on a cold that killed him.
