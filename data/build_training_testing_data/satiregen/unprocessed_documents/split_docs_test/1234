The Turkish team once again narrowly missed out on the World Cup finals after failing to win a play-off, this time on away goals against Switzerland, again after finishing second in their group. There were scenes of violence after the game on and off the pitch where the Turkish team brawled with Swiss players down the tunnel.  A crowd estimated at more than 10,000 people marched silently on a bitterly cold day through downtown Istanbul Thursday to commemorate the five year anniversary of the murder of an ethnic Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. They walked carrying a sea of black signs declaring "We are all Hrant, we are all Armenian," written in Turkish and Armenian. Police, who put the crowd estimate at 10,000 or more, blocked off traffic as the crowds moved towards the offices of the Armenian language Agos newspaper. On January 19, 2007, Dink, the newspaper's editor in chief, was gunned down in broad daylight on the sidewalk outside the newspaper's offices. Although Turkey failed to qualify for the 1998 World Cup, they qualified for Euro 2000 after winning a play-off against the Republic of Ireland. Turkey lost their first match 2–1 to Italy, they drew their second match against Sweden 0–0, and beat host nation Belgium 2–0, making it the first time in the history of the UEFA European Championship a host nation had been eliminated in the first round. This victory brought Turkey into the last eight of the tournament, where they were beaten 2–0 by Portugal, with Arif Erdem missing a critical penalty.
