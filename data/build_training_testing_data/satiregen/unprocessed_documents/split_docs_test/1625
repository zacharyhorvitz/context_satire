 Republican Sen. Roy Blunt said Wednesday that President Donald Trump's decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military "deserves more than a Twitter conversation." Trump announced through his Twitter account on Wednesday that the military would not accept "Transgender individuals to  serve in any capacity," citing the costs and disruption allowing them to serve would entail. The move reverses the Obama administration's decision made in 2016 to allow transgender individuals to serve openly. Defense Secretary James Mattis recently said the defense department was delaying the Obama administration's decision to study the issue further. Instead of using existing Defense Department historians, McNamara assigned his close aide and Assistant Secretary of Defense John T. McNaughton to collect the papers. McNaughton died in a plane crash one month after work began in June 1967, but the project continued under the direction of Defense Department official Leslie H. Gelb. Thirty-six analysts—half of them active-duty military officers, the rest academics and civilian federal employees—worked on the study. The analysts largely used existing files in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  Secretary of Defense James Mattis has informed Congress that the US is withholding $50 million in funding from Pakistan because he was unable to certify that Islamabad "has taken sufficient action against the Haqqani Network," a branch of the Afghan Taliban. Such certification is necessary in order to enable Pakistan to receive reimbursement of "Coalition Support Funds" for 2016. The funds are used to reimburse Pakistan for the cost of military operations against terrorist groups during 2016. There was about $50 million remaining in the funds, which will now be repurposed the Pentagon said.
