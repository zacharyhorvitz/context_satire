 The view from Zou Yi's window is fickle. Some days he can see every detail of the Beijing Television skyscraper across the way. Some days he can hardly see it at all. Such is daily life for the millions who live under Beijing's polluted skies. Wang Feng was born in Beijing to a musician's family. Under his father's command, Wang started practicing violin when he was five years old. He attended the middle school attached to the Central Conservatory of Music at the age of eleven. Wang did not understand the purpose of playing violin, or why he had to stay home practising while other kids of his age could play outside.  Mark Zuckerberg met with China's propaganda chief on Saturday, but his latest Facebook post on China skipped right over that. The Facebook CEO shared photos of himself walking on the Great Wall, but made no mention of his meeting with Liu Yunshan, director of the Chinese Communist Party's Propaganda Department. "I'm in Beijing for the China Development Forum, where I'm meeting Chinese leaders from the public and private sectors," he wrote on Monday. Zuckerberg met with Liu the day after people called him out for "pandering" to the government for jogging through Beijing without a face mask.
