Snyder has been pressured to change the team's name by various fans, politicians, and advocacy groups who claim the word redskin is a derogatory term for Native Americans. In May 2013, in response to a question regarding the teams' Federal Trademark, Snyder told USA Today "We'll never change the name. It's that simple. NEVERâ€”you can use caps." "When people hear 'Snyder Cut' in their heads, they think about, like, a DVD they've seen of an extended cut or something that's finished. The 'Snyder Cut' that, again I haven't seen, but the one I've heard everyone speak of was never a finished film. It was a movie that people in production could watch and fill in the blanks. It was certainly not meant for mass consumption." Writing in Forbes magazine, Monte Burke states that distaste for Snyder has made the team name controversy worse than it needed to be, but there are others that also defend his position.
