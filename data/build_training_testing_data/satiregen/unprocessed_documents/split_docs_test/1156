 After running a year-long competition that drew interest from hundreds of cities and a number of states, Amazon has chosen New York City and Northern Virginia to split duty as its second headquarters. On Tuesday, Amazon announced it has chosen New York's Long Island City and Virginia's Arlington for HQ2. Both locations will receive a $2.5 billion investment from Amazon, and each will have more than 25,000 workers over time. Hiring begins next year.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won't take office until January, but the progressive firebrand is already casting herself as the voice of the people in the debate over Amazon's arrival in New York, even as fellow Democrats rushed to welcome the company. "Amazon is a billion-dollar company," Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter late Monday. "The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here." Amazon formally announced its choice Tuesday morning, naming New York and a location just outside of Washington, DC, to share its 50,000-employee second headquarters.  In the summer of 2013, Michael Bloomberg, then the mayor of New York, held a press conference to announce that Spotify would open an office in the city and hire more than 100 engineers by the following year. Bloomberg touted the announcement by Spotify, a music streaming service founded in Sweden, as validation of his efforts to "make New York City the first choice for tech companies to launch and grow." Five years later, New York may be on the cusp of two landmark tech industry announcements that would dwarf that Spotify news and cement the Big Apple as a big tech hub to rival Silicon Valley. Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL) are reportedly planning massive New York expansions with thousands of new employees.
