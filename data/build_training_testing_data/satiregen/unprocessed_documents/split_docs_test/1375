Mr. Banks walks through London to the bank, where he is given a humiliating cashiering and is dismissed. Looking to the tuppence for words, he blurts out "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious," tells a joke, and happily heads home. Dawes Sr. mulls over the joke and, finally understanding it, floats up into the air, laughing.  The likelihood of someone winning the estimated $1.5 billion jackpot in the Powerball lottery on Wednesday is very slim. And that's not just because the odds of winning are 292 million to one. It's because the jackpot is actually $930 million (before taxes) if the winner decides to take a lump sum payment. And almost all winners opt for the lump sum.  Winning the Powerball jackpot means big money. But what about the people who sold the winning tickets? The Powerball drawing on Wednesday night produced three winning tickets in Chino Hills, California; Munford, Tennessee; and Melbourne Beach, Florida. California has the biggest reward for the ticket seller -- $1 million.
