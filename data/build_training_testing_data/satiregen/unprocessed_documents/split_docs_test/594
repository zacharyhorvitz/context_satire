Hettie Shumway was highly involved with the Rochester Institute of Technology and also with the institute's addition of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. Hettie was on the Women's Council of the Rochester Institute of Technology and acted as president from 1959 to 1965. She was also a member of the board of trustees of RIT from 1959 to 1965. Mrs. Shumway was a strong advocate for the campus to be moved to Henrietta, which it eventually was. The University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) is the primary campus for the university's medical education and research as well as the main patient care facility. The Medical Center is next to the River Campus and is dominated by Strong Memorial Hospital, the School of Medicine and Dentistry building and the Arthur Kornberg Medical Research Building. URMC also houses the School of Nursing and a variety of research centers, including the Wilmot Cancer Center, the Aab Institute of Biomedical Sciences, and the Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. In response, the University commissioned a study to determine if the name of the institution should be changed to "Eastman University" or "Eastman Rochester University". The study concluded a name change could be beneficial because the use of a place name in the title led respondents to incorrectly believe it was a public university, and because the name "Rochester" connoted a "cold and distant outpost." Reports of the latter conclusion led to controversy and criticism in the Rochester community. Ultimately, the name "University of Rochester" was retained.
