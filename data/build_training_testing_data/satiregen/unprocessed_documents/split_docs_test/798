 Twitter doubled the character count for some users on Tuesday. Predictably, its users freaked out. For the first time, the social network lifted its tweet character limit from 140 to 280 among a test pool of users. The company, which anticipated the backlash, was quick to respond.  If brevity is the soul of wit, Twitter is about to get a lot less clever. For the first time in history, Twitter is changing its character limit. The service announced on Tuesday it is doubling its character count for tweets -- from 140 characters to 280 characters -- for some of its users. The test group will include those who tweet in certain languages, including English, Spanish and Portuguese.  Twitter hasn't said who exactly is in the test group for its longer tweets, but now we know one user who isn't: Donald Trump. On Tuesday, Twitter announced it would test doubling the character limit of tweets as part of an ongoing effort to make the social network more intuitive and appealing. The announcement quickly set off speculation and alarm bells among some users who worried what President Trump, a prolific tweeter, might do with all the extra space. In response, Twitter cofounder Biz Stone said President Trump is "not in the test group" for the expanded tweets.
