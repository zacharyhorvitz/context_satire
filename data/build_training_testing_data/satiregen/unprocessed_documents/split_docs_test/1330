 "I'm sorry." With those simple words, Hillary Clinton, who thought she would wake up Wednesday as the first woman president-elect but crashed to a stunning election defeat to Donald Trump, ended her White House quest and likely her political career. The Democratic nominee unequivocally conceded the presidential race, and said that the Constitution requires a peaceful transfer of power.

In a statement, Warren brought up a focal point of Trump's campaign: his promise to rebuild the economy as an area for collaboration. "President-elect Trump promised to rebuild our economy for working people, and I offer to put aside our differences and work with him on that task," she wrote. "But the integrity of our democracy is more important than any individual election," Sen. Warren said, echoing President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's remarks from earlier today.
