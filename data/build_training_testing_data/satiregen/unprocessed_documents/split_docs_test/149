Barry Sullivan redefined the term "leading man", being neither a genuine star, although billed above the title, nor a character actor, since he was seldom called upon to play anyone but himself - nice and reliable, the old standby. There were many others of his generation competing for the same roles - Wendell Corey, with his somewhat charming gloom, the cynical but easygoing Van Heflin, the acquiescent but dangerous Robert Ryan. Many cinemagoers found the Sullivans and Ryans more rewarding than the bona fide box-office champs but, like them, they could be counted upon when it came to facing up to the great ladies of the screen. The hype for Come Play with Me also spread to the letters pages of Sullivan’s magazines. A fan letter of dubious authenticity (as it refers to scenes that do not appear in the film) from "Bert U" to Mary Millington in issue 27 of Whitehouse claims: "Dear Mary, I must congratulate you on your film Come Play with Me, I found it screamingly funny and very sexy as well…I loved every randy moment… everyone was so natural, and Henry McGhee  as the PM was superb." The letter goes on to falsely claim that the actor Roy Kinnear appears in the film, and that "(Roy) looked like a Roman Emperor in the swimming pool scene. I‘ll bet it took him all his time to keep his towel on during rehearsals for the film… it looked to me, Mary, as though you were fucked rigid during the film". In December 2019, it was reported by The Sun that Rita would feature in a big storyline over Christmas. Producer Ian Macleod relished the chance to give Barbara Knox the spotlight after all of these decades in Weatherfield. "It's a really good story actually and Barbara Knox, as is always the case, if you give her something big to do she nails it," he said. "I'm not saying that with any hint of surprise in my voice, she's been doing it for decades.
