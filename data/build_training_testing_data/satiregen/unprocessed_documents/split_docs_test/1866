In a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and Jeff Milyo argue the Journal's news pages have a pro-liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks. They calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular think tanks and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks. They found that the news reporting of The Journal was the most liberal (more liberal than NPR or The New York Times). The study did not factor in editorials. The Daily Journal was first published in Old Town Albuquerque, but in 1882 the publication moved to a single room in the so-called new town (or expanded Albuquerque) at Second and Silver streets near the railroad tracks. It was published on a single sheet of newsprint, folded to make four pages. Those pages were divided into five columns with small headlines. Advertising appeared on the front page. Although it is the journal of the AAAS, membership in the AAAS is not required to publish in Science. Papers are accepted from authors around the world. Competition to publish in Science is very intense, as an article published in such a highly cited journal can lead to attention and career advancement for the authors. Fewer than 7% of articles submitted are accepted for publication.
