 Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid announced Wednesday in an exclusive interview with CNN that he is endorsing Hillary Clinton for president, a sign that Democratic leaders are eager to put the party's contentious primary fight behind them. The Nevada Democrat issued a plea for his party to consolidate behind Clinton, who has struggled to fend off an insurgent campaign from Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont. "I think the middle class would be better served by Hillary," Reid said. "I think that my work with her over the years has been something that I have looked upon with awe.  Polls heading into the Nevada Democratic caucuses showed the two contenders neck-and-neck, so Hillary Clinton can thank the late deciders -- people who made up their minds in the least few days -- for the victory. More specifically, she can thank 29-year-old Vanessa McCallum. Saturday's decision was difficult for her down to the final moments, when she had to decide whether to sit on the Bernie Sanders or Clinton side of the caucus at Caesar's Palace.

When Bill Clinton took office as president in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first lady. Her press secretary reiterated she would be using that form of her name. She was the first in this role to have a postgraduate degree and her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House. She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.
