 Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley says he has yet to hear back from Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of committing sexual and physical assault while they were both in high school. Tuesday morning, Grassley told Hugh Hewitt on his radio show that Ford has not accepted his request to appear before the committee. "We have reached out to her in the last 36 hours, three or four times, by email, and we have not heard from them," Grassley said. "So it kind of raises the question, do they want to come to the public hearing or not?"  Mark Judge has no memory of the alleged sexual assault committed by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, he said in a letter Tuesday to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Christine Blasey Ford has accused Kavanaugh of assaulting her in the early 1980s, and said Judge was also in the room. Judge denied the incident and his lawyer said he has no plans to speak publicly. "I have no memory of this alleged incident," Judge states in the letter sent by his lawyer, Barbara Van Gelder.  Sen. Doug Jones said on Tuesday that the Senate Judiciary Committee should demand testimony from Mark Judge, who has denied witnessing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh assaulting Christine Blasey Ford decades ago. "I think this committee ought to subpoena Mark Judge to come forward," the Alabama Democrat told CNN's Jim Acosta on "The Situation Room." Ford has alleged that while at a party during their high school years, Kavanaugh pushed her into a bedroom and assaulted her. She said Judge was in the room as well and that both boys were "stumbling drunk" and laughing while Kavanaugh held her down and tried to remove her clothes.
