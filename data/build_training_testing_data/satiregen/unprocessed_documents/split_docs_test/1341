 Hillary Clinton will take a break from campaigning in New Hampshire on Sunday and visit Flint, Michigan, in an effort to highlight to city's water crisis, according to a Clinton aides. Clinton hopes the trip with shine a spotlight on the tainted water crisis plaguing the city, where officials did not properly treat water being pumped into homes, leaving people exposed to lead and other contaminants. Clinton, according to aides, "intends to use her trip to Flint to urge the Republican-contolled Senate to approve the Senate Democrats' $600 million amendment to help Flint." The announcement comes on the same day that Senate Democrats blocked an energy bill over funding for Flint. The nature of the contest fractured in the next few days. Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates, and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson, were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign. Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans. She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary, setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two FebruaryÂ 5 Super Tuesday states. After South Carolina, the Clinton campaign sought to find a "gentler" role for Bill Clinton, whose actions during the South Carolina campaign and earlier was suspected of having polarized the Democrat electorate and harming Hillary Clinton's standing among women, in addition to having contributed to Ted Kennedy's decision to endorse Obama. Congressman Charles Rangel, an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter, said of Bill Clinton, "He's got to . The focus has got to get back on Hillary. For all that he cares about his wife, this has to be her election to win, and it's become too much about his role."
