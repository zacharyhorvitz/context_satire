 Sven Elverfeld doesn't get out much. The German chef, who heads Aqua at the Ritz-Carlton in Wolfsburg, is not one of those culinary libertines who spend half the year in the skies, leaving their underlings to knock out the tournedos and timbales at home while they stage pop-ups and guest appearances at fun locations abroad. If he's away for more than a few days, the Aqua kitchen goes dark -- which is maybe one reason why it's held on to its three Michelin stars since 2009. But Elverfeld has trusted his team to keep the hobs burning for the best part of a week as he makes the 13-hour trek to Thailand for the second Gelinaz Shuffle, an ambitious, slightly crazy project in which 40 of the world's top chefs take over each other's kitchens on the same night. After the cancellation of Baywatch Nights, Mitch continued on the original series, now promoted to Captain. Nights was once more alluded to in a tongue-in-cheek manner in the Season 8 episode, "Eel Nino," where an electric eel had been terrorizing beachgoers. When some of the lifeguards (not yet knowing it was an electric eel), speculated that it could be an alien, Mitch, annoyed, told them, "This is not the X-Files." The series then returned to a reasonably more realistic format from that point on. In 2005, Albom and four editors were briefly suspended from the Detroit Free Press after Albom wrote a column that stated that two college basketball players were in the crowd at an NCAA tournament game when in fact they were not. In a column printed in the April 3, 2005 edition, Albom described two former Michigan State basketball players, both then in the NBA, attending an NCAA Final Four semifinal game on Saturday to cheer for their school. The players had told Albom they planned to attend, so Albom, filing on his normal Friday deadline but knowing the column could not come out until Sunday (after the game was over) wrote that the players were there. But the players' plans changed at the last minute and they did not attend the game.
