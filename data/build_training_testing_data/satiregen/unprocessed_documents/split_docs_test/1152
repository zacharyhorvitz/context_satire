Luckiest Girl Alive is a 2015 New York Times Bestselling mystery novel written by the American author, Jessica Knoll, and is her debut work. It was first published on May 12, 2015, by Simon & Schuster in the United States, and Pan Macmillan in Australia, and is written in the first person narrative. The novel follows a young woman who has sought to reinvent herself in her adult life, following a series of horrifying events during her teenage years. During the book the lead character, Ani Fanelli, is also referred to by several different names: TifAni FaNelli, Tif, and Finny. At first glance, 28-year-old Ani appears to have a perfect life. She works as an editor at a glamorous women's magazine and has a loving fiancé from a good family. Yet Ani also hides a secret – as a teenager she underwent a series of horrifying and emotionally crippling events, including a school shooting, that have continued to impact her well into her adult years. During the course of the novel, it is revealed Ani was gang raped when she was 14. While writing the novel, Knoll drew upon her own experiences of being gang raped and bullied as a teenager. Knoll did not initially make this public knowledge while promoting the book, at first telling fans  she based the rape and aftermath on stories she had heard from others. In March 2016, Knoll wrote an essay for the online feminist newsletter Lenny Letter, describing her experiences as a rape survivor. She further stated that she came forward after interacting with several fellow rape survivors at book signings.
