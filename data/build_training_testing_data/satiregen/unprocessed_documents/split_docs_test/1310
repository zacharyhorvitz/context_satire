 Forget Ashton Kutcher and Aaron Sorkin. The next Steve Jobs biopic you see will star the "I'm a Mac" guy and come from the twisted minds of Funny or Die. The comedy website confirmed Tuesday that it's planning its own feature-length version of the Apple co-founder's life, "iSteve." Starring as Jobs will be Justin Long, whom most people know from Apple's "I'm a Mac-I'm a PC" ads but who also appeared in TV's "Ed" and "New Girl" and films like "Live Free or Die Hard," "Drag Me to Hell" and "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story." Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, writing: "The beauty in this film is in its directness. There are some obligatory scenes. But there are also some very original and touching ones. This is a movie that has its heart in the right place." Home Alone is primarily a coming-of-age story about an 8-year-old boy named Kevin McCallister. He is the youngest of five children who is frequently tormented by his older brothers and sisters. After events transpire between him and his family, he wishes he had no family when his mother is punishing him for what he feels are unjustified reasons. She warns him to be careful what he wishes for and he ignores it.
