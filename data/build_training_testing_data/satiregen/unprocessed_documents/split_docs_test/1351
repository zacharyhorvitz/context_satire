 Facebook really wants to gain the trust of publishers after a contentious year of fake news and algorithm changes, as well as concerns the giant social network is squeezing out news sites. At a panel discussion at the SXSW conference, Facebook's head of news product, Alex Hardiman, said Facebook is "redefining its relationship" with publishers. The company is experimenting with new products and services to better serve news organizations and promote accurate journalism, she said. "As we are making the shift to quality, everything is on the table," Hardiman said on Friday.  In 2016, more than a quarter of Americans read online stories that were "fake news" -- or deliberately false information or propaganda disguised as actual news reporting, researchers found. The most successful fake election news on Facebook generated more engagement than the top stories from The New York Times, The Washington Post, Huffington Post, NBC News and others, another analysis showed. The overall problem of fake news, however, is much bigger than election interference. After October's mass shooting in Las Vegas, the top Google News results included links to fake news and conspiracy theories.  Facebook's first black eye was from "fake news." The social network's secretive algorithm enabled hoaxes and lies to reach millions of people during the US presidential campaign in 2016. Analysts were taken aback by the scope of the problem. Facebook vowed to make changes.
