 It's not as super as it has been in previous elections with more states involved, but 10 states have their say Tuesday in one of the most volatile Republican presidential races in generations. Here are three things to watch for:  Romney's big day. He's been the off-and-on frontrunner throughout the race, but a big Super Tuesday could begin an end game toward a sometimes hesitant base coalescing behind former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. This the electoral history of Mitt Romney, the 70th Governor of Massachusetts (2003â€“2007) and a candidate for: the United States Senate in 1994 and President of the United States in 2008 and 2012. In 2018, Romney declared that he was a candidate for the United States Senate in the state of Utah.  In a year when electability consistently tops Republican primary voters' lists of candidate qualities, Mitt Romney has made the sale. In contest after contest, he's generally chosen as the contender most likely to beat President Barack Obama in November. On Tuesday, voters in Ohio agreed: They thought he was roughly twice as electable as Rick Santorum, according to exit polls. But if Romney has primary voters' heads, Santorum seems to be reaching their hearts.
