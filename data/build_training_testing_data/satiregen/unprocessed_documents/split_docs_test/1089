The United Nations Trusteeship Council, one of the principal organs of the United Nations, was established to ensure that trust territories were administered in the best interests of their inhabitants and of international peace and security. The trust territories—most of them are former mandates of the League of Nations or territories taken from nations defeated at the end of World War II—have all now attained self-government or independence, either as separate nations or by joining neighbouring independent countries. The last was Palau, formerly part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which became a member state of the United Nations in December 1994.  Staffan de Mistura -- who has been the United Nations' top emissary in Iraq, Afghanistan and other once-volatile locales -- is moving on to Syria, in the hope of turning the tide after years of war there. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced Thursday that de Mistura will take on role as the world body's official facilitator on Syria. That position as the U.N.'s Syria envoy was formerly held by Lakhdar Brahimi and, before that, former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Despite considerable, high-level efforts, neither managed to halt a conflict that -- according to the United Nations -- has left more than 150,00 dead and some 680,000 injured since it began in March 2011. In October 2011 city and state officials announced an agreement in which the UN would be allowed to build a long-sought new office tower just south of the existing campus on the current Robert Moses Playground, which would be relocated. In exchange, the United Nations would allow the construction of an esplanade along the East River that would complete the East River Greenway, a waterfront pedestrian and bicycle pathway. While host nation authorities have agreed to the provisions of the plan, it needs the approval of the United Nations in order to be implemented. The plan is similar in concept to an earlier proposal that had been announced in 2000 but did not move forward.
