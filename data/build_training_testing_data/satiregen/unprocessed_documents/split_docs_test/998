19-year-old Edwards was cast in the role after being seen in a musical by one of the directors of EastEnders. The casting was announced on 13 May 2008, when he was described as "mysterious". Speaking of his casting, Edwards said, "It is just amazing. Everybody is lovely on the set. Ashley Iocco (born October 30, 1985), 26, originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is the owner of a mobile spray-tanning company in West Hollywood, California called Bronzique. Ashley describes herself as vivacious, loving, charismatic, and enthusiastic. Her favorite activities include hiking, yoga, making dream boards, sunbathing, swimming, snowboarding, and boating. Ashley's strategy coming into the Big Brother house was to play everyone, come off as a ditzy blonde but take it to the end because she's actually really smart and good at reading through people's lies. On Ashley's first day of college, investigators came to her school to question her about her father's death and to inform her that he had been poisoned instead of having died of a heart attack. An upset Ashley called Castor. Soon after, Ashley said, Castor invited her to come to the family home in Liverpool and drink together. Castor said that they had been through enough emotional stress and needed to relax.
