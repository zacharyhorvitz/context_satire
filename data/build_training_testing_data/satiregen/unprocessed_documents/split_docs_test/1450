In 2015, Halfon admitted an affair with a party activist with whom he had been working, after he was warned that a Conservative aide was trying to blackmail him over the relationship. Halfon alleged that the controversial former Conservative Parliamentary candidate Mark Clarke, dubbed the "Tatler Tory", was attempting to attempt to blackmail him to further his own career advancement within the Party. Halfon was further criticised after it was reported by The Guardian newspaper that he had claimed over Â£30,000 in expenses to illicitly meet the woman with whom he was having the affair, when staying at the East India Club in London. Halfon's spokeswoman responded that the woman with whom Halfon had an affair had not actually stayed at the club for the whole of the nights in question. In his maiden speech, Hunt stated that he had been diagnosed with both dyslexia and dyspraxia during his schooling. Regarding children with special educational needs, he said that as a Member of Parliament he would dedicate himself "to helping these children to ensure that they have every opportunity to achieve their full potential and that that their talents are not lost to society". Halfon has said that one of the three things that motivate him in politics is "unashamed support for the State of Israel, as the only real democracy and progressive force in the Middle East". He says: "I have always been very supportive of Israel. I have been to Israel many times for work and family, especially now that my father, who has become more Orthodox, lives in Jerusalem. I talk a lot about Israel in the House of Commons."
