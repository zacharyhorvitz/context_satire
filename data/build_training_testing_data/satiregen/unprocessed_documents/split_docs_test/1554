 It's not just Mexico that isn't paying for the wall -- Congress isn't either, apparently. But President Donald Trump isn't ready to break it to his supporters just yet. Rather than selling a potential breakthrough, reached on Capitol Hill to stave off a new partial government shutdown, Trump revived the molten rhetoric on immigration that helped make him President at a boisterous campaign rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday night. The drama provided an eloquent snapshot of the political forces over immigration tearing at the cohesion of the Republican Party.  A photojournalist for the BBC was attacked Monday while covering President Donald Trump's rally in El Paso, Texas. A rallygoer gained access to an area designated for the news media and began shoving people, according to video of the incident. No one was seriously hurt. But it is the latest example of anti-media hostility boiling over at Trump's campaign events.  As a cameraman with 25 years' experience working at the BBC, Ron Skeans probably knows a thing or two about hostile environments. His colleagues have been killed and injured working in war zones and dictatorships the world over. But when Skeans landed the plum job in the corporation's Washington DC bureau in 1994, he surely didn't expect to come under physical threat while covering the rarified arena of US politics. Of course, that was before the arrival of Donald Trump as commander in chief.
