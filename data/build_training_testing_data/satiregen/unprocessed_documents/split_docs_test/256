 The Senate's chaplain began Wednesday's proceedings in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump with a prayer urging senators to "remember that patriots reside on both sides of the aisle," a pointed prayer that came hours after Chief Justice John Roberts scolded Democrats and Republicans for their bellicose tone on the trial's first full day. "Sovereign God, author of liberty, we gather in this historic chamber for the solemn responsibility of these impeachment proceedings. Give wisdom to the distinguished Chief Justice John Roberts as he presides. Lord, you are all powerful and know our thoughts before we form them," Chaplain Barry Black said in his prayer before the proceedings.  When Chief Justice John Roberts issued an extraordinary admonishment of Democrats and Republicans on the first day of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, he not only reminded speakers to maintain decorum but used a seldom-uttered word -- pettifogging -- to make his point. Roberts had just listened to the impeachment managers and Trump's legal team sharply criticize each other early Wednesday morning after House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, made the case for issuing a subpoena for former national security adviser John Bolton's testimony. Roberts said that kind of exchange was not appropriate and, providing a historical example, reminded the legal teams they they need to be on their best behavior. LIVE UPDATES: Impeachment trial of President Trump "In the 1905 Swayne trial, a senator objected when one of the managers used the word 'pettifogging' and the presiding officer said the word ought not to have been used," Roberts said.  Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, scolded both the Democratic House managers and the President's defense team early Wednesday morning after a contentious exchange on the Senate floor. The extraordinary moment capped an acrimonious opening to Trump's impeachment trial, and placed Roberts, who otherwise largely handled procedural tasks on day 1, in the position of reminding advocates for both sides to maintain decorum during a highly partisan affair. "I think it is appropriate for me to admonish both the House managers and the President's counsel in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world's greatest deliberative body," Roberts said. "One reason it has earned that title is because its members avoid speaking in a manner and using language that is not conducive to civil discourse."
