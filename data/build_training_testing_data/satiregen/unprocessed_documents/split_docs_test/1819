 Dick's Sporting Goods expected some backlash when it said it would stop selling assault-style rifles. Instead, it got flowers. "We have been humbled by the calls, emails, tweets and posts of support that so many of you have sent following our announcement on Wednesday," Dick's Sporting Goods tweeted on Friday. "Our stores are grateful to those of you who have stopped in to share kind words, flowers and donuts."  Dick's Sporting Goods, the nation's largest sporting goods retailer, will stop selling assault-style weapons like the one used in the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting. The company said it will also raise the minimum age for all gun sales to 21. Dick's will not sell high-capacity magazines that allow shooters to fire far more rounds than traditional weapons without reloading, as well as other accessories used with weapons similar to the AR-15. The company expects criticism from gun rights advocates as well a hit to sales, Dick's CEO Edward Stack said on CNN's "New Day."  L.L. Bean became the latest retailer to announce that it will no longer sell guns or ammunition to customers younger than 21. In response to a tweet from one consumer asking the outdoors retailer to change its policy, the Maine-based retailer replied late Thursday, "In the wake of this shooting we have reviewed our policy on firearm sales, and we will no longer be selling guns or ammunition to anyone under the age of 21." It's the fourth high-profile retailer to change its policy on gun sales to younger customers in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting last month.
