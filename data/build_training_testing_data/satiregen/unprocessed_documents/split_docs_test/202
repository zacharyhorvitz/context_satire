The College Dropout was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number two on the Billboard 200 as his debut single, "Through the Wire" peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks. "Slow Jamz", his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even bigger success: it became the three musicians' first number one hit. The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. "Jesus Walks", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. 2009 was a troubled year for Kanye West, who had faced various controversies, including the divisive nature of his previous album, 808s & Heartbreak and his interruption of recording artist Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards during her acceptance speech. West explained that the motivation of some of his questionable decisions stemmed from over-work. The ensuing media controversy caused West to exile himself in Oahu, Hawaii and record his fifth studio album mostly in a reclusive nature, shying away from collaborating with artists he wasn't personally close to. While composing the album, West assembled a large staff of established producers including Pete Rock, the RZA and Q-Tip, with West handling portions of the production himself. West was the musical guest for the season 44 premiere of Saturday Night Live, slated to coincide with the release of Yandhi on September 29, 2018. Universal Music Publishing Group accidentally leaked that this initial version of the album was to be eight tracks long, with Ant Clemons contributing to seven tracks. After the album went unreleased, Kardashian later announced a rescheduled date of November 23, 2018. That same day, West visited the TMZ offices for an interview, admitting that the album wasn't actually finished yet and that he would be going to Africa in two weeks to continue recording for Yandhi.
