 President Donald Trump ordered the firing of special counsel Robert Mueller last June, only to be talked out of doing so when White House general counsel Don McGahn refused to follow through because he disagreed with the President's reasoning, a source told CNN Thursday night. That's a wow. Especially because time and time again over the past year, Trump -- and his senior advisers -- have insisted that he had never, ever, never, not once considered anything like firing Mueller. "I haven't given it any thought," Trump replied in August -- two months after he reportedly ordered Mueller fired --- to a question from a reporter as to whether he had considered firing the special counsel.  President Donald Trump denied on Friday that he had moved to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. He had called for the firing last June, according to one person familiar with the matter. White House counsel Don McGahn refused to order the Justice Department to fire Mueller because he disagreed with the President's reasoning, the source said. However, according to the source, McGahn did not threaten to resign directly to the President.  Months after his reported effort to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, President Donald Trump is still fuming over the Russia investigation and has Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in his crosshairs. The President has been venting about Rosenstein -- who oversees Mueller and the special counsel investigation -- in recent weeks, according to four sources familiar with the situation. At times, Trump even gripes about wanting Rosenstein removed, two of those sources said. One source said the President makes comments like "let's fire him, let's get rid of him" before his advisers convince him it's an ill-fated idea.
