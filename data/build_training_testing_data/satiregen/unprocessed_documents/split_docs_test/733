Every year, more than 350 companies and organizations are represented in the Midwest Clinic's exhibit halls, located in the Hilton Chicago. Exhibits are open Wednesday through Friday and include publishing companies, instrument manufacturers, fundraising companies, travel/tour agencies, and colleges and universities, among others. Kjos Music Company, one of the founding sponsors of the clinic, has exhibited at every Midwest Clinic since its beginning in 1946. The C. L. Barnhouse Company is the only other firm to have exhibited at all Midwest Clinics since 1946. Grant's many enemies include Hollis Greene, the leader and prophet of a rival polygamous cult. Their enmity seems to go back for many decades but most recently has centered upon Juniper Creek's business interests and has resulted in violence from and against both sides. After stepping out of his favorite diner near the Juniper Creek compound, two women associated with Greene walked up unexpectedly, announced his name, and shot Grant three times, then ran off. When Adaleen Grant sneaks into her husband's room and witnesses Alby drugging Roman, she sneaks out of the compound with Grant and takes him to her daughter Nicolette's house where he remains until Bill sends him back to the compound.
