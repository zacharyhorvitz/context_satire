 Apple is betting its future on a $1,000 phone. On Tuesday, Apple unveiled new smartwatches, an Apple TV and the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus at a press event. But the showstopper was a premium device called iPhone X, with a starting price that would have once seemed laughable for a phone: $999. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, framed the device as being nothing short of "the future of the smartphone."  Ten years after the launch of the first iPhone, Apple has revealed the iPhone X. It has no home button, scans your face to log you in and costs $999. The company unveiled the anniversary edition smartphone, alongside an iPhone 8 and its bigger sibling, the iPhone 8 Plus, at a press event at the brand new Apple Park campus in Cupertino on Tuesday. The company also announced a new Apple Watch with a cellular connection, an Apple TV that streams 4K video, and gave the public its first peek at the circular Steve Jobs Theater.  More than 10 years after Steve Jobs announced the original iPhone in San Francisco, Apple is preparing for another landmark event. Some things will be different. Tim Cook will be on stage, and the location will be Apple's brand new campus in Cupertino. But the star of the show will still be the iPhone.
