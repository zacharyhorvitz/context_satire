She then appeared in the drama Vision Quest (1985), followed by a lead role in Rob Reiner's The Sure Thing (1985), opposite John Cusack. The film was critically praised; critic Roger Ebert said of the film: "The movie industry seems better at teenage movies like Porky's, with its sleazy shower scenes, than with screenplays that involve any sort of thought about the love lives of its characters. That's why The Sure Thing is a small miracle." Shortly after, Zuniga was cast in the television drama film Stone Pillow (1985), playing a social worker in New York City who forms a bond with an elderly homeless woman, played by Lucille Ball. Following his war movie, Kevin becomes obsessed with learning about Jack's time in the Vietnam War, and with the aid of Zoe Baker, Beth's cousin, with whom he falls in love, he travels to Vietnam in an attempt to learn about Jack's history, and ends up discovering his long-believed-dead uncle Nicky. After finding Nicky in his old run down trailer, he offers to help him get back on track, but he refuses. This triggers him to relapse after a year sober. At the end of season three, Kevin and Zoe breakup after Zoe tells Kevin that she will never want kids. Zuniga made her film debut in Stephen Carpenter's slasher film The Dorm That Dripped Blood (1982), playing a supporting role as a college coed. Two years later, she made her lead debut in The Initiation, another college-themed slasher co-starring Vera Miles and Clu Gulager. "It was a great part," Zuniga recalled. "I got to play twins: a good sister and an evil sister.
