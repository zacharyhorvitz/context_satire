Alex Forbes attends a boarding school where his father is principal. A new student, Nigel Colbie, is placed in Alex's room. Nigel has a father who is in the same secret society as Alex's father. Nigel, however, is unusual, and in Alex's words "had this morbid fascination with all things dead." According to Lehman, the concept is just a description of how ideas work, not advocacy of extreme policy proposals. In an interview with the New York Times, he said, "It just explains how ideas come in and out of fashion, the same way that gravity explains why something falls to the earth.

Adam is heartbroken when she breaks up with him, then finds himself in the odd predicament of being a "dear friend" invited to her wedding a year and a half later. At the rehearsal dinner, he is introduced by another friend as the guy who dated Allison "...literally, right before Aaron", the groom, started dating her. This leads to a sequence of events that eventually leads to Aaron chasing after him during the reception until he enters a bus and leaves.
