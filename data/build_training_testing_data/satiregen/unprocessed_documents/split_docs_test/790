Insane Clown Posse, often abbreviated as ICP, is an American hip hop duo composed of Violent J (Joseph Bruce) and Shaggy 2 Dope (originally 2 Dope; Joseph Utsler). Founded in Detroit in 1989, Insane Clown Posse performs a style of hardcore hip hop known as horrorcore and is known for its elaborate live performances. The duo has earned two platinum and five gold albums. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the entire catalog of the group has sold 6.5 million units in the United States and Canada as of April 2007. On October 5, 2017 Insane Clown Posse held a "Surprize Guerrilla Show" featuring Anybody Killa, DJ Clay, Big Hoodoo, and Lyte for $5. It was said that a music video would be shot the same night as well. The video featured the whole label including the new artist Ouija Macc of the group Swag Toof. The video was to include Anybody Killa, but didn't because his van broke down causing him to be late for the video. On tour following the release of Dog Beats, Insane Clown Posse was scheduled to perform at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan, but were delayed by a blizzard. After they arrived, the group was announced by their manager, Alex Abbiss. Bruce remembers that "e came out with no microphones or nothing; we were just right up in the people's faces. Shaggy and I were just fuckin' yelling over our own cassette.
