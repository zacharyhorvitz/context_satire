 A federal bankruptcy judge denied American Airlines' plan to give its CEO a $20 million severance package, saying bankruptcy law prevents such rich "golden parachutes." But the airline says it will continue to push for CEO Tom Horton to get the payoff. And the judge left the door open to reconsider the request in future, or for the company to approve the windfall for Horton once its merger with US Airways is complete. Horton is losing his CEO position when American and US Airways merge, which is expected to take place later this year.  Two pilots, an American and a Canadian, were killed Saturday when the small aircraft they were flying crashed into a house in Guyana, officials said.

The plane crashed into a house in the coastal village of Sparendaam, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) east of the capital city of Georgetown, authorities said.
